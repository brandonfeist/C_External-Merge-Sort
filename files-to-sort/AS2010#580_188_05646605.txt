Abstract - Environment, customs and health status in 
northwest minority areas have been studied. We found the 
critical factors to prevent cerebral infraction. First rough 
sets theory had been used to reduce the attributes, secondly 
association rules had been used, finally logistic regression 
model had been used. The model solved the shortcomings of 
too many rules that caused by attribute redundancy and 
reliability framework. The results show that the history of 
other cerebrovascular disease, alcohol consumption and 
seasonal change are the significant factors of cerebral 
infraction.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Data mmmg has been a hot issue in knowledge 
management. The association analysis is widely used. 
Association analysis is often used in market analysis, 
financial data analysis and census areas [II, while in the 
field of preventive medicine is rare[21, moreover in the 
filed of preventive medicine the most difficult thing is too 
many affecting factors. These factors will lead association 
analysis often produce lunge redundant rules and rough 
rules. Hence, we gave some research work on overcoming 
these difficulties in this paper. 
Rough sets theory was firstly introduced by Pawlak in 
1982 [31;[41,as a valuable mathematical tool to deal with 
vagueness and uncertainty [51. In the Rough set approach, 
any vague concept is characterized by pair of precise 
concepts, that is the lower and upper concept 
approximation [51.Using lower and upper approximation of 
a set, the accuracy and the quality of approximation can 
be defined, as well as the knowledge hidden in the data 
table may be discovered and expressed in the form of 
decision rules [61. 
Association analysis is used to discover interesting 
relationships hidden in large data sets. While the Apriori 
association rules mining algorithm will generate a large 
number of redundant candidate sets and frequently 
scanning of the database. In regarding to these 
shortcomings many scholars have put forward improved 
algorithms to improve the efficiency. However, in 
practice, association rules are not as useful as people

expect, a major drawback is that support framework often 
generate too much confidence rules so we need to use 
statistical knowledge to add values to the rules. So we 
will introduce the logistic regression model to do the 
further statistical test on the rules generated by the 
association analysis. Separating the major factors to 
strength the practical direction and deploys a rough 
classifier model in front of the model. First, reducing 
attribute, removing redundant attributes, then mining 
association rules, finally propose the logistic regression 
(shown in Figure 1), solved the defects of attribute 
redundancy and too many rules that cause by confidence 
framework. 
The aim of this paper is to studying the complex 
factors such as environment, health status, customs and 
medical history in ethnic minority areas in northwest. 
Finally we found the significant factors of cerebral 
infarction are other brain disease history, alcohol 
consumption and seasonal variation.

II. MODEL APPLICATION: ASSOCIATION RULE 
MINING IN CEREBRAL lNFRACTION 
We integrate the rough collection (Rough Sets) model, 
the association rules, the Apriori algorithm and the 
logistic regression model together called RAL(Rough­
Apriori-Logistic) model. Then we studied the relations 
between cerebral infarction patient in the northwest 
national minority areas with environment, custom, the 
state of health and the medical history, taken the Inner 
Mongolian Huhhot first hospital patients as the case. The 
aim is to discover the key factors to prevent the cerebral 
infraction. 
The research team has collected 128 patient data from 
the Inner Mongolian Huhhot first hospital. The data 
attribute including age, sex, nationality, work, marital 
condition and so on. We choused the partial samples from 
cerebral infarction medical records to establish cerebral 
infarction symptom information table. 
We use D to denotes the cerebral infarction patient; a 
denotes sm (losing sleep); b denotes ty (dizziness); c 
denotes tt (headache); d denotes em (tinnitus); e denotes 
tlxj (hearing drop); f denotes qd(pants); g denotes ztwl 
(body incapable); h denotes swbq(regards thing not clear); 
i denotes bsbs(paralyzed); j denotes ztmm (body numb); 
k denotes yybl (language disadvantageous); 1 denotes fycd 
(slow reaction); m denotes ffot (repeatedly vomit); n 
denotes jltt (fierce ache); 0 denotes szbq (unconscious); p 
denotes ebsj (two then incontinence). Cerebral infarction 
symptom information decision-making table system S= 
(U, R, V, F), the attribute set is R= Q U T , Q is the 
condition attribute, Q= (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, 1, m, n, 
0, p), decision attribute T= (t).

The first step, the cerebral infarction data symptom 
information decision-making table has been established, 
The second step, the Discernibility matrix has been 
established, 
The third step, let Lij = v ai

We did the mining on the rule of min-support 0.25, 
min-confidence 0.9, obtained the following results: 
Has other blood vessel of brain medical history ==> 
cerebral infarction 
Married, has other blood vessel of brain medical 
history ==> cerebral infarction 
Sex male, has other blood vessel of brain medical 
history ==> cerebral infarction 
Sex male, the breath not normal, has other blood 
vessel of brain medical history => cerebral infarction 
Age> 61, have other blood vessel of brain medical 
history, not to smoke ==> cerebral infarction 
Sex male, married, has other blood vessel of brain 
medical history => cerebral infarction 
Has other blood vessel of brain medical history, non­
surgery flesh wound history ==> cerebral infarction 
305 
Has hypertension => in the first quarter; Cerebral 
infarction institution work, non-saccharorrhea medical 
history, pulse number of times normal => Cerebral 
infarction 
Age> 61, sexes male, first quarter, non-saccharorrhea 
medical history ==> Cerebral infarction 
We got the flowing rules after we let the confidence 
level down from 0.9 to 0.85. 
Has saccharorrhea medical history ==> cerebral 
infarction 
Married, has saccharorrhea medical history ==> 
cerebral infarction has saccharorrhea medical history, 
breath not normal ==> cerebral infarction 
Drinks => cerebral infarction 
Drinks, married ==> cerebral infarction 
Drinks, breath abnormal ==> cerebral infarction 
III. LOGISTIC REGRESSION OF CEREBRAL INFARCTION 
INFLUENCE FACTOR 
The forward association rules mining have had many 
rules. We used the logistic regression model to carry on 
the significance examination of factors that affect cerebral 
infarction and obtained the results. 
According to the association rules mining results we 
got that the influence factors including other blood 
vessel of brain medical history, sex, marital condition, 
age, work, smoking, drink, quarter, diabetes history and 
so on. The regression model is: 
exp( R +px +p x + ... + R X) P( cerebral inf arction ) = P o " 2 2 Pm m 
1 + exp(Po + p,X, + P2XZ + ... + PmXm) 
X),X2, ... ,Xm are the influence factors. 
The dependent variable is the cerebral infarction, the 
independent variables are other blood vessel of brain 
medical history, sex, marital condition, age, work, 
smoking, drink, quarter, diabetes history and so on. The 
regression result has been showed in the flowing table1. 
we can find that the significant influence factors are 
quarter, other blood vessel of brain medical history, drink 
and so on. Simultaneously we carried on the correlation 
analysis to factors, discovered that they don't have the 
significant co relational dependence between the primary 
factors.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
By the RAL model analysis, we got the following 
conclusions, 
(1) Having other blood vessel of brain medical history 
is a remarkable factor. That is if someone who has other 
blood vessel brain medical history are easier to get the 
cerebral infarction than others. 
(2)Although the cerebral infarction often occurs but 
often forms the morbidity peak in the seasonal variation. 
For example: temperature, barometric pressure, humidity 
are fierce Change, therefore forms two small peaks in one 
year, that is spring with winter and fall with winter, we 
discovered that the third, fourth quarter is the cerebral 
infarction's incidence, especially the patients with 
hypertension should pay more attention to the seasonal 
variation. They should drink more water and wear more 
clothes. 
(3) The 5% are the significance level judgment 
standards. The non-significance factors of cerebral 
infarction include, age, sex, national, work, marital 
condition, saccharorrhea medical history, liver medical 
history, tuberculosis medical history, kidney medical 
history and brothers and sisters medical history and 
306 
surgery history, smoking, diastolic pressure, wine, uric 
acid, carbon dioxide, potassium ion, sodium ion, chloride 
ion and so on. 
(4) The research indicated that drinking is an important 
independent hazard factor of cerebral infraction, while 
nationality is a correlation factor, not an independent 
restrictive factor, this is different from former study 
conclusion. 
(5) In the RAL model ,we used rough collection analysis, 
deductd the complex related attribute, not only enhance 
the analysis quality but also improve the efficiency 
compare with not establish the rough collection analysis 
model (see literature [10] and [11]) . The efficiency has 
been enhanced 3.2 times.
