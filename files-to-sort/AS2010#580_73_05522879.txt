I. INTRODUCTION 
Status monitor and diagnosis techniques are used by 
CBM to obtain the state of equipments and fault informa-
tion, judge the device exception, forecast the development 
tendency of fault, and decide to repair the equipments be-
fore the occurrence happens [1]. At present, internal condi-
tion-based maintenance is at a stalemate that making the 
maintenance decision in accordance with the condition 
monitoring and fault diagnosis of equipments. 
With the rapid development of power industrial and 
investment of various monitoring equipments, the data in 
power system database is exploding by the explosive in-
crease of information technology, which makes it imposs-
ible to distinguish the supporting information for deci-
sion-making hidden in the database. Besides, traditional 
query and reporting tool are unable to meet the informa-
tion needs of mining. It is imperative to introduce data 
mining technology into the analysis of power system. The 
combination of condition-based maintenance technology 
and data mining is also a general trend [2-3]. 
The paper mainly researches assistant decision system 
of the electric power equipment CBM. The application 
research of data dig in the electric power equipment CBM 
also has been detailed analyzed. The system adopts the 
Condition-Based Maintenance technology based on data 
mining, combines the monitoring data of device and stu-
dies its database, such as analyzing and classifying the 
state characteristic quantities of devices. The system also 
reveals the deep information hidden in it and rule of gra-
dient performance, discovers the early warning signs of 
the potential defects, uses fuzzy theory in order to make a 
judgment for serious degrees and development trends of 
the faults, and provides decision support. 
II. THE STRUCTURE OF SYSTEM 
Data mining is the process of abstracting unaware, po-
tential and useful information and knowledge from plenti-
ful, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and stochastic data. Data 
mining is a popular technology supporting for DSS, which 
is mainly based on statistics, computer science, pattern 
recognition, artificial intelligence and machine learning. It 
will make inductive reasoning and obtain the pattern of 
relationships between data objects by analyzing and deal-
ing with initial data highly automatically. Those patterns 
of relationships reflect the inherent characteristics of data, 
which is the higher abstraction level of the information 
included in the data. 
The decision support system based on data mining 
combines the traditional DSS and data mining organically, 
and extracts useful data and discovers useful knowledge 
effectively from the large data. The structure of the assis-

 tant decision system in the article reflects the integrated 
application of a variety of data mining methods [1, 3-5]. 
A. Data pretreatment  
The data source of this project includes basic technical 
data, operation data, and maintenance data. Basic technical 
data includes: drawings, specifications, Ex-factory data, 
installation data and so on. The operation data includes: 
operating conditions, defects records, accident records, 
daily inspection records, online monitoring data, infrared 
monitoring data, and environmental conditions data. The 
maintenance data includes: preventive test data, overhaul 
and minor repairs records, flaw treatment records, accident 
treatment records, similar equipment accidents or defects 
and treatment experience and so on. 
Not all parameters of power transformer equipments 
should be stored in the system to avoid wasting because of 
the mammoth database and uneasy management. We just 
need to store the state parameters intimately related to the 
operating condition of power transformer equipments. 
These state parameters should be set through national 
standards and data mining methods such as the association 
rules and so on. 
The data needed in the system is divided into three 
types: high-pressure test data, oil test data and operation 
data. Data encoding and data store of the test data in this 
article has been built, which lay a solid foundation for 
processing, analyzing and making use of the data. 
B. Fuzzy processing[6] 
Fuzziness usually means the uncertainty of the defini-
tion of the concept and the understanding of linguistic 
meaning, for example, the uncertainty included in the 
“normal state” and “dubious state” of power transformer 
equipments is fuzziness. Fuzziness provides a man-made 
compromise between qualitative and quantitative, subjec-
tive and objective, ambiguity and clarity. It can be used to 
study the state of power transformer equipments. 
The fuzzy processing of electrical test data focuses on 
the processing of preventative test data of power transfor-
mer equipments, this includes: high-pressure test data on 
ontology, Casing high-pressure test data and oil test data 
on ontology of power transformer equipments. There is 
the fuzziness and uncertainty of the cause and phenomena 
of the malfunction and failure mechanism of power trans-
former equipments; it is difficult to describe the relation-
ship between them using a simple diagnostic method, 
though it is very hard to diagnose the cause of the mal-
function and the real fault conditions. The fuzzy mathe-
matics in this article analyzes quantitatively the obscure 
phenomenon of power transformer equipments combined 
with fuzzy language. The method is composed of the fol-
lowing steps: 
1) Construction of reviews sets of power transformer 
equipments 
The four states “normal”, “attention”, “abnormal” and 
“serious” will be set as the reviews sets of power trans-
former equipment. 
2) Construction of factor sets of evaluation object of 
power transformer equipments 
All kinds of operation condition of power transformer 
equipments are set as the evaluation factors of the fuzzy 
evaluation. Such as: insulation resistance, absorption, po-
larization and index and so on. 
3) Determination of membership function 
Membership function in fuzzy sets range in [0, 1], 
therefore, the concept of relative deterioration degree is 
introduced to represent the degree of relative deterioration 
of the actual status compares to the fault condition.  
For the state variables which are the smaller the better 
such as dielectric Loss, the relative deterioration degree 
can be expressed as: 
max
max1)(
c
ccxf i ??=  
ic  is the actual value, maxc is the maximum value 
when the equipment has a fault. 
For the state variables which are the bigger the better 
such as polarization index, the relative deterioration de-
gree can be expressed as: 
min
min1)(
c
ccxf i??=  
minc  is the attention value or the alert level of the 
equipment state parameters. 
For the state variables which are the type of deviation 
such as capacitance, the relative deterioration degree can 
be expressed as: 
373
 mav
mavi
c
cc
xf
?
?= 1)(  
mavc  is the attention value of capacitance. 
The quantitative data of all kinds of state variables are 
used by fuzzy distribution method in this article. The tri-
angular membership function is simple in structure, and its 
result is nearly same with other more complex member-
ship functions’. Therefore, the membership function “tri-
angular and semi-trapezoidal combination” is adopt to 
establish the various membership function correspond to 
the different state levels. As shown in Figure 1.

C. processing of historical data  
1) Vertical comparison of test data of power 
transformer equipments  
In order to ensure the credibility of the significant dif-
ference analysis, two conditions should be required: 
a) 6 or more sets of equipments, belong to the same 
type and the same batch, or are uniform in design, 
craftsmanship and materials, and the previous test data 
does not differ greatly. 
b) under the same experimental conditions, the same 
test is the best. 
The analysis method of significant difference betw
een the amounts of the state is as follows: 
Set n (n ? 5) devices in the same family (the same 
batch and the same manufacturer).The average of the cur-
rent experimental values for a state X is x. The sample 
bias is S (diagnostic equipment are not included). The 
current test value of diagnostic equipment is x, then the 
conditions of significant difference is:  
The degradation shows in decline of status value (In-
sulation resistance): 
ksxx ?<  
The degradation shows in increase of status value (Di-
electric loss): 
ksxx +>  
The degradation shows in deviate from the initial value 
(Capacitance): 
),( ksxksxx +??  
k in the formulas above are selected according to n,

2) Horizontal comparison of test data of power 
transformer equipment  
The application conditions are: there is a group of de-
vices A, B and C, such as circuit breaker, isolating switch, 
etc. There are also at least two tests of the value including 
the current test value, which were recorded as a1, b1, c1 
(the last test value) and a2, b2, c2 (the experimental val-
ues). If we want to analyze whether the experimental val-
ues of A is normal, the value of F can be calculated ac-
cording to equation (1). It is abnormal if F>=0.3.

D. The overall structure of the system 
 The deducted points of the substation equipments 
state are decided by its weight coefficient and the degree 
of degradation. The state of power transformer equipments 
should be determined by its deducted points. In order to 
meet the need of worksite and judge the status of power 
transformer equipments accurately for the staff of electric 
power test, fuzzy mathematics method is used to process 
the test data. At the same time, fuzzy three-ratio method is 
also used on the dissolved gas in oil for the fault diagnosis 
374
 for power transformer equipments. The specific processes 
as shown in figure 2.

III. ANALYSIS OF SYSTEM OPERATION RESULTS 
The basic technical data, operation data, and mainten-
ance data obtained from the Management Information 
System (MIS) database are sort out in the system. Part of 
the test data of power transformer equipment are treated 
comprehensively. Operating parameter data’s points will 
be deducted according to the condition-based maintenance 
guidelines carried out by the state power grid in 2008. 
Finally, the equipment status assessment report is gener-
ated as shown in figure 3 and the corresponding sugges-
tions and cycle of condition-based maintenance are put 
forward. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The fairly deep power system-related knowledge and 
theoretical guidance are called for in the data mining 
process in power system, which enable data mining more 
efficient through combining the DSS and data mining or-
ganically[5]. This system classify and analyze the data us-
ing correlation method of data mining, assess the status of 
power transformer equipments properly and give a rea-
sonable maintenance plan. This system had been applied 
and had played an important role in the company's condi-
tion-based maintenance.
