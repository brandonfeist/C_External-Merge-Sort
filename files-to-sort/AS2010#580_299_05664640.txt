Abstract 
An e-Government portal is responsible to provide 
news, information and services to citizens, merchants 
and tourists in a reliable way. Previously, we 
proposed a Web Monitoring System (WMS) that 
monitors the performance of a web portal in real-
time [1]. Web portal structure is complex to analyze 
though it is important to discover useful patterns, 
evaluate performance, locate anomalies and identify 
problems. Visualization is helpful in performance 
evaluation and interpretation of web usage mining 
results. In this paper we proposed a tool comprised 
of visualization and fuzzy association rule mining, 
called Web Visualization System (WEBVS), as an 
extension to the WMS for monitoring and analyzing 
performances of e-Government websites. 
1. Introduction 
In the past decades, the rapid growth of ICT has 
driven governments to digitalize documents, provide 
information and implement online services in many 
countries. On the other hand, such use of ICT has 
increased pressure on governments to improve 
performance and achieve “a better government”. 
According to [2], as governments are developing 
more and more electronic services, they are also 
coming to the realization that they often do not know 
what kind of e-government citizens want. ICT tools 
have provided governments with new ways to 
provide information and to consult with citizens, but 
determining the preferences of citizens and 
businesses with regard to the structure and content of 
electronic services rests a true challenge. Many 
people would hard-pressed to be able to articulate 
their expectations of government, even with a full 
understanding of the technological possibilities. 
The target users of an e-Government portal are 
usually in three groups: citizens, merchants and 
tourists. Their needs and preferences can be very 
different. Taking care of them effectively and 
reliably is the main objective of an e-Government 
portal. It is necessary to ensure the information and 
online services are delivered accurately, effectively 
and efficiently to these three groups of users, hence 
meeting their expectations and preferences. In [1], 
we proposed a WMS to constantly monitor the e- 
Government portal in real-time. The results of WMS 
however come only in the forms of statistics and 
performance reports. In this paper, we propose to use 
WEBVS to visualize the results of WMS by showing 
the discovered patterns and performance statistics 
and superimpose them over the website structure in a 
social network. Presentation of such information with 
colors and thickness of nodes and edges is easier to 
understand, interpret and locate anomalies or 
interesting phenomenon than lists of statistics and 
numbers report. We believe such a visualization tool 
will assist the site administrators and analysts in 
decision making, maintenance and analysis. In 
addition to the visual graphs, WEBVS also outputs 
association rules of the web access data obtained 
from web logs. The association rules reveal the 
relations between pages (services) visited and the 
visitor’s browsing behavior. In Section 2, we discuss 
related web visualization works. Section 3 tells that 
how our WEBVS relates to the WMS. Our WEBVS 
web visualization is discussed in Section 4 showing 
the result graphs and describing the features and 
functions. Section 5 comes the generation and 
technique of the Fuzzy Apriori Association Rules we 
use in WEBVS. Finally we draw a conclusion in 
Section 6. 
2. Related Work 
In the past decade, researchers have been 
exploring visualization methods for understanding 
the activities that happen over websites. [6]. Recent 
researches focus on the interactive visualization of 
the web usage data. However, we have not found any 
interactive tool or application developed specially for 
visualizing and analyzing web access and usage in an 
e-Government portal.

The authors in [3] introduced different 2D and 3D 
visualization diagrams of particular interest, 
classifying web pages into two classes of hot (with
many hits) and cold (with few hits) ones and 
illustrating behavior of users. The framework enables 
flexible selection of mappings between data 
attributes and visualization dimensions for different 
diagrams. In the case of large scale portal like an e-
Government, however, 3D diagrams will be too 
dense to interpret. 
In [4], the Web Knowledge Visualization and 
Discovery System (WEBKVDS) is mainly composed 
of two parts: a) FootPath: for visualizing the web 
structure with the different data and pattern layers; b) 
Web Graph Algebra: for manipulating and operating 
on the web graph objects for visual data mining. The 
authors presented the idea of layering data and 
patterns in distinct layers on top of a disktree 
representation of the web structure, allowing the 
display of information in context which is more 
suited for the interpretation of discovered patterns. 
And with the help of the web graph algebra, the 
system provides a means for interactive visual web 
mining. 
WebViz system, a tool to visualize both the 
structure and usage of web sites, is proposed in [5]. 
The structure of a web segment is rendered as a 
radial tree, and usage data is extracted and layered as 
polygonal graphs. By interactively creating and 
adjusting these layers, a user can develop real time 
insight into the data. The system shows the idea of
interactive visual operators and the idea of a polygon 
graph as a visual cue. The polygonal graphs, 
however, are not straight forward enough and it 
needs time to interpret to discover useful 
information. 
3. Proposed Solution 
The analytic results from the four modules in 
WMS together with the web structure are imported to
the WEBVS for visualization. The web structure is 
rendered as a radial tree and the analytic results will 
be overlaid on it by some visual cues. Web 
administrations and analysts can select different data 
attributes and thresholds to visualize. The web 
graphs rendered by the WEBVS give the idea of how 
an e-Gov portal is doing. Such presentation of the 
portal status is easier to understand and locate 
anomalies or interesting phenomenon than just lists
of numbers in a report. Together with the 
performance reports generated by the WMS, the site 
administrations and analysts should be able to know
the operating status and performance of the portal at 
a glance. An overview of WEBVS in relation to 
WMS is shown in Figure 1.  
Figure 1. Web-based Visualization System 
In figure 2, performance data and web pages 
information are input to the Integration Engine [3]
for data preparation i.e. extracting, cleaning, 
transforming, integrating data and finally loading into 
database and later generating XGML for interactive 
2D visualization. There are two graph views with 
analytic results mapping on a web structure radial 
tree in WEBVS: static graph view visualizes the web
page information which only have changes after 
updates, e.g. the HTML file size, content type, 
number of words and links in a page, etc.; dynamic 
graph view visualizes the web performance statistics 
which is generated by the WMS and changes from 
time to time, e.g. page views, active time, bounce 
rate, number of clicks and visitors, etc. WEBVS 
enables the web administrations and analysts to view 
both graphs together and select their preferred visual 
cues for finding interesting patterns. The Fuzzy Sets 
Generator normalizes the active times on a page for
each page view and creates the fuzzy sets for finding 
association rules. 
4. Visualizing e-Government Portal 
Definitions of e-government vary in its: 
• “The use of information technology to free 
movement of information to overcome the physical 
bounds of traditional paper and physical based 
systems” [7] 
• “The use of technology to enhance the access to 
and delivery of government services to benefit 
citizens, business partners and employees.” [8] 
The common theme behind these definitions is 
that e-government involves the automation or 
computerization of existing paper-based procedures 
that will prompt new styles of leadership, new ways
of debating and deciding strategies, new ways of 
transacting business, new ways of listening to 
citizens and communities, and new ways of 
organizing and delivering information [9].

4.1. Input Data and Assumptions 
In addition to the analytic results from the WMS, 
web structure should be prepared and imported into 
WEBVS for visualization. Figure 3 shows the input 
data for the static graph visualization in XGML. 
Moreover, to discover the preferences and needs of 
the citizens, merchants and visitors, we have to 
identify what are their hot pages and what these hot 
pages are about. Hot pages in [3] are those pages 
with many hits. The number of hits received by a 
website is frequently cited to assert its popularity, but 
this number is extremely misleading. Therefore, our
WEBVS measures the hot and cold pages by active 
time, which is the average amount of time that 
visitors spend on each page of the site. The web 
pages are classified into several content groups 
according to their keywords, for examples: news, 
information, media, e-services, etc. Then we measure 
their popularities as hot or cold pages. 
Figure 3. Input data for static view in XGML 
format
Visualizing such access data, our WEBVS can help 
the web administrations easily identify what content a 
merchant needs and what content should be 
translated into a language. 
4.2. Web Graphs 
In figure 4, WEBVS visualizes the web 
information in Static view and performance data in 
Dynamic view. For both static and dynamic views, 
there is an expandable control panel providing 
options to configure the mapping between data 
attributes and visual cues. The static graph view 
provides the page information in complement to the 
dynamic web access graph for web administrations 
and analysts to figure out the anomalies occurring in 
the web portal in a more efficient way. 
The web structure is visualized as radial tree [10]. 
In the radial tree layout a single node is placed at the 
center of the display and all the other nodes are laid 
around it. The entire graph is like a tree rooted at the 
central node. The central node is referred to as the 
focus node and all the other nodes are arranged on 
concentric rings around it. Each node lies on the ring 
corresponding to its shortest network distance from
the focus. Any pair of nodes joined by an edge in the 
graph is referred to as neighbors. Immediate 
neighbors of the focus lie on the smallest inner ring, 
their neighbors lie on the second smallest ring, and so 
on. Radial tree layout is suitable for dynamically 
changing graphs since the addition or deletion of a
node perturbs its siblings only by a small amount, 
especially as the graph becomes dense. In WEBVS, 
the focus node can be switched around by simply 
clicking at one of the other nodes. 
In figure 5, nodes are colored by content type, i.e. 
green nodes represent pages with media content and 
red nodes are downloads, while larger nodes indicate 
317
that the pages have larger file size meaning the page 
contains more content. This graph, when compared 
with the dynamic graph with node size representing 
active time in dynamic view, can clearly show if 
visitors spend more time on a web page with more 
content. If not, the page is having low performance
and the web administrator must find out the reason 
and take action to improve, maybe by adding a link 
in a related hot page. 
Figure 6 is a visualization of web structure as a 
radial tree showing what the hot pages are in the 
dynamic graph view. The green nodes are those 
pages with active time above the threshold set by the 
site administrator. They are the hot pages on which
users spend most time in browsing and interacting 
actively with the content. The thickness of the edge 
shows the usage traffic. Site administrator or analyst 
can select usage data of users from one country or 
one user group to visualize. The analytic results from 
the web log analysis module on WMS contribute to 
this function. Actually, with the results from WMS,
WEBVS can visualize various web graphs of 
particular interest. A site administrator can 
interactively find out where broken links exist if any, 
where page load time is higher than an acceptable 
range, and other phenomena of interest. 
There are various indicators of a website that can 
be shown in the static and dynamic views in our 
WEBVS with different visual cues. It will have a 
more readable, meaningful and interesting web graph
when quantitative indicator relating to size represents 
with node size and categorical or unevenly 
distributed indicator represents with node color. 
Table 1 shows a typical mapping we found in 
WEBVS.

5. Fuzzy Apriori Association Rules 
Association rule discovery techniques are 
generally applied to databases of transactions where 
each transaction consists of a set of items. The goal is 
to discover all associations and correlations among
data items where the presence of one set of items in a 
transaction implies (with a certain degree of 
confidence) the presence of other items. In the 
context of Web usage mining, it is used to discover
the correlations among references to various pages 
available on the server by a given client. Each 
transaction is comprised of a set of URLs accessed 
by a visitor [12]. Conventional Association Rule 
Mining (ARM) algorithms usually deal with 
datasets with categorical values and expect any 
numerical values to be converted to categorical ones 
using ranges. In real life, data is neither only 
categorical nor only numerical but a combination of
both. And the general method adopted is to convert 
numerical attributes into categorical attributes using 
ranges. The problem with the above approach to 
dividing ranged values into sub-ranges is that the 
boundaries between the sub-ranges are crisp 
boundaries. Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM) 
is intended to address the crisp boundary problem 
encountered in traditional ARM. The principal idea 
is that ranged values can belong to more than one 
sub-ranges is that the boundaries between the sub-
ranges are crisp boundaries. Fuzzy Association Rule
Mining (FARM) is intended to address the crisp 
boundary problem encountered in traditional ARM. 
The principal idea is that ranged values can belong to 
more than one sub-ranges , we say that the value has 
a membership degree, µ, that associates it with each 
available sub-ranges. For example, we define three 
age categories: Young, Middle-aged and Old, and 
then ascertain the fuzzy membership (range [0, 1]) of 
each crisp numerical value in these categories. Thus, 
Age = 35 may have µ = 0.6 for the fuzzy partition 
Middle-aged, µ = 0.3 for Young and µ = 0.1 for 
Old.[11] Thus, by using fuzzy partitions, we preserve 
the information encapsulated in the numerical 
attribute, and are also able to convert it to a 
categorical attribute, albeit a fuzzy one. Therefore, 
many fuzzy sets can be defined on the domain of 
each quantitative attribute, and the original dataset is 
transformed into an extended one with attribute 
values having fuzzy memberships in the interval [0,
1]. 
To measure the success or popularity of a page, as 
we discuss earlier, we use the active time instead of 
number of hits. When a visitor browses through the 
internet, he/she will stay longer in pages that have 
updated, useful and attractive content. In web log 
files, we can find out the web usage data of a visitor 
telling us where he/she locates, what pages viewed 
and the active time spent on a page. We have no 
problem in defining the locations of the visitors into 
categories of countries or regions. However, to 
discover what content they are interested in from a
set of pages, we can only measure the length of the
active time. In this case, we define the categories as 
content groups of the pages which are the same as we 
have defined earlier for the static view web graph, i.e. 
News, Information, Download, Media and e-Service. 
Then normalize the active time on a page into the 
interval [0, 1] by decimal scaling normalization to
generate the membership degree of the categorical 
attribute. 
As in classical association rules, I={i1 , i2 , ... , im } 
represents all the attributes appearing in the 
transaction database T={ i1 , i2 , ... , in } . I contains 
all the possible items of a database, different 
combinations of those items are called itemsets. Each 
attribute ik will associate with several fuzzy sets. In 
order to represent the fuzzy sets associated with ik , 
we use the notion: 
, where is the jth
fuzzy set. 
Therefore, we have the attribute Page as follows: 
FPage = { News, Information, Download, Media, e-
Service } and obtain a fuzzy database as in Table 2. 
319
Table 2. Sample fuzzy database
After setting the support and confident, perform 
Fuzzy Apriori algorithm and get interesting rules as 
shown in Figure 7. We can see that visitors who 
spent longer time on pages with the content of media 
and download are from Macau.

6. Conclusion 
The information and online services of an e-
Government portal should be delivered accurately, 
effectively and efficiently to different groups of users 
to meet their expectations and preferences. Knowing
the needs and preferences of users is very important. 
For this purpose, WEBVS is proposed to visualize 
the analytic and performance results of WMS 
together with web page information in web graphs 
and generate interesting and meaningful association
rules. Such web graphs and association rules help the 
web administrator to discover and locate where 
anomalies or interesting phenomenon are and, hence,
take actions to improve the portal when necessary, 
for providing a successful e-Government portal.
