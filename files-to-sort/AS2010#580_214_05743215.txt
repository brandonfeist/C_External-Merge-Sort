Abstract—At present, detecting customs declaration frauds 
with limited examination of imported goods by available scarce 
resources is posing considerable challenge to the customs 
authorities world over. Data mining techniques  could be 
utilized to sift through the past data and develop predictive 
model for examination of limited goods with higher probability 
of fraud. This paper puts forward a classification data mining 
method based on association rules. Following the analysis on 
customs inspection results and the exploration on the 
regularity of “non-consistent between customs declaration and 
actual commodity” by use of data mining based on association 
rules, a classification model is established to predict the risk of 
commodity through customs clearance and form the reference 
for customs inspection and monitoring.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Customs is a main body of a country to administrate the 
action of importing or exporting commodity and to collect 
the duties. The customs clearance efficiency and service 
level not only affects the trade efficiency, but also creates 
great impact on the investment, employment and even 
regional economic development. With the rapid development 
of world economy and international trade, various tariffs and 
non-tariff measures have been removed gradually and 
business volume of customs has increased substantially. The 
rapid growth in business volume makes customs be short of 
administration resources. On the other hand, with the rapid 
development of economy and trade, the domestic and 
international markets are integrated gradually and advanced 
modern enterprise management concept puts forward higher 
requirements on the efficiency of customs clearance, i.e. 
modern enterprises request customs to speed up customs 
clearance. Along with the rapid development of customs 
information technology, customs database has collected vast 
customs revenue management data especially since H2000 
customs administration system and risk management 
platform are implemented in all customs of China. These 
business data cover all the fields in customs administration 
and present the features of large amount, rapid growth and 
complex relationship. Hence, data mining at in-depth level 
on vast customs business data are required to identify the 
regularity and mode based on the analysis of customs 
administration demands and port status analysis to help 
customs staffs make better use of the potential knowledge to 
put forward monitoring proposals according to actual 
conditions. 
This paper puts forward a classification data mining 
method based on association rules. Following the analysis on 
historical customs inspection results, the regularity of 
“inconsistent between customs declaration and actual 
commodity” is explored by use of data mining based on 
association rules, and a classification model is established on 
the basis of these regularities to predict the risks of 
commodity clearance and form the reference for customs 
inspection and monitoring and improve the seizure rate in the 
end. The contents of this paper are as follows: The second 
section is the related study on current risk analysis 
techniques for customs. The third section introduces how to 
establish a classification model based on association rules 
including association rules mining and classification model 
generated by association rules. In the fourth section, the 
experiment and the related analysis are made. The fifth 
section is the summary. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Association rules and classification are two important 
data mining technology[2]. The target of classification is to 
establish an accurate classification model to predict the 
unknown category of data objectives. Presently, many 
classification methods are based on heuristic search 
technology, such as the Decision Tree algorithm, Bayes 
network and some statistical methods. Association rules are 
proposed by Agrawal etc[1]. And association rule mining is 
to identify the data to meet pre-specified frequency and 
accuracy threshold. The major problem of data mining by 
use of association rules is how to select the interesting rule 
particularly from the rules found. Association rule mining 
has no pre-determined objectives, and if the frequency 
threshold is too low, so there may be many frequent itemsets 
resulting in many rules. For these rules, some are 
unremarkable for users but some are very interesting. 
For data mining, the search for association rules is just 
the start work. The collection of association rules does not 
present single overall model for systematic ratiocination, but 
a series of simple models, which can be used to form global

data model. The association rules and classification model 
can be combined to form a list of decision-making or rule 
collection and create a new classification based on 
association rules so as to solve classification problems. 
Classification model using simple rules can be traced back to 
1R (or OneR) [8]classification algorithm appeared in 1993. 
In 1998, Bing Liu presented classification algorithm based 
on association(CBA)[4]. This algorithm uses Apriori 
algorithm to generate classification rules. Afterwards, Han J 
presented CMAR algorithm using the deformation of FP-
growth method, which is more effective with scalability and 
higher average accuracy compared with classification 
algorithm based on association (CBA) presented by Bing Liu. 
These methods are to integrate data mining and classification 
to achieve higher classification accuracy than that of 
traditional classification methods (e.g. C4.5). 
III. CLASSIFICATION MODEL BASED ON ASSOCIATION 
RULES 
A. Basic Concepts 
The establishment of classification model based on 
association rules includes categorical association rules 
mining and the processing on the obtained association rules 
by using a heuristic method in order to structure the 
classification. Category Association Rules (CARs) are a kind 
of special rule collection, and the rule consequents are fixed 
the attribute of classifications. 
Let I={i1,i2,…,im} be a collection of items, one of the 
elements ij(j=1,2,…,m) is denoted as (item), C={c1,c2,…,ck} 
is a collection of classification labels, a category of 
association rules is a containing type in form of X?Y (X?I, 
Y?C). D is denoted as the collection of transaction T, which 
is an itemset of Ij that contains ck (Ij?I, ck?C). Set X is a 
collection of middle items in I, if X?T, then transaction T 
contains X. 
The support of association rules X?Y in the transaction 
database D is a ratio between the transactions containing X 
and Y and all transactions, and the probability of X and Y 
occurred simultaneously in all transactions to be 
support(X?Y). That is support(X?Y)=|{T: X?Y?T, T?D }| 
/|D|. The confidence of association rules X?Y in the 
transaction set is the percentage of D containing X and Y 
transactions. This is taken to be conditional probability, 
P(Y|X), to be confidence(X?Y). That is confidence (X?Y) = 
P(Y|X). 
Rules of support and confidence are two interest 
measures. They are found in the rules to reflect the 
usefulness and certainty. Association rules are considered 
interesting if they satisfy the minimum support thresholds 
and minimum confidence thresholds. The rule to satisfy the 
minimum support thresholds and minimum confidence 
thresholds simultaneously is called a strong rule. Given a 
transaction set D, our goal is to generate all of the CARs sets 
according to the given minimum support minsup and 
minimum confidence threshold minconf and then build a 
classifier according to the generated CARs. 
B. Generated Association Rules 
Association rule mining process is generally divided into 
two sub-issues: a) find all the support is greater than the 
minimum support of itemsets, these itemsets are called 
frequent itemsets; b) use step 1 to find the rules of frequent 
itemsets to generate the desired value. The first step, 
"frequent itemsets production" is the most critical. 
1) Frequent Itemset Mining 
Apriori is one of most influential algorithm for mining 
frequent itemsets for association rules. Apriori employs an 
iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where k-
itemssets are used to explore (k+1)-itemsets. First, the set of 
frequent 1-itemsets is found. This set is denoted L1, then L1 
is used to find L2, the set pf frequent 2-itemsets, which is 
used to find L3, and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets 
can be found. The finding of each Lk requires one full scan 
of the database.

used to find L3, and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets 
can be found. The finding of each Lk requires one full scan 
of the database. 
To improve the efficiency of the level-wise generation of 
frequent itemsets, an important property called the Apriori 
property. Any non-frequent (k-1)-itemsets can not be subset 
of frequent k-itemsets to determine whether the candidate 
item in set is frequent. If the (k-1)- subset of a candidate k-
itemsets is not in frequent (k-1)-itemsets, then the candidate 
subset can not be frequent, which can be deleted from k-
itemsets. Therefore, the number of candidate itemsets can be 
reduced in a certain degree, the search space on frequent 
itemsets can be deducted effectively, and the number of 
support calculation can be decreased. 
A two-step iterative process from frequent (k-1)-itemsets 
to frequent k-itemsets is followed, consisting of join and 
prune actions: 
a) The join step: a set of candidate k-itemsets is 
generated by joining (k-1)-itemsets with itself. 
b) The prune step: frequent k- itemsets is determined 
by candidate k-itemsets by use of Apriori property to 
compress candidate k-itemsets. 
2) Association Rules Generated by Frequent Itemset 
Frequent itemsets to satisfy the minimum confidence 
constitute the collection of CARs based on association rules, 
and the generated algorithm is as follows: 
/ * association rules algorithm generated by frequent itemset * /  
Input: all the frequent itemsets and minimum confidence 
minconf. 
Output: categorical association rules, CARs 
begin 
(1)  The category attribute values are denoted as the 
consequent of the rules (category attribute: Y), and the 
437
  
combination of remaining attribute values as the antecedent 
of the rules to generate the rules. 
(2) Calculate the confidence of every rule confidence 
(X?Y) =P(Y|X)=support(X?Y)/ support(X), 
Among them, support(X?Y) is the transactions record 
number of X?Y itemset, and support(X) is the transactions 
record number of X, 
If confidence(X?Y)>minconf is to retain the rule, or 
delete the rule.  
(3) If a certain set of association rule is lack in 
categorical association rules (CARs), the minimum 
confidence minconf is adjusted automatically to the 
maximum in this rule, and then execute 2 again. 
end 
C. Classification Model Establishment Based on 
Association Rules 
In order to build the best classifier on the obtained rules, 
the rules with the least errors are selected. Set R to be all of 
the generated rules and D is the training data. The basic 
purpose of the algorithm is to select some rules of relatively 
higher priority from R to replace D. Hereby, priority here is 
defined as: two rules are given, ri and rj as well as ri; rj (i.e. 
the priority of ri is higher than that of rj), must satisfy one of 
the following conditions: 
• if the confidence of ri is higher than that of rj 
• the confidence of ri and rj is the same, but the 
support of ri is higher than that of rj 
• both the confidence and support of ri and rj are the 
same, but the generated time of ri is earlier that that 
of (namely the former of rules has fewer attributes) 
The form of classifier is established as follows: < r1, r2,…, 
rn, default_class>, Hereby, rj?R, if b>a, then ra ; rb, 
default_class is the default classification. In the classification 
of an unknown transaction, the first to meet this rule can be 
classified into this transaction. If not, this transaction is 
classified as the default classification. 
The establishment of classifier consists of three steps as 
follows: 
• Arrange all the rules of R in descending order 
according to relations. This ensures that the classifier 
can select the rules with the highest priority. 
• For each rule r?R, the cases can be selected in D to 
replace r (i.e. they satisfy the former attribute values 
of rule r). If r can be classified correctly at least, r 
can replace a transaction, and it is a potential rule of 
the classifier. For those transactions that can be 
classified, they are moved away from D. For the 
transactions in D that can not be replaced by rule r, 
default_class is marked. And then the quantity of 
transactions classified by the classifier and default 
classification category. Hereby, default_class refers 
to the classification attributed by the majority of 
transactions remained in D.  
• Abandon the rules not to improve the classifier 
accuracy, and the classifier is made up of the 
remained non-abandoned rules and default_class 
together.  
IV. CLASSIFICATION MODEL APPLIED IN CUSTOMS RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
A. Classification Model Establishment of Customs 
Inspection 
The classification model based on association rules is 
established by use of information of customs inspection to be 
applied in customs risk management. The customs inspection 
information table records the customs inspection results, 
such as correct declaration, weight discrepancies, 
incompatible production countries, different consignors and 
consignees, incorrect commodity classification, incompatible 
declaration prices etc. According to comprehensive analysis 
of these inspection results, the enterprise type, commodity 
classification, trade partner, commodity flow and trading 
method etc. mentioned in customs declaration form are 
selected as risk factors to extract sample data for mining, as 
shown in figure 1. 
 
Figure 1.  Customs Inspection Data Table 
The mining method based on association rules can adjust 
the minimum support and minimum confidence adaptively, 
resulting in an optimal classification model. The 
establishment of classification model based on association 
rules mainly consists of the following steps: 
(1) Preprocessing the data. 
(2) Generate all categories of association rules. 
(3) Build a classifier based on the generated 
association rules. 
(4) Classify the unknown classification data by use of 
the classifier. 
Because transaction data to be unsuitable for data mining 
is stored in the database, these original data is required for 
preprocessing. For the continuous attribute values, they are 
required to be discrete such as the attribute of “price”. In 
order to facilitate the classification mining based on 
association rules to generate meaningful association rules, 
these original data is also required for attribute specification. 
For example, ten conditions with unusual inspection result 
attribute occur in the experiment data. Only several records 
for some types is not conducive to the discovery of 
association rules, which requires attribute specification on 
inspection result types. All the inspection results with 
438
  
abnormal attribute values are classified into “inconsistent 
declaration”. 
B. Explemetion and result analysis 
A certain customs inspection data in total 26613 samples 
is adopted in this experiment, in which 2500 samples are 
identified to be inconsistent between customs declaration and 
actual commodity and the seized rate reaches 9.4%. The 
ultimate purpose of experiment is to establish a classification 
model based on association rules for real-time monitoring on 
classification in customs inspection. The experiment includes 
classification mining based on association rules mining and 
the establishment of classification model. 
 
Figure 2.  Association Rules Collection Generated by Apriori Algorithm  
Classification mining based on association rules can 
generate different sets of rules collection according to 
different minimum support and minimum confidence. And 
the selection of minimum support and minimum confidence 
depends on classification accuracy of established 
classification model. The results of mining association rules 
by use of Apriori algorithm in the support of 2% and the 
confidence of 20% are shown in Figure 2. Due to the 
customs seized rate less than 10%, the support and 
confidence can not be set too high. Otherwise, those small 
models may be ignored. 
TABLE I.  CLASSIFICATION TESTING BY USE OF DIFFERENT 
ASSOCIATION RULES 
minsup minconf the number  of rules

1% 20% 128 67.8% 
2% 60% 34 82.6% 
2% 36% 45 77.1% 
2% 20% 68 69.2% 
 
To make the classification accuracy achieve optimal 
threshold, this problem can be resolved through repeated 
tests. Different support and confidence is required to be set 
and the generated model is required to be tested and 
evaluated whether accord with the required accuracy or not. 
Association rules generated in different support and 
confidence are shown in TABLE I, which also includes the 
classification testing results by use of these association rules. 
It can be seen from TABLE I that the accuracy of 
classification model generated by use of classification 
method based on association rules is not very high. The main 
reason is that the experimental data is lack of some important 
attributes, for instance, “commodity type” is also an 
important risk factor, but this attribute is not identified in the 
experimental data. On the other hand, it is related to the 
characteristics of customs inspection data collection. Due to 
the customs seized rate of “abnormal seizure” less than 10%, 
it is difficult to establish classification model based on this 
set of data. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper puts forward a classification data mining 
method based on association rules. Following the analysis on 
historical customs inspection results, deep patterns and 
regularities are explored by use of data mining based on 
association rules, and a classification model is established on 
the basis of these regularities to predict the risks of 
commodity clearance. The customs supervision can use the 
potential knowledge to put forward the customs inspection 
and monitoring proposals to local conditions. The 
experiment in this paper shows that this classification model 
based on association rules can achieve good results in 
customs inspection data collection.
