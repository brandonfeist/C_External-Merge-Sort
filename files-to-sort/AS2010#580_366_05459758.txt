Abstract—In this paper, a course management system has been
designed on the basis of data mining methods such as association
rules, classification and clustering. This system aims at analyzing
the hidden relationship between the students’ academic grades
and various data of students’ performance in class, and the 
findings can be used as guidance for better teaching and learning
in the future. 
Keywords-data mining; course management; information
systems
I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of information processing
technology, all the course management systems in universities
are constantly improving. Therefore, a large amount of 
historical data about classes and students’ academic
performance has been collected, but these data has not been
taken advantage of to do more in-depth analysis for useful
information for teaching, and it’s certainly a waste of teaching 
resources. In this situation, we proposed a data mining based
course management system (DMCMS) to log the course data
generated during every class. In this system, association rules,
decision trees and clustering are integrated to do a
comprehensive mining for the hidden relationships between the
students’ academic grades and these course data. Our aim is to 
make full use of course data for valuable information to 
improve the teaching/learning quality. 
II. RELATED WORK
During the last several years, data mining techniques have
been used by many researchers to evaluate and enhance the 
higher education tasks. J. F. Superby [1] took various factors,
including the personal background of each student, the
performance of each student in his studies and each student’s
perceptions into account, adopted discriminate analysis, neural
networks, random forests and decision trees to classify students
into three groups and then predict those students' academic
success. P. Varapron [2] has used rough set theory as a 
classification approach to analyze student data where the
Rosetta toolkit was used to evaluate the student data to describe
different dependencies between the attributes and the student
status. K. Mierle [3] described the results of analyzing data
from a large collection of the so-called concurrent version
system (CVS). The proposed model is used to extract all 
information of student performance in writing the code of
assignments and to find some statistical patterns or predicators
that can be used to enhance students’ performance in writing
the code. 
Similarly, in web-based educational system, Minaei [4]
used classification techniques to analyze features extracted
from log data and marks in the final exam and predict students’
performance fairly accurately. A. Merceron [5] used
association rules algorithms to find out that mistakes were 
often related to each other when students’ mistakes were noted
down. The purpose is for the teacher to ponder and to review
the course material or emphasize subtleties while explaining
concepts to students. 
III. SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
A. Basic Idea
Data mining based course management system (DMCMS)
is mainly divided into two modules:
x Basic information management is designed to collect
course data generated in teaching and students’
performance data. Simple statistic methods are also 
realized in this module.
x Data mining module used data mining methods such as 
association rules, decision trees and clustering to do a
comprehensive analysis for the hidden relationships
between students’ academic grades and course data.

B. Data Source
There are two types of data in the system, daily data and
exam data. Daily data is generated in each class, including the
contents of each class, the approaches adopted by teachers, the 
students’ learning effect, the attendance and seat choosing
information of students. While the exam data is obtained after
middle and final examination, including the mark of each 
classroom content occupied in test, the exam mark, usual-time
mark and the final mark. The data used in our experiment is
collected from 117 students in Information Management
Department in a university during their learning of the course
Decision Analysis.
IV. BASIC INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
A. User Management
User management is designed to add, delete and modify
user information, and the administrator sets permissions for
users, and only the users with permissions can access different
interfaces. Fig. 2 shows the main interface for administrator
after login.
Figure 2. Main Interface of DMCMS 
B. Class Management
Teacher class management is designed for teachers to fill in 
the basic information of each class. Fig. 3 shows the interface
of teacher class management. Seat management is designed to
set the basic information of classrooms and seats. Student class
management is designed for students to fill in the activity data
about students in each class. 
Figure 3. Interface of teacher class management
C. Test Management
This section is designed for teachers to fill in the mark of 
each class content occupied in test according to the analysis of 
the tests (including middle and final exams), in addition, the
final mark is also input into database in this system.
D. Information Search
Information search is designed for users to search various
class data and students’ mark from database. Fig. 4 shows the
result of score information search.
Figure 4. Information Search interface in DMCMS
E. Statistic Management
x Basic statistics are mainly designed to do statistic
analysis for exam data, which shows the highest mark,
the lowest mark and the average mark of a class in the
examination. For example, the basic statistic result of 
class 06090302 in their Decision Analysis examination
is shown in Fig. 5. 
Figure 5. Basic Statistic results
x Bar Chart is used to show the number of students at
different levels in examination. The experiment result 
is shown in Fig. 6.

x Pie Chart is used to show the score proportion of each 
class content in examination. The result of experiment
is shown in Fig. 7. 
Figure 7. Pie Chart in DMCMS
Fig. 7 says, among all the class contents, Overview and
Solving of Utility Function have played important roles in
examination, so these two contents should be priority in usual
learning and review before examination.
V. DATA MINING
This module is designed to analyze the data collected in the
system by data mining methods [6, 7]. Association rules,
decision trees and clustering analysis are applied in this system.
A. Association Rules 
We implemented association rules by Apriori algorithm.
First, the data has been discredited, master(i) stands for the
students’ learning effect in classroom i, the value of this
attribute are {1,2,3,4,5}, and test(i) stands for the mark of
question i in final examination, the value of this attribute are
{A,B,C,D}, and score(i) stands for the final mark of students,
the value of this attribute are {A,B,C,D}. Fig. 8 shows the
result of association rules.
Figure 8. Apriori Result in DMCMS
In Fig. 8, the 4th association rule suggests that students
whose learning effect in the first class is 5 and in the third class
is 3 will get B in the 6th question in final examination.
According to this rule, students should stress the importance of
the contents in the first and the third classes. 
B. Decision Tree
From decision tree it is easy to generate rules in the form IF 
condition THEN outcome. In this system, decision tree is used 
to find the important factors which influence students’
academic grades. The result is designed to be displayed in a
visible way, which will be more convenient for users to find
the rules. The experiment result is shown in Fig. 9. 
Figure 9. Decision Tree Results in DMCMS 
According to Fig. 9, the students whose attendance is high
or mild will get a grade as B with the probability of 55.072%.
Thus we can draw a conclusion that the student should not be 
absent from classes.
C. Clustering
Clustering is to find data points that naturally group
together, and splitting the full data set into a set of clusters.
The partition-based K-means algorithm is applied in this
system.
There are 22 attributes in the dataset, they are score 
attribute, 8 attendance attributes with value {0,1,2}, and the
last 13 attributes stand for the students’ learning effect in 13
classes, the value of these attributes are {1,2,3,4,5}. Fig. 10
shows the clustering result.
Figure 10. K-means Result in DMCMS

We can draw a conclusion that the average grade in 
Cluster0 is obviously lower than Cluster1, the attendance in 
Cluster0 is very low, which means the students with poor 
grades should not be absent from classes.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, DMCMS: a data mining based course 
management system has been developed, and applied in many 
university courses and achieved satisfactory results. This 
research provided a certain guidance to teachers’ teaching and 
students’ learning in the future. However, the system is still 
not so perfect, and needs further improvements. Firstly, a 
systematic deviation existed in the mining results, which may 
be causes by the self complexity of education objects, or the 
volume of data is not large enough. Secondly, the algorithms 
applied in the system remain to be further optimized, and 
lastly, more data mining techniques should be applied in the 
system.
