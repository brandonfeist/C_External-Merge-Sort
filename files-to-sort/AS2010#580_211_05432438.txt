Abstract- Currently, many governments are actively 
promoting implementation of ICT to be more citizen-oriented. 
For effective citizen relationship management, it is important 
to identify the needs of different citizen groups and to provide 
respective services for each group accordingly. In this way, the 
application of data mining tools would be very useful to 
understand citizen's needs.  
In this paper, focusing on the CiRM concept, we apply a data 
mining framework on the database of Tehran municipality. 
This framework consists of clustering and the association rule 
to improve citizen satisfaction. The main objective is to find the 
factors those affect the rate of satisfaction.  
Firstly, we use the K-means algorithm to cluster the subjects 
that cause citizens complaint. Every data point is identified in 
terms of the following features: the frequency, the number of 
days that at least one complaint occurred and the interval time 
between the first and the latest time of each subject during a 
season. Secondly, the association rule is used to identify the 
factors that affect the rate of satisfaction in the cluster of 
subjects that occur regularly during the season and have a 
high number of complaints. The results of the research are 
very useful to build a strategy recommendation system in 
order to improve the rate of citizens' satisfaction. This study 
could be notable as one of the first studies on using data 
mining tools in CiRM.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The governmental services are one of the most primitive 
and predominant service domains in any community with a 
wide array of services. As such, urban services and the 
concept of citizen relationship management (CiRM) are 
currently gaining importance in this domain [7, 8]. 
The main purpose of CiRM is to understand the needs of 
different citizen groups and to provide respective services for 
each group accordingly. In this way, many governments are 
actively promoting the use of ICT. Sasaki, T., A.Watanabe, 
Y. and Minamino, K. (2007) declared in [8] that the main 
issues of this approach are "how e-governments can manage 
effectively" and "be more citizen-oriented". In other words, 
ICT can be strategically significant in promoting e-
government effectiveness through understanding the citizen 
requirements. In this domain, the application of data mining 
tools seems to be useful. Appropriate data mining tools, 
which are good at extracting and identifying useful 
information and knowledge from enormous customer 
databases, are one of the best supporting tools to obtain a 
deeper understanding of citizen’s characteristics and needs. 
In this paper, focusing on CiRM, we apply data mining 
tools to improve citizen satisfaction. We use the database of 
Tehran municipality to find the most important citizens’ 
needs. The main objective of this paper is to find those 
subjects that have a high number of complaints, the root of 
them and the factors that affect the rate of satisfaction.   
In order to accomplish this objective, we use a 
framework that consists of the clustering of subjects in terms 
of the frequency, the time interval between the first and the 
latest time and the number of days that at least one complaint 
of each subject occurred and extracting the association of the 
items which was identified as the prior citizens' needs via the 
cluster analysis. The result of this research is expected to be 
useful for development of citizen satisfaction. 
The remaining of this paper is structured as follows. In 
Section 2, we review the studies related to CiRM, clustering 
and the association rule. In Section 3, we introduce the 
hybrid method that we use. In Section 4, we apply the 
proposed model on the data of Tehran municipality in Iran.

Finally, we conclude in Section 5 and summarize the study 
results which provide valuable information for the effective 
management of urban services. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 In this section, we briefly review related studies of the 
Citizen Relationship Management, clustering, K-means 
algorithm, association rule and the Apriori algorithm. 
A. CiRM  
Citizen Relationship Management is the application of 
customer relationship management (CRM) in an e- 
governmental context and establishment guiding principles 
on how customer relations can be effectively strategized in 
the public sector. Specifically, it talks about the differences 
in CRM practices between public and private institutions. 
[7]. 
The essential purpose of CiRM is to change government-
oriented management into citizen-oriented one in 
governments. In this way, it is necessary to understand what 
citizen needs and improve the citizen satisfaction. In fact, 
CiRM applies CRM (Customer Relationship Management) 
to improve citizen satisfaction [7, 8]. 
Pan,S., Tan, C., Lim, E. (2006) claimed in [7] that 
despite the irrefutable relevance of customer relations in 
influencing the adoption of e-government systems, there has 
not been a corresponding rise in the study of CRM practices 
within the context of public eservices.  
1) Using ICT in CiRM  
As discussed in the previous section, understanding 
citizen's needs and improving the citizen satisfaction are the 
most important points in CiRM. In this way, channels to 
understand citizen's needs are required. So, it is necessary to 
restructure the inner environment and communication tools 
for sharing opinion that citizens think. By the progress of 
ICT, it has been easy to achieve [8]. Many tools are used to 
connect between public office and citizen by the advantage 
of ICT, but according to Sasaki,T., A.Watanabe,Y. and 
Minamino,K.(2007) in [8], the public sector is not able to 
provide citizen-oriented services because of the bureaucratic 
sectionalism. The way to solve this problem is to introduce 
"the citizen's voice database" which all public officers are 
able to access the database. By using this kind of call center, 
it is possible to contact between the government and citizens 
and a review and a feedback process at the whole public 
office is constructed. However, it is important not only to 
construct the review and feedback process but also managing 
the framework to apply the opinion from citizens and the 
knowledge management to share their knowledge are 
effective and required[8]. In this way, the application of data 
mining tools is expected to be useful. 
Many researchers have used data mining tools in CRM, 
but based on our researches, no one has used data mining 
techniques for CiRM. Ngai, .E.W.T., Xiu, L. and Chau, 
D.C.K. (2008) declared in [6] that Appropriate data mining 
tools, which are good at extracting and identifying useful 
information and knowledge from enormous customer 
databases, are one of the best supporting tools for making 
different CiRM decisions. 
Data mining techniques could be applied to discover 
unseen patterns of citizens' complaints. The root of the 
problems may also be uncovered by investigating the 
association between complaints from different citizens.   
B. Clustering 
Clustering is the process of grouping a set of data objects 
into groups such that objects from the same cluster are more 
similar and the objects from different clusters are more 
dissimilar [4]. 
The difference between clustering and classification is 
that clusters are unknown at the time the algorithm starts. In 
fact, there are no predefined classes in clustering. Common 
tools for clustering include neural networks and 
discrimination analysis.  
Clustering techniques have been used in CRM by Many 
researchers [1, 5, 6]. But based on our research no one has 
applied cluster analysis for citizen relationship management.  
1) K-means algorithm 
K-means is one of the well-known algorithms for 
clustering and it has been used extensively in various fields 
including data mining, statistical data analysis and other 
business applications[2]. The K-means algorithm for 
partitioning is based on the mean value of the objects in the 
cluster.  
The K-means algorithm proceeds as follows: 
First, it randomly selects K of the objects, each of which 
initially represents a cluster mean or center. For each of the 
remaining objects, an object is assigned to the cluster to 
which it is the most similar, based on the distance between 
the object and the cluster mean. It then computes the new 
mean for each cluster. This process iterates until the criterion 
function converges. Typically, the square-error criterion is 
used for cluster evaluation [4]. 
C. Association rule 
According to Tan, P., Steinbach, M. and Kumar, V. 
(2006) in [9], Association aims to establish relationships 
between items which exist together in a given record. An 
association rule is an implication expression of the form X 
? Y where X and Y are disjoint itemsets, i.e., ?=?YX . 
The strength of an association rule can be measured 
according to the support and confidence metrics. 
The support metric determines how often a rule is 
satisfied in the transaction database. It is obtained by 
dividing the support count for YX ?  by the total number 
of transactions. The confidence metric determines how often 
items in Y appear in transactions that contain X. 
Originally, association rules emerged in the domain of 
shops and customers. It is one of the most commonly used 
data mining techniques in CRM. Market basket analysis is a 
typical example of this technique. Storekeepers use the 
results of market basket analysis for various marketing 
purposes, such as how to decide on what to put on sale, how 
to place merchandize on shelves to maximize a cross selling 
effect, and how to advertise. The association rule is not 
limited to marketing problems. It is widely applied to other 
decision making problems [3, 6]. 
278
Association techniques have been used in CRM by Many 
researchers [1, 5, 6]. But based on our research no one has 
used association rules for citizen relationship management.  
Common tools for association modeling are statistics and 
apriori algorithms [6]. We use apriori algorithm in this paper 
to extract the association rules. The main characteristics of 
this algorithm are summarized as follows: 
1. Apriori is a level-wise algorithm that generates 
frequent itemsets one level at-a-time, from itemsets of size-1 
to the longest frequent itemsets 
2. At each level, new candidate itemsets are created using 
frequent itemsets discovered at the previous level. 
3. At each level, the transaction database is scanned once 
to determine the actual support count of every candidate 
itemset[9]. 
III. METHODOLOGY  
In this study, we use a hybrid method incorporating 
clustering and association rule in to a data mining approach, 
in order to offer useful strategic information for different 
kinds of complaints. It enables the municipality to find the 
important points for effective management of urban services. 
At first, we use clustering analysis to group the subjects 
that may cause citizens complaint. After that, we use 
association rules to discover the correlation among items that 
affect the rate of citizen satisfaction in the preferred cluster.  
The mining process is introduced step by step as follows: 
At step 1, we divide the subjects which cause complaint 
into several groups using K-Means clustering via following 
three measures: 
1- Frequency of complaints: frequency refers to the 
number of complaints of each subject during a season, for 
example 100 times during the winter.   
2- Time interval between complaints: time interval refers 
to the interval between the first and the latest time that a 
complaint of each subject happened during a season, for 
example 22 days. 
3- Number of days: number of days refers to the number 
of days that at least one complaint of each subject occurred.   
The advantage of clustering analysis is useful to identify 
groups of complaints with similar characteristics.  
In step 2, we use association rules to determine which 
factors affect the satisfaction rate in those kinds of 
complaints which occur permanently during the season with 
a high frequency. 
IV. CASE STUDY 
The Tehran municipality constructed an urban service 
management system by using the ICT technology to connect 
between the municipality and citizens to improve citizens' 
satisfaction. This system is focusing on managing the 
complaints against urban services and requirements. This call 
center has been established to provide appropriate and timely 
responses to citizens' demands and complaints. Currently, the 
urban service management system responses more than 3500 
phone calls per day.  
The database of this system includes proper information 
about citizens' needs and would be a key to new services and 
point of improvement. The data warehouse stores detailed 
information about citizens' calls; so we know when, why and 
at which point of geographical region, a complaint occurred. 
Many researchers have used data mining tools in CRM, 
but based on our research, no one has used data mining for 
CIRM. Besides, the number of articles focusing on the 
application of data mining techniques in complaints 
management is low. 
A. The pre-processing phase  
Raw data of this study are one-year complaint data of the 
data warehouse from 2007/03/21 to 2008/03/19. This dataset 
is composed of 45 data fields and 1,116,249 records of 
complaints. We apply the 2-step method on the data which 
refers to the winter and 5 data fields among 45 data fields. 
We substitute the mode value for missing values and 
eliminate inaccurate values. The fields and an example of the 
data are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively. 
As the citizens' needs may be different from one 
geographical region to another, we use the hybrid method for 
each region. 
As discussed in the previous section we decide to cluster 
the subjects via the following features: the frequency, the 
number of days that at least one complaint occurred and the 
interval time between the first and the latest time of each 
subject during a season.  
At first, we should calculate the above attributes for each 
subject.  In order to accomplish this objective, we create a 
new field as 'day of season' from the 'message time' field that 
shows the day of season on which the complaint occurred; 
for example the second day, the fifty forth day or the ninth 
day. By creating this field, it is possible to calculate the 
number of days on which each subject occurred and the time 
interval. Now a dataset is created that each data point shows 
a subject and is characterized by the proposed attributes.

B. Clustering  
 In this section, we use the K-means algorithm to cluster 
the subjects which cause complaint in region 1, via the 
frequency, the time interval and the number of days.  
The K-means algorithm is required to define the number 
of initial clusters K. For that, we run the K-means algorithm 
using different values of K. according to the results, the K=3 
is a suitable choice for K. The results are shown in table 3. 
Based on the results, two items has been identified as 
outliers that refer to 'the removal of ice from slippery paths' 
and 'clearing snow from roads and paths' subjects and the 
remaining items are segmented in to three clusters, while 68 
subjects belong to cluster 1, 34 subjects belong to cluster 2 
and 32 subjects belong to cluster 3. 
We also use the Tow-Step algorithm which has the 
advantage of automatically estimating the optimal number of 
clusters and handling large datasets. The result of the Two- 
Step algorithm shows that the number of clusters is three.    
The characteristics of each group are as follows: 
Cluster 1: most of the items in this cluster refer to the 
'collection and installation', 'trees' and 'parks and green 
lands', 'employees behavior' and 'animals' problems. The 
average of the interval time is about 78, but the frequency 
and the number of days are on average 19 and 29 
respectively. It means that these kinds of needs occur 
sometimes during the winter and not during a specified 
period of time; they occur almost during the whole winter 
with a low frequency. 
Cluster 2: most of the subjects in this cluster refer to the 
'construction' and 'traffic' problems. The average of 
frequency, interval time and the number of days are about 5, 
13 and 4 respectively. It means that citizens grumble 
occasionally about these kinds of subjects and not during the 
whole winter. It seems that citizens are rather neutral about 
these subjects. 
Cluster 3: most of the items in this cluster refer to the 
'garbage and waste', 'cleaning', and 'asphalt'. The average of 
frequency, interval time and the number of days are about 
358, 86 and 70 respectively. It means that these kinds of 
complaints occur permanently during the whole winter with 
a high frequency. It is notable that both subjects which we 
eliminated as outliers have the same characteristics as this 
cluster. Therefore, the complaints which refer to the 'snow', 
'garbage and waste', 'cleaning' and 'asphalt' occur with the 
highest frequency and need more attention as the prior 
citizens' needs. 
 
TABLE III.  THE RESULTS OF K-MEANS ALGORITHM 
 
 
 
 
C. Association rules 
As discussed in the previous section, the 'snow', 'garbage 
and waste', 'cleaning' and 'asphalt' are specified as the 
important prior citizens' needs in region 1 and the 
municipality should give the top priority to them. These 
kinds of complaints include 15 different subjects. The results 
show that 80 percents of the complaints in this region refer to 
the above subjects. 
The last state ID shows the state of being satisfied or not. 
We use this field and the subject to find the conditions in 
which citizens are dissatisfied. The results show that citizens 
are pleased about the service of the municipality in 11 
subjects but are not always satisfied with the four remaining 
items which are identified in table 4. The feedback 
information shows that the performance of municipality in 
handling these kinds of complaints is sometimes acceptable, 
but not often. 
Now, we use the association rules to find the factors that 
affect the state of satisfaction in handling these kinds of 
complaints. We analyze association rules using apriori 
algorithm by four input fields and confidence levels of 75%.  
Table 5 shows 8 examples of the results. These rules 
show the state of satisfaction according to the month on 
which the complaint occurs and the responsible unit. For 
example the seventh rule means that when a complaint of 
'asphalt layer' occurs in the first month of winter and the unit 
250 is responsible for handling it, the state of satisfaction is 
dissatisfied with the probability of 100%. 
The rules make it possible to understand the effect of 
'time of complaint' and 'unit' for each subject on the rate of 
satisfaction.  
Generally, a high rate of support and confidence has a 
strong mutual relation. But significant association rules are 
those which have a lift value higher than 1. All rules have 
shown the lift measure above 1. Therefore, we can say that 
the rules have a strong relationship. 
Some results of this research are as follows: 
The subjects of 'snow', 'garbage and waste', 'cleaning', 
and 'asphalt' occur permanently during the whole winter with 
a high frequency. So, the municipality performance is not 
proper in providing services which related with these 
subjects and the municipality should give top priority to the 
above items.

The municipality performance is not proper in handling 
the complaints which refer to 'asphalt settlement', 'asphalt 
layer', 'garbage collection' and 'installation of garbage ban' 
subjects. 
The probability of being satisfied is 70% in the last 
month of winter. 
The unit 82 which refers to the section 2 of region 1 has the 
best performance in the third month of winter in comparison 
with the other months in handling the 'garbage collection' 
subject. 
 The performance of municipality in handling the 
complaints of 'installation of garbage ban' subject in the first 
month of winter is very perfect and citizens feel satisfied 
with the probability of 100%. 
The unit 83 which refers to the geographical section 3 of 
this region has the best performance and can be seen as a 
benchmark for the other sections. 
Citizens feel dissatisfied with the unit 87 which refers to 
the section 5 of this region with the probability of 95%. This 
unit has a good performance just in handling the complaints 
which refer to the 'asphalt settlement' subject.  
The subjects of 'asphalt layer' and 'garbage collection' 
cause a high number of complaints in the first month of 
winter while the municipality performance is worse. 
 
V. CONCLUSTION 
Governments have to consider convenient channels and 
services to connect between the governmental managers and 
citizens.  Furthermore, data mining tools are needed to 
manage citizens' requirements and process which collect, 
analyze, reflect, and evaluate their needs.  
In this research, we have used clustering and association 
rules on the data of the urban service management system in 
Iran to find the subjects that cause complaint and the factors 
that affect the rate of satisfaction. The results show that the 
municipality should give top priority to the 'snow', 'garbage 
and waste', 'cleaning' and 'asphalt' requirements and specially 
to the 'asphalt settlement', 'asphalt layer', 'Garbage collection' 
and 'Installation of garbage ban' subjects during the winter in 
geographical region1.  
Analyzing the rules, make it possible to understand the 
impact of factors such as time and responsible units on the 
rate of satisfaction. Besides, units with a perfect or worse 
performance in providing services and handling complaints 
are identified.  
The results of the research are very beneficial in 
providing improved urban services and the development of 
citizens' satisfaction.  This study could be notable as one of 
the first studies on using data mining tools in CiRM.
