Abstract—Efficient Store Management is one important strategy 
of Category Management, how to get the character of the store 
and how to classify the stores is the aims of this study. Using the 
Association to find the goods selling knowledge, building the 
similarity matrix, and applying the Fuzzy Cluster to classify the 
stores, so the special promotion to different type of store. The 
Precision Marketing is realized by the FCBA model. 
Keywords- CM, ESM, Association, Fuzzy Cluster 
I. EFFICIENT STORE MANAGEMENT AND CATEGORY 
MANAGEMENT  
According to the Ministry of Commerce Division and the 
commercial reform and development of China Chain 
Management Association survey [1], "China's top 100 chain 
operations," sales reached 855.2 billion Yuan in 2006, an 
increase of 25 percent, much higher than the total retail sales of 
social consumer goods 13.7% ; the stores increase total to 
69,100, an increase of 57 percent, chain store Retailing has 
become an important part in China's economic development. 
Category management(abr. CM)[2,3,4] is that the 
distributor and the supplier divide those goods into different 
categories, and take each type of merchandise as a strategic 
business unit of the basic activities to do a series of related 
activities, it stresses that provide consumers with overvalue of 
products and services, enhance the effectiveness of business 
operations. Category management includes three strategies: 
efficient store management (abr. ESM), efficient product 
promotions, and efficient product introduction. 
Efficient store management mainly refers to customers face 
directly to the store and at this level the important thing is to 
optimize the management of stock and shelves. 
Efficient product promotions are to maximize customer 
satisfaction and increase the number of transactions by more 
promotions to achieve this objective, such as the payment for 
satisfaction or low prices every day.  
Efficient product introduction is to maximize new products 
of development and introduction.  
How to achieve cost-effective management of stores, 
optimizing the goods management of the store is one efficient 
ways. After the actual research, shop due to their respective 
regional characteristics and the different characteristics of 
consumers, operations of goods and scale of the stores is a 
slightly different, so the different promotional activities and 
management of goods to the stores is in the research.  
II. STORE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS 
Let the chain enterprises as the S, one store as Si, 
then },,{ 21 nsssS ?……= , and the goods as the P = {p1, 
p2, p3 … pm}, a chain store goods as siP , siP = {sp1, sp2 … 
spk}, here obviously PPsi ? . 
Headquarters to do two important managements in the 
category management: inventory management and promotional 
management. After actual research to find, each chain due to 
geographical and population factors such as different goods 
sold and the price level of high and low, so the chain can be 
classified management of goods. 
According to index of store: such as store area, sales, gross 
profit, the chain store can be divided into certain types of store, 
for example, according to the area of store, chain stores can be 
divided into: size, more than the standard size, smaller than 
standard size, etc. In accordance with the above can also 
combine several index, a word is to scientific management 
shops, to address consumer goods Distribution and marketing 
purposes. 
III. THE MERCHANDISE ASSOCIATION RULES OF SINGLE-
STORE 
A      Association [5, 6, 7]  
Let I = (i1, i2... im) is a set of items (a supermarket mall 
may have 10,000 kinds of the goods), D is a set of transactions 
(called transaction database). Each T is a group of articles in 
the D, apparently to meet T ? I, which is named transaction T 
support X., if X T. Association Rules is a form contains the 
following: XY, which X ? I, Y ? I, and X ? Y =?.  
(1)Items sets X have the support of s, if the s% transactions 
in the D support items set X;  
978-1-4244-4639-1/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE
(2)The association rules X?Y has a support of “s” in the 
database D, if an items set X ? Y has a support of s;  
(3) Said rules X?Y has the credibility degree of c in the 
database of D, if the transaction which support items set X 
have c%  of X  which support the set Y. 
The general association rules algorithm used Aprio 
algorithm, except that also the Fp Tree, DIC algorithm.

Fig.1 Snack Foods Category Tree 
Through the association (In the SAS software, for support of 
0.5 percent, 10 percent confidence), the following rules: 
TABLE I.  ASSOCIATION RULES 
Association Rules 
Chen Pi Mei ==> squid wire 
More flavor peanut+ tomato==> Matchmaker fish  
Mango chips ==> Drunk Love Peanut 
Pistachio ==> Hickory 
potato chips ==> banana chips 
Pistachio ==> small yellow croaker 
Through the above rules, be able to tell, pistachios and 
Pecan close relationship between the sales and promotional 
products can pay attention to, the purchase of one product in 
the circumstances, the purchase of the other products. Passed, 
also presented Fried Fruit category and Pecan type of 
relationship, if we take quantitative analysis, as shown below: 
TABLE II.  CATEGORY RULES 
Category Rules Ratio of Sales 
Ratio of 
quantity 
Candied fruit ==> seafood 5% 0.7% 
Fried Fruit ==> Fried Fruit 10% 36% 
Fried Fruit ==> Candied fruit 3% 5% 
Fried Fruit ==> seafood 7% 3% 
Through the commodities category analysis can see that in 
the sales category Fried fruit occupy an important role, mainly 
sales, but the main sales price is not the highest, high-priced 
goods are walnut and seafood category, which is targeted for 
the high gross profit enterprises. 
 
 
C   Problems  
The above analysis is for single-store analysis, but as a 
chain enterprise, how to grasp the overall situation, how to 
learn all the features of chain store and how to extract the sales 
knowledge aren’t satisfied. Below the fuzzy cluster model to 
classified the chain stores based on single-store association 
rules is to be designed, next how to use this mode realize the 
different management according to the different store is 
discussed. 
IV. THE CHAIN STORE FUZZY CLUSTER MODEL BASED ON 
THE GOODS ASSOCIATION RULES 
A. Fuzzy cluster and FCBA 
Fuzzy Cluster [8, 9]: from a number of the various needs 
characters of users, find the statistics which can measure the 
similar features among the users or among the needs 
characters, constitute a matrix of symmetry similarity. 
According to the similarity degree, classify the users or needs 
characters one by one. The little clusters include some close 
user or needs characters and the large clusters include some far 
users or needs characters. Until the entire user needs or 
completed variables are gathered to form a hierarchical 
relationship for a more natural and intuitive user to show 
Category the difference and contacts are showed among the 
users or the needs characteristics. 
Distributed Store management models combine association 
rules and fuzzy clustering to do a series data mining and the 
whole process is called FCBA model. The FCBA firstly gets 
the sales of different store and extract the association rules, and 
compare the strong rules of every store to build a similarity 
matrix, which is calculated by the same degree of association 
rules, and then use fuzzy clustering method to get the stores 
category [10, 11, and 12]. 
Fig.2: Distributed Store Management Model 
B.  Similarity Factor 
Firstly, get the sales of different store and extract the 
association rules of separate store, Secondly, compare the 
strong rules of every store to build a similarity matrix, which is 
calculated by the same degree of association rules. 
The definition of similar factors as ijr : If the two store i  
and j  have the same rules, 1=ijr , if two stores have not 
exactly the same rules, then

)(
AllRulesSum
SameRulesSumrij = , 10 ?? ijr . 
For example, All rules is 8? 6 rules are same in the table 
so 75.0=ijr .

D.  Equivalence Matrix by Square Method 
After this work, can be nn×  matrix R , the degree of 
similarity of every store. If they meet:  
Reflexivity: That is 1, =? iiri . 
Symmetry: That is jiij rrji =?? ,,  
Transitivity: That is .,...2,1,,, nkjirrr ikjkij =??   
The similarity matrix R  is similar matrix, but not 
necessarily meets the transitivity. Therefore, must to build a 
new fuzzy equivalence matrix from the similarity matrix. 
Fuzzy R  matrix contains the smallest fuzzy equivalent R 
matrix called the transitive closure, recorded as )(Rt , here 
using square method to get the )(Rt  
Here , )(1

If there is a k,

12)( ?= kRRt . 
E.  Forming cluster 
R is for the fuzzy equivalent matrix. Can prove that, if and 
only if the R is fuzzy equivalent matrix, for any of the ? ? [0, 
1], R ?-cut set of Matrix R is the general equivalence Boolean 
matrix. In accordance with the ?-cut of R, different cut-off 
relationship can be a different classification.  
And if 21 ?? < , while the separation of each category by 
2?R  must be the sub-categories by 1?R , so when ? declines 
from 1 to 0, classification gradually merge, forming a dynamic 
fuzzy clustering. 
For example, the similarity of above can be calculated 
below as: 
??
??
??
?

Then the  4)( RRt = .

Then the two categories: },}{,,{ 43521 SSSSS . 
If 5.0=? , all the store are in one category. 
The store category is got by the model FCBA, then 
different promotion or goods management for different stores, 
or different stores suitable for the different promotions. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes the similarity factor based on the 
association rules according to the stores classified management 
issues, and a fuzzy analysis on the basis of similarity matrix, so 
the stores classification model FCBA is designed, which be 
helpful to the promotion management and Commodity 
Management to the different stores, and which is conducive to 
chain enterprises to develop category management. Through 
practical application, the model is feasible. Next, how the 
marketing tests on the basis of classification will be studied 
further.
