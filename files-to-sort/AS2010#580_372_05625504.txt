1Fault-Pattern Discovery in Sequences of Voltage
Sag Events
Oscar Quiroga, Joaquim Mele´ndez, and Sergio Herraiz
Abstract—A pattern discovery approach applied to sequences
of voltage sags is proposed for fault modeling and failure
prediction. It is assumed the existence of some failures that are
the result of accumulated stress produced by overcurrents during
previous faults or the existence of pattern sequences produced by
the reclosing of the protection system in presence of a fault. So
there may exist relationships between events. Events registered
in a real power distribution system are analyzed to search those
fault patterns. The events considered in this study are voltage
sags generated by homopolar faults and registered by power
quality monitors installed in the secondary of transformers in
distribution substations. The ordered list (according to their time
of ocurrence) of events corresponds to a sequence, and magnitude
and duration are the attributes considered to describe the events.
The aim of this work is to ?nd patterns in a sequence of voltage
sags that allow to recognize relationships between different types
of sags occurred along time.

I. INTRODUCTION
VOLTAGE sags are consequence of power systems opera-tion (load and capacitors switching, transformer energiz-
ing, etc.) and faults occurrence (phase-to-ground or phase-to-
phase short-circuits). These disturbances propagating through
the network affects power quality and can cause serious
effects on instruments, machinery and production lines with
the consequent ?nancial losses. According to IEC, a supply
voltage dip is a sudden reduction in the supply voltage to a
value between 90% and 1% of the declared voltage, followed
by a recovery between 10 milisecond and 1 minute later. For
the IEEE a voltage drop is only a voltage sag if thereduction
is between 10% and 90% of the nominal voltage.
Since the motivation of this work is to assist maintenance
planning providing tools to improve predictive strategies, we
focus only on those voltage sags produced by faults and
failures. A power system component failure ( transformers,
insulators, cables, arresters, etc.) affects directly the power
continuity supply as well as the reliability of the affected
component due to overcurrent and propagation of the voltage
sags. So, consecutive shortcircuits in the same feeder can
accelerate degradation of some components due to stress.

Those effects are only visible after long periods of time. In this
paper we propose the analysis of historical registers of voltage
sags in order to discover possible misbehavior patterns.
Existing strategies to assess power quality of a distribution
network using the historical registers of voltage sags gathered
during long periods of time (one year or more) are the
density tables and other statistical methods (stochastic power
assessment) derived from those representations [1]. Those
methods are reduced to compute the number of sags in the
observation period organised in subsets, characterized by depth
and duration. Those tables can be used to model a network and
predict the expected number of sags in a further given period
[1]. Different approaches have been proposed in the literature
for measuring and predicting the severity of voltage sags in a
network, assessing the compatibility of customer equipments
as well as to predict future failures under a probabilistic
approach [1], [2], [3]. In all those approaches sags are treated
as independent events, i.e, a random process. However, other
works show that this independence is not always true. This is
for example the case of equipment failures caused by natural
degradation [4] or ageing effect of overcurrents [5]. In [6]
and [7] advanced monitoring and data recording equipment
are used to document multiple failure phenomena related with
gradual degradation of line devices.
In this paper, we assume the existence of those sequences
of dependent events directly related with system faults and/or
failures. Hence, we consider a set of successive events reg-
istered in a single point of the network during a speci?c
period of time as a sequence of events, and the aim is to ?nd
patterns in that sequence that represent evident relationships
among events contained in that pattern. With that aim we use
basic algorithms for episodes discovery in event sequences
[8]. Those algorithms have been widely used in other ?elds
involving data inherently organized in a sequential nature such
as: alarms in a communications networks, faults report logs
from an assembly line in a manufacturing plant [9], internet
anomaly intrusion detection, bio-medical data analysis, stock
trend prediction, etc.
The paper is organized in three additional main sections.
Next section presents those pattern discovery algorithms to
be used in sequences of events and the adaptation to analyze
sequences of events. Section III is focused on the results
obtained when those algorithms are applied in a real data base
of voltage sags gathered during three yeas in a distribution
substation. Finally, the paper highlights main conclusions in
section IV.

2II. PATTERNS DISCOVERY IN SEQUENCES OF VOLTAGE
SAGS
Under the consideration that several events in a sequence
of events are related to each other and follow a prede?ned
pattern we propose the use of pattern discovery algorithms to
?nd those patterns. This idea is supported by the following
assumptions:
• Several events (voltage sags) originated in nearby points
of the network can induce a failure in an aged element
located in the path of the overcurrent between te trans-
former and the affected point.
• The fault location is related with the magnitude of the
voltage sag caused by the fault [1]. Then sags with
similarities in magnitude and duration occur in nearby
region of the network.
• A component failure can cause multiples voltage sags by
the actuation of the protection systems according to the
reclosing settings [10].
• Many faults occur in a reduced number of points or areas
of the line. This happens for example with fault caused
by tree/animal contacts or lighting induced events.
Therefore, the goal is to ?nd automatically those prede?ned
patterns in sequences of events. Multiple criteria can be
considered for this purpose, for example, the frequency of
apparition of those patterns.
A. Description of the Proposed Solution
In order to typify the events we use the intervals suggested
in voltage sag density tables, which is a common method
for presenting large repositories (or surveys) of sags gathered
during long periods of time (more than one year) according
to their magnitude and duration. There are several proposed
tables [11], but in this work we have used the intervals
of the table recommended by the standard IEC-61000-2-8
[12]. For the magnitude the events have been split in nine
categories de?ned by the intervals: 80%-90%, 70%-80%, 60%-
70%, 50%-60%, 40%-50%, 30%-40%, 20%-30%, 10%-20%
and <10%. For the duration the intervals are: <0.1s, 0.1s-
0.25s, 0.25s-0.5s, 0.5s-1s, 1s-3s, 3s-20s, 20s-60s and 60s-180s.
Then, we can have 72 different types of events (one for each
cell obtained when the previous segmentation of depth and
duration is combined).
B. Nomenclature: Sequences and Episodes
Two basic methods for pattern discovery in sequences were
developed in [8]. Terminology and methods used in this work
have been inherited from it, and are described below: Given
a set E of event types, an event is a pair (A, t) where A
is a type of event, A ? E, and t is its time of occurrence.
A sequence of events s can be expressed as (s, Ts, Te),
where s = ?(A1, t1), (A2, t2), ..., (An, tn)?, Ai ? E for all
i = 1, ..., n, ti ? ti+1 for all i = 1, ..., n ? 1, Ts is the
beginning time of the sequence and Te is the ending time of
the sequence, being Ts ? ti < Te for all i = 1, ..., n.
An episode is a collection of partially ordered events that
occur together. The events in an episode must occur close
enough, being the user who decides how close the events must
be to be considered part of an episode. This decision is made
by de?ning a sliding time window, which is an event sequence
w = (w, ts, te), where ts < Te and te > Ts, and w consists
of pairs (A, t) from s, where ts ? t < te. The time span te?ts
is the width of the window, win. The objective is to ?nd within
the sequences all the frequent episodes of a particular class.
There are several classes of episodes: serial episodes, when
events occur strictly in that order in the sequence; parallel
episodes, where the relative order of events in the sequence is
not restricted, and non-serial and non-parallel episodes, which
can be seen as a combination of serial and parallel episodes.
Fig. 1 shows an example of an event sequence and the different
classes of episodes represented as directed acyclic graphs.
The episodes are built iteratively, starting from events and
subepisodes which also must be frequent. It is de?ned that
an episode ? is a subepisode of ? if the events of ? also
belong to ? in the same partial order as ? and the events of ?
are connected to all events of ? that are not in ?. An example
of this type can be seen in Fig. 1.
C. Description of Methods for Episodes Discovery in Se-
quences
In the ?rst method called WINEPI [8], the frequency or
support (fr) of an episode is calculated as the number or
fraction of windows where the episode occurs. However,
this support over-estimates the ocurrence of an episode [13].
The user must specify the minimum frequency (min fr) to
consider an episode as frequent. Basic algorithm to discover
frequent serial episodes developped in [8] is showed next
and basically consists in that the algorithm computes the
collection of frequent episodes from a de?ned class, in this
case only serial episodes. The search starts from episodes
with only one event (frequent events). Result of this ?rst step
is equivalent to density tables. Then, in each new level the
algorithm computes a collection of candidate episodes, and
then checks their frequency of occurrence from the event
sequence. The candidate generation is based on the lemma: if
an episode ? is frequent in a sequence s, then all sub-episodes
? ? ? are aso frequent. So, candidate episodes are built from
the previously obtained frequent events. The structure of the
WINEPI algorithm is:
Input: A set E of event types, an event sequence s over E, a
class ? of episodes (serial, parallel or non-serial non-parallel),
a window width win, and a frequency threshold min fr.
Output: The collection F of frequent episodes.
Method:
1) Search the set C1 of candidate episodes which have a
length of 1 (only one event).
2) Initialise a counter l in 1, to count the length of the
episodes.
3) Open a while rutine to evaluate the candidate episodes
and ?nd the frequent episodes until that do not have new
candidate episodes.
• Make a routine to evaluate the frequency of the
candidate episodes of length l.
 
??
3Fig. 1. Event sequence and classes of episode. Note that the top of the
?gure show the sequence of events and in the bottom of the ?gure there are
a example of the three classes of episode that can be found
• Extract the frequent episodes of length l and iden-
ti?ed as Fl.
• Increase the counter l in 1 i.e make l = l + 1;
• Make a routine for generates the candidates of
length l, Cl, from the frequent episodes of length
l ? 1. This collection of candidates consists of
episodes such that all subepisodes are frequent.
4) For all l do output Fl;
The second method, called MINEPI [8], consists in looking
at the instants of ocurrence of the episodes and the time
relationships between those ocurrences instead using sliding
windows and evaluate if an episode occurs in a window or not.
For each frequent episode the information about the locations
of its minimal ocurrences (mo) is stored. A minimal ocurrence
(mo) of an episode ? is an interval such that no proper
subwindow contains the episode ? e.g., in the Fig. 1, episode
?E? has mo frecuency or support 3 (interval [5, 5], interval
[35, 35]) and interval [75, 75]), while episode ?E,F ? has mo
frecuency or support 2 (interval [5, 10]) and interval [35, 40]).
D. Formulation of Association Rules to Describe the Fault-
Pattern
Association rules describe the connections between events
in a sequence. They are obtained from frequent episodes but
especi?cally from the frequent episodes called episodes rule
[8]. An episode rule is an implication of the form ? ? ?,
where ? is and subepisode of ?. The fraction fr(?)/fr(?) is
the con?dence of the rule (conf ), and can be interpreted as
the conditional probability that the entire episode ? occurred
in a window if a subepisode ? has occurred in it. For instance,
if the episode ? showed in Fig. 1 is a subepisode of ?, and ?
occurs in 5% of windows, i.e. fr(?) = 5%, and ? occurs in
4% of windows, i.e. fr(?) = 4%, it can be estimated that after
appearing events A and B in a window, there is a possibility
of 0.8 to obtain the event C in the same window.
III. MAIN RESULTS
The results obtained applying the proposed methodology are
presented in this section. Here, the WINEPI method is used
for frequent pattern discovery. This algorithm has the bene?t
of assigning a con?dence index to the frequent episodes that
allow to interpret them in terms of a probability of occurrence.

voltage sag according to the table recommended by the standard IEC-61000-
2-8.
A. Dataset Description
Voltage sags caused by single-phase faults (homopolar
faults) in the distribution system have been considered in
this study. Events have been registered in the secondary of
a power distribution transformers (25kV) over three years by
the utility1 using a power quality monitor. A substation with
a large number of events registered have been considered in
the study. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding voltage sag density
chart, build according to the standard IEC-61000-2-8. Fig. 2
contains a total of 527 voltage spread in columns where each
cell in the ?gure represents a different type of event (classi?ed
according to duration and magnitude) and the height of each
bar indicates the number of sags in each cell registered during
the three years.
Table I exempli?es the representation of those events sorted
according to the time. Each event has three main attributes:
time is the occurren date of the event (timestamp); duration
is the time that the voltage sags remains in the system accord-
ing to the voltage sag de?nition; magnitude corresponds to
the maximum voltage drop during the event, expressed as a
percentage of the nominal voltage rms value.
B. Frequent Episodes in a Sequence of Voltage Sags
From the time, duration and magnitude of each event, we
applied WINEPI algorithm to ?nd frequent episodes under
the next two principal thesis: a) actuation of reclosers in
presence of a fault will produce short-time episodes associated
to the reclosing settings; b)frequent shortcircuits can cause
over-stress and degradation in components connected between
the shorticircuit and the transformer.

For simplicity in the test, each type of voltage sag (Fig. 2) is
represented by the corresponding number of row and column
in the density table (standard IEC-61000-2-8). For example, a
voltage sag type 42 represents sags with a magnitude between
50% to 60%, and duration between 0.1s to 0.25s while a
voltage sag type 74 represents sags with a magnitude between
20% to 30%, and duration between 0.5s to 1s.
The parameters selected for frequent episodes discovery are
the following: a window width of 45 days, a minimum support
min fr = 0.4 and for the association rules a minimum
con?dence conf = 0.5. Table II shows the frequent episodes
found in the sequence after applying the WINEPI algorithm,
with the support and the minimum, median and maximum
span time of each episode (span time is computed as the time
difference between the ?rst and the last event of an episode).
With the parameters used, only two frequent episodes are
discovered. The quantity of frequent episodes can increase if
the window width is increased or the minimum support is
decreased.
The span times in the table II suggest that the events in
the episodes occur within intervals of a few seconds until
several days. When the time span between events is very
small, seconds or minutes, probably they corresponds to the
same failure and ocurred by the reclosing actuation of the
protection system. If the time span between events is around
days, probably these events occur because of distinct faults or
failures. Maximun span time between events is limited by the
width of the temporal window used.
The relationships between the event types that appear in the
two frequent episodes discovered in the sequence of events
can have a physical meaning, i.e., that the occurrence of
certain failures are the precursors of new faults, therefore if the
?rst event in the episode occurrs will likely occur the whole
episode. In this work those relations have not been veri?ed
physically in the power network.
Table II shows that the ?rst episode is conformed by events

The sequence are conformed by a set of events type distributed along the
time according to the ocurrence date. Frequent episodes (see table II) are

of the same type. According to the time span, this occurred
between few seconds until few days (median span time less
than two days). This suggests the episode is related with faults
occurred in the same or nearby region of the network (same or
similar magnitude). On the other hand, the second episode is
conformed by events of different type (different magnitude),
i.e., the episode is related with faults occurred in different
regions of the network. It may be observed that magnitude of
the second event in the episode is lower (50%? 60% for the
?rst event -type 43- and 20%? 30% for the second one -type
74-). Also, in this episode the time span between the events
is longer than in the ?rst episode. The relationship between
the events in this episode can be casual, but the frequent
occurrence along the sequence suggest that it is probably
physical relations between the two types of events.
Fig. 3 shows the apparition of the frequent episodes (Table
II) along the sequence without overlapping events. The events
highlighted and linked by a dotted line belong to the same
episode which occur several times during the sequence. Fig 3
also shows that the two episodes appear regularly along the
sequence.
Pattern-faults are discovered from the frequent episodes
by the formulation of association rules that relate episodes
with subepisodes (or events). Each rule has a certain level of
con?dence. Table III shows the pattern episodes associated
discovered for the network point analyzed.
The ?rst fault-pattern ?42? ? ?42, 42? showed in Table III
relates two sags of the same type. According to this rule, there
are a probability of 0.86 that once occurred an homopolar fault
whose type is 42 (Fig. 4) then a new one could occur, within
a time less than 45 days in the same point or area of the

Second fault-pattern showed in Table III relates two sags of
different type ?43? ? ?43, 74?. According to this rule, there
are a probability of 0.63 that once ocurred an homopolar fault
whose type is 43 (Fig. 5) then a new homopolar fault of type
74 (Fig. 6) also could occur, within a time less than 45 days.
In this case the new fault might occur in other region of the
network located upstream of the ?rst fault.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Relationships between homopolar faults in a network are
found after analysing the sequence of events registered during
a period of three years in a distribution substation. The
magnitude an duration of the corresponding voltage sags have
been used to characterize the events. The WINEPI algorithm
has been used to discover frequent patterns described by
episodes (sequences of events). The proposed solution shows
that useful information about the behavior and evolution of the
faults in the electrical system may be extracted for the recog-
nition of future failures. In particular two speci?c behaviours
described by episodes of two events have been discovered.
First one possibly corresponds to the reclosing operation due
to permanent faults in the same area of the network because
the short occurrence time between both events in the episode.
Last, the second pattern corresponds to faults separated in time
by several days resulting in a more dif?cult interpretation of
its physical meaning but they can give information about what
may be expected if a voltage sag of this type occurr. The use
of different sliding windows allows to explore fault-patterns
at different time levels.
Future work should continue evaluating the behavior of
other attributes in the voltage sag recorded on other points of
the network and other classes of recorded events to discover
fault-patterns that can be used to forecast future failures.
