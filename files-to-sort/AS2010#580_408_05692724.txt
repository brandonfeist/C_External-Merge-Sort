Abstract—In existing mobile content service systems, the
study is quite rare on automatic situation-service rule
construction. Hence, a method is proposed that the semantic
association rules between situations and preferences are
built by quantitative frequent marked lattice. Different
recommendation rules can be extracted along multi-
dimensional context routes from this lattice structure. It is
propitious to solve the problems of rule collisions and
availability of context data. The algorithm is studied for
frequent marked lattice construction and the priority is
designed for rule extraction. Finally, the advantage and
feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by a
calculating instance.

I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile content recommendation means to deliver the
related contents to the users proactively based on users’
preferences, locations, behavior habits, etc. The contexts
are crucial issues that are used to characterize the
situations of mobile users[1]. Effective utilization of
context information makes it feasible to provide the right
contents for the right users in the right situations, and thus
enhances the quality and utility of recommendation [2].
In recent years, many models and frameworks have
been introduced for context-aware pervasive services.
Ontology-based models are widely adopted in this domain
because of the supporting capability of knowledge sharing
and logical reasoning. However, the reasoning rules are
predefined manually in most systems such as the projects
of CoBrA[3], SOCAM[4], FLAME2008[5]. Generally, the
relationship between user preferences and situations can
not be recognized simply and clearly, and as a result, the
predefined rules are short of flexibility and accuracy.
Aiming at this problem, some solutions have been
proposed about automated learning mechanism in the last
two years. Choi et al.[6] adopt information entropy to
calculate dependency between preferences and contexts,
however, their method can not dispose the semantic
problems. Bai et al.[7] proposed an ontology-based
case-based reasoning model, deriving corresponding
service rules by computing the similarity between actual
situations and situation cases. However, there is no
detailed explanation on case library construction in
learning process. Kwon et al.[8] utilize concept lattice to
produce recommendation rules, but they only consider the
correlation between services and single dimension of
contexts.
The research is still rare on machine learning
approaches in context-aware service domain. Moreover,
the situation-service rules are taken as certain rules in
related works. To improve the antinoise ability of rules in
actual applications, association rules are more suitable to
describe the relations between preferences and situations.
In this paper, we focus on semantic association rule
mining between situations and preferences through
quantitative frequent marked lattice(QFML). Dynamic
contexts are taken as the factors to describe the situations
of mobile users. The main tasks include: impact
identification of various contexts on preferences,
relationship establishment between preference sets and
situation sets, and rule extraction according to different
conditions. The rest of this article is organized as follows:
Section 2 introduces the ontology models involved. The
method of rule mining and extracting through QFML is
demonstrated in Section 3. The advantage and feasibility
of the proposed method is illustrated by a calculating
instance in Section 4. The conclusion and future work is
covered in the last section.
II. ONTOLOGIES FOR MOBILE CONTENT
RECOMMENDATION
An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a
shared conceptualization[9]. The situation-preference
ontology model is an explicit description of user
preferences, situations and the relations between them. Its
target is to construct a common and extendable semantic
model for knowledge sharing and reuse among distributed
and heterogeneous agents or systems.
A. Relationship between Preferences and Situations
The situation-preference ontology model is described
in Fig. 1.
Figure 1. Situation-preference ontology model
The model includes four basic concepts(Classes) of
user, preference, context and situation. The relations of
these concepts are defined as transitive ObjectProperty in
OWL. Context is treated as a bridge role to connect

Preference with Situation because different preferences do
not depend on situations directly, but depend on different
dimensional contexts such as time, location. Different
contexts are defined as the subclass of Context, and
moreover, the restriction is given that there is no
intersection among concept sets of different contexts for
subsequent collision detection and matchmaking. Degrees
of preference and dependency are defined as Datatype
Property in OWL. Figure 2 shows the OWL description
segment in Fig. 1.
Figure 2. The OWL description segment
Situation may be expressed as a set of property-value
pairs: Situation={c1:V1;c2:V2…cn:Vn}, where cj means
“has_cj_Property” and is modeled as subProperty of
“describedBy” in Fig. 2. If Vj is defined as the concept in
context ontology, a semantic situation is formed which
corresponds to a cluster of situation instances in raw
historical records. Preferences are used to describe
content subjects that users are interested in and a
preference class also corresponds to a cluster of contents.
B. Hierarchy of Content Services and Contexts
According to the requirements in different problem
domains, raw data need to be mapped into the different
concept levels of corresponding ontologies. An example
of concept hierarchy is given in Fig. 3.
Figure 3. Hierarchy model of contents and contexts
S denotes content service class and C denotes context
class. S1,S2,S3 denote the classes of Game, News, Music;
C1,C11,C12 denote: DailyTime, DayTime, NightTime;
C2,C22 denote: Location, SportsPlace; C3,C31,C32 denote:
Weather, GoodWeather and BadWeather. The shaded
areas and connecting line present that a mobile user has
the content preferences of {S21=SportsNews; S31=Pop-
Music; S32=ClassicalMusic} in Situation1={c1:C113=
(16:30-17:30)Period; c2:C221=Playground; c3:C31=Good-
Weather}; and Situation2={c1:C122=(19:00-21:00)Period;
c2:C222=Gymnasium; c3:C31=BadWeather}.
Situation set is composed of the situations
corresponding to the same preference set. In the course of
situation-preference association rule mining, the core task
is to build the relationship between situation sets and
preference sets.
III. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING BETWEEN SITUATIONS
AND PREFERENCES
The Galois lattice theory[10] provides a concise,
complete and visualized approach for knowledge
representation. It is widely used in the domains of data
mining, knowledge engineering and information retrieval,
etc. Based on the models above, an approach is proposed
to build the relationship between situations and
preferences by QFML. It is convenient to extract different
rules and contributes to reduce computing complexity.
A. Preprocessing
Raw data cannot be used by system directly due to
their sparsity. The first task in preprocessing is turning the
raw data into the ontological concepts by mapping
mechanism, merging the same records and keeping down
their counts.
Various contexts do not have the same impact on
users’ preferences. Moreover, too many contexts not only
increase computing complexity, but also hamper clear and
concise decision making. Then, it is necessary to reduce
some context dimensions according to their importance.
The second task is to get the service count table mnCS
under different context concepts, and then to derive the
dependency matrix. The element CSjki in mnCS denotes
the count of content service class Si under the kth
concept of context Cj . The relations between preferences
and contexts may be weighed by information entropy[6].
The calculating formula is given by (1):

The dependency matrix may be defined as
m
n
m
n HIDS - , where I is unit matrix. Setting threshold
to mnDS , the unimportant contexts are reduced. Then,
setting minimum support count to mnCS , the reduced
Frequent Marked Context (FMC) is obtained. The FMC is
different from conventional formal context because its
rows denote frequent classes instead of objects and its
columns denote frequent attributes of the classes.
3824
B. Relationship Establishment
After preprocessing procedure, the conceptualized
record table and the reduced FMC are obtained. They are
inputs for situation-prefenrence association rules mining.
Definition 3.1[11]: Let B)(A,=C1 is a concept in Galois
lattice L , B),A(=C2 is called quantitative concept of
1C , A denotes the cardinality of A . If A satisfies
the minimum support count, 1C is called frequent concept,
and iB (i =1,2, 3…k) is basic frequent item in B .
Definition 3.2: If there is a frequent subset S in the object
set of )B,A(=C , then )B,S(CFM  is defined as
frequent marked concept of C . FMC is derived from other
knowledge different from attribute knowledge in L . The
structure QFML is called Quantitative Frequent Marked
Lattice (QFML), which is composed of quantitative
concepts and their frequent marked concept sets
B)),S|,SSet(|,A( ii .
The method for establishing the situation-preference
association by QFML is described as follows:
Using FMC as a reference, the lattice is built layer by
layer from top to bottom, increasing a combined
dimension of contexts for each layer of lattice. The key
problem forming a node is to examine whether there are
frequent service subsets in the object set of the Cartesian
Product of multidimensional contexts. The top-down
method is convenient to prune the redundant nodes
rapidly.
It is necessary to clarify that the FMC only plays a
reference role, and QFML construction does not depend
on it completely. The reason is that a super-concept is
frequent, but its sub-concepts may not be frequent, not to
mention that the sub-concepts have frequent marked
concept sets. The FMC is used for bitVector conjunction
calculation. For example, there is a FMC as Tab.1:
TABLE I. EXAMPLE OF FMC
C11 C12 C21 C22 C31 C32
S1 1 0 0 1 0 0
S2 0 1 1 1 0 1
The bitVectors of context concepts are as follows:
V[C11]=10; V[C12]=01; V[C21]=01;
V[C22]=11; V[C31]=00; V[C32]=01.
Since V[C11]&V[C21]=00, the combined attributes
(C11C21) can not form the node in QFML. However, to the
combined attributes (C12C22C32), V[C12]&V[C22]&V[C32]=01;
they need further calculating and judging. BitVector
conjunction calculation can improve the efficiency of
QFML construction.
C. Recommendation Rules Extraction
According to different conditions, different rules need
to be extracted from QFML. If the situation is known,
situation-service rules need to be extracted; and if the
content is known, service-situaion rules need to be
extracted. Formula (2) is adopted to calculate the
semantic similarity of various contexts, content
preferences respectively.

))B(Sup)A(Sup(Card
=)B,A(Sim


. (2)
}X?A,O?X?|X{=)A(Sup denotes the super-concept
set in the corresponding ontology O ; )(Card denotes
the cardinality of set.
Because the nodes of deeper layer in QFML include
more context dimensions, the rules derived from the
deeper nodes are endowed with higher priority. If the
layers of nodes are the same, the support(  ) and
confidence(  ) parameters will be compared for rule
priority. After rule extraction procedure, the priority-
ranked rule set is acquired. The flow chart for rule
extraction is described in Fig. 4.
Figure 4. Flow chart of rule extraction procedure
The advantage of the mothed proposed in this paper is
that the situations and preferences can be searched along
respective routes. The rules extracted from QFML are
frequent, and the relevant parameters can be obtained
directly. Furthermore, it is feasible to search situations
along different context dimensions. If some context data
can not be acquired in time or their precision and
reliability can not reach a given standard, some useful
rules may still be acquired for recommendation.
IV. CASE STUDY
A calculating instance is given in this section. The raw
data are obtained from observation of user behaviors.
Taking the historical records of a mobile user in a month
as calculating data, we get 32 count records via clustering
49 raw record data to ontological concepts. The frequent
context-preference count table is listed in Tab.2
(min_supp_count=4).

{S1,S2,S3,S4} denote the content service classes: {Financial

(21:30-23:30)Period}; {L1,L2,L3} denote: {WorkingPlace,
EatingPlace, DwellingPlace}; {W1,W2} denote: {GoodWeather,
BadWeather}.

3) Recommendation rules extraction
a) Assuming that the pending content is similar to S1
after semantic matching, the rule set and (  ,  )
parameters from different layer are derived as follows:
Layer1[#2,#3,#7]:
#2-Rule: pref=S11; (8.16% , 25%)
#3-Rule: pref=S12; (16.33%, 50%)
#7-Rule: pref=S1 l=L3; (18.37%, 56.25%)
Layer2[#8,#9]:
#8-Rule: pref=S11^l=L3; (8.16%, 25%)
#9-Rule: pref=S12^l=L3; (10.2% , 31.25%)
Adoping the priority designed in Section 3.3, the prior
order of rules is: Rule#9>Rule#8>Rule#7>Rule#3>Rule
#2. It means: if the content relevant to Financial news is
sent to the user, the best situation will be Situation=
{t:(11:30-13:30)Period; l:DwellingPlace} (Rule#9)
b) Assuming that the current situation of mobile user
is Situation={t:T1;l:L2;w:W2} after similarity computing.
Since w:W2 is reduced by support and dependency
paramaters, it only needs to search {t:T1; l:L2}.
Layer1[#2,#5]:
#2-Rule: t=T1	
1; (8.16%, 50%)
#5-Rule-1: l=L2	
2; (8.16%, 30.77%)
#5-Rule-2: l=L2	
3; (12.24%, 46.15%)
There is no node in Layer2 which satisfies the
condition that its attribute set is the subset of {t:T1; l:L2},
so no recommendation should be performed. Otherwise,
we may select the rules derived from the nodes in Layer1
according to (  , ) parameters, or decrease the threshold
of similarity to get more context concepts and perform a
new search in QFML.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, an approach is proposed in which
ontology and FCA are used together for semantic
association rules mining between preferences and
situations. The proposed QFML structure reduces needed
node number. It is propitious to extract different rules
along respective routes and to calculate relevant
parameters. The priority of rules is designed and
discussed. In preprocessing procedure, the method of
context reduction is different from the reduction methods
based on attribute dependency in related works. In future
work, integration of different reduction methods will be
studied to solve the problem about combinatorial
explosion of context attributes. It is also necessary to
study the incremental construction algorithm to
implement dynamic updating of QFML.
