Abstract— Individual protection, physically or mentally, is 
very important for someone living in a risk environment. 
Insurance is one of the individual protections due to accident,

critical role in providing competitive product insurance that 
covers flexible features depend on customer requirements. In 
order to compete with other competitors and fulfill the 
customer needs, the company needs a wise and proper 
business strategy. The insurance company needs extra 
knowledge on the potential customer whom can give a positive 
response to the insurance product being offered. In this paper 
we proposed an associative classification model to develop a 
knowledge model for determining the best class solution for 
insurance policy dataset. We enhanced the classification-based 
association of associative classification by using a heuristic to

I. INTRODUCTION
Individual’s protection is very important both in physical 
or mental form when living in a risk environment. Insurance 
is one of the individual protections that cover a person from 
problem such as accident, blaze, critical diseases or death. 
Insurance company plays a critical role in providing 
competitive and flexible insurance product that covers 
customer requirements. Currently with a number of 
insurance products in the market and in order to be able to 
compete with other competitors, insurance company needs a 
wise and proper business strategy. Knowledge in identifying 
potential customers whom will give positive response to the 
product being offered is crucial and will benefit the 
company. The knowledge may in terms of a specific pattern 
on customer characteristics that always buy on certain 
insurance products. This knowledge can improve the 
company revenue resources if they use in the right way. 
They may offer more friendly services to customers. The 
quality of the decision can be improved and this will give a 
positive impact to the company. To get knowledge and 
quality information, data mining can be applied to the 
insurance industry. This technique is widely used in various 
domains such as medical, marketing, banking and science in 
supplying useful and quality information.  
In this study, one of the data mining techniques, the 
associative classification approach will be used to find 
interesting relationship and frequent pattern in insurance 
data. An association rules mining is a well-known approach 
in generating huge number of rules. The discovered rules 
then will be transformed into the classification rules. The 
generated rules can be used to assist the company in 
expanding their business by offering more competitive 
insurance products and reducing insurance cancellation rate. 
Also, it can focus on the potential customers whom capable 
of buying insurance and maintaining the insurance. This 
brings profits to customers and the company. Therefore, this 
technique offers a huge benefit to company insurance in 
expanding their business segmentations. The insurance data 
used in this study are obtained from an insurance company 
in Malaysia and it contains 200,000 records with 74 
attributes. These records contain customer data such as 
name, age, race, religion, premium amount, policy status, 
and address of the policy holders. There are often a huge 
number of association rules discovered in a data mining 
practice, making it difficult for users to identify those that 
are of particular interest to them. Therefore, it is important 
to remove insignificant rules and prune redundancy as well 
as summarize, visualize and post-mine the discovered rules. 
Moreover, the information obtained from traditional 
association rules are very limited, so new forms of 
association rules are needed to discover useful and 
actionable knowledge.  
This paper is organized into five sections. The related 
work of associative classification model and insurance 
domain will be discussed in section II. Section III and IV 
present the main methodology of our associative 
classification modeling and experiments. Finally, section V 
concludes the work in this paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Associative classification is a data mining approach of 
using association rules mining to construct a classification 
model. This approach is commonly employed when there 
are a vast amount of data and a lot of information need to be 
1481978-1-4244-8136-1/10/$26.00 c©2010 IEEE
discovered from the data. It also used when the actual class 
of the data is uncertain to the researcher and post mining of 
association may support the identification of appropriate 
attributes. There are several techniques in associative 
classification as discussed in [1] such as the Classification 
based on Predictive Association Rules (CPAR),
Classification based on Multiple Association Rules 
(CMAR), Multi Class classification based on Association 
Rules (MCAR), and Multi Label Associative Classification 
(MMAC). The main functions of these algorithms are 
employing different rule discovery, rule ranking, rule 
pruning, rule prediction and rule evaluation methods. 
 Recently, the data mining technology has been 
supporting the statistical techniques in solving business 
problem. In particular, data mining improves the existing 
predictive models by investigating the new form of rules 
that are more meaningful and interesting. The predictive 
models that are able to predict the behavior and relationship 
among data will strongly support the process of decision 
making thus enhanced the quality of company’s strategic 
planning and business intelligence [2]. The main challenge 
in sustaining a business is to increase the number of new 
customer and to fulfil various customer needs. Recently, the 
term business intelligence used in business is commonly 
associated with data mining. In business intelligence, 
satisfying the customer needs is the main aim of a company. 
Thus, a company needs to investigate and do research on 
how to strategize their products in fulfilling these needs. In 
insurance industry, companies are aggressively offering 
various insurance products to attract customers. 
Understanding the demographic and cutomer personal 
profiles leads to a new view in setting and offering better 
products. The policy holder interests in having more than 
one insurance policies is higher than obtaining a single 
policy only [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Therefore, it is good for a 
company to plan for a new insurance product that support 
various customer needs to make the customer financially 
managable. Indirectly, the company gains more profits in 
retaining the customer with that special policy product.  
In this study, we propose a data mining approach called 
associative classification to discover important association 
and relationship within large amount of insurance dataset. 
These data associations will be processed using the 
classification-based association (CBA) technique [1] where 
important knowledge model is obtained. The knowledge 
model will be analyzed further and based on the developed 
model, the strategic decision is proposed. 
III. METHODOLOGY
The associative model development involves four 
important steps: i) Data collection and preprocessing, ii) 
Association Rules Mining (ARM), iii) Association Rules 
Post-Mining, and iv) Associative Classification Model 
Development. 
A. Data Collection and Preprocessing 
The insurance policy holders and products data are 
collected from the Malaysian Insurance Company contains 
about 200,000 records. The data consists of 74 attributes 
about the insurances policy and policy holder profiles. There 
are five types of insurance products offered such as 
Dynamic Asia Capital Protected (DACP), Group Mortgage 
Reducing Term Assurance (GMRTA), Hire Purchase 
Reducing Term Assurance (HPRTA), Medic Freedom
(MEDF2) and FD Freedom (PEFD1). Table I shows the 
attributes involves in each insurance product.

The preprocessing stage involves data cleaning, data 
reduction and data transformation [9]. The purpose of data 
cleaning stage is to handle the missing values and to smooth 
out the noises. This is important to ensure a consistent 
dataset for further mining processes. The continuous valued 
attributes are transformed into categorical values and 
reduced to limited categories to ensure the efficiency of the 
mining process. The main challenge in preprocessing the 
data was to perform a data reduction process where several 
identified attributes have to be removed. These attributes 
were the redundant attributes, key attributes and attributes 
with low data distribution. During the data reduction 
process, many redundant attributes have been identified and 
removed from the data set. This leaved eight most relevant 
attributes. 
B. Association Rules Mining 
In this study we propose an Apriori Algorithm for the 
association rules mining to find association within the 
insurance data. The apriori algorithm generates the frequent 
patterns of the data prepared in the form of transactions 
[10]. It generates rules and these rules will be further 
processed in the post mining stage. Apriori algorithm 
generally performs two important tasks; generation of 
frequent pattern candidates and generation of rules [9].  
The rules generated during this process can be measured 
in terms of the confidence and support value measurement. 
The support value measures how frequent an item occurs 
and the confidence value measures the strength of the 
generated rules. The minimum value of support (min_sup) 
and confidence (min_conf) are predetermined to control the 
quality and the amount of generated rules. Various threshold 
values are suggested for both measures [10, 11, 12]. In this 
study the initial min_sup was set to 10% and the initial 
min_conf was set to 80%. Several different minimum 
support and confidence values were used in the experiments 
to ensure the generated rules represent many frequent cases 
and attributes. The consistent values of min_conf and 
min_sup indicated the obtained rules are consistent and 
reliable. 
The Apriori algorithm was run on the insurance dataset 
based on individual product. The results from our initial 
experiment indicated that the best initial min_support and 
min_conf obtained were 10% and 80% respectively. 
Therefore, these initial measures were used on the other 
different products data. Table II shows the example of 
association rules generated from the DACP insurance 
product. Five sets of association rules from each product 
were generated and the rules were further analyzed in the 
next stage of the experiment.

C. Association Rules Post Mining 
Association rules mining often discovers a huge number 
of rules and it is difficult to interpret and to select the most 
interesting rules. This situation such as rules redundancy 
will always occurs. Therefore, it is important to remove 
insignificant rules and prune redundancy as well as 
summarize, visualize and post-mine the discovered rules. 
The generated association rules are further analyzed to 
identify the appropriate class attribute for associative 
classification. Four post mining steps are adapted in this 
study: i) removing the redundancy in association rules, ii) 
summarization and generalization of association rules, iii) 
clustering the association rules and iv) creating associative 
classifier. The association rules mining are filtered by 
identifying the redundant rules where some rules can be 
subsumed by other rules. The summarization and 
generalization of rules involves searching for rules that 
satisfy certain minimum confidence. In this study, the 
minimum confidence is determined by simulating series of 
confidence values to find one suitable values to be the 
threshold confidence. This work is tedious and time 
consuming. Finally, the frequency of the attributes at the 
antecedent of the rules is computed and the potential class 
attribute with the highest frequency will be considered as 
the class attribute. In this study, the insurance product name 
is focused to be the potential class and therefore the 
associative classifier was obtained using this attribute.

D. Associative Classification Model Development 
Association rules mining have shown interesting 
findings in discovering interesting rules in data. Recently, 
the association rules have been actively used for effective 
classification. This is due to their corresponding 
associations that have an interesting relationship between 
attribute condition and class attribute. In this study, we used 
the classification-based association (CBA) approach that 
uses an iterative approach to frequent itemset mining [1,9]. 
In general CBA was empirically found to be more accurate 
than C4.5 on a good number of dataset [9].  
We enhance the CBA by introducing a heuristic to 
construct the classifier with the following steps: 
Step 1: Organize rules in decreasing precedence based on 
confidence and support. 
Step 2: If a set of rules has the same antecedent, then the 
rules with highest confidence   is selected to 
represent the set. 
Step  3: Classify the test data using the first rule method. 
Step 4: Classify the test data on correctly classified and 
uncertainly classified. 
Step 5: Verification of uncertainly classified rules by expert. 
Step 6: Construct the knowledge model based on classified 
and the verified uncertainly classified rules. 
IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Experimental Setup 
In this study, we used datasets from five types of 
insurance product: Dynamic Asia Capital Protected (DACP-
4564 records), Group Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance 
(GMRTA-29854 records), Hire Purchase Reducing Term 
Assurance (HPRTA-8729 records), Medic Freedom 
(MEDF2-5922 records) and FD Freedom (PEFD1-2444 
records). The initial threshold values of min_sup and 
min_conf of every product were determined from our initial 
parameter settings that were 10% for min_sup and 80% for 
min_conf. However, various parameter settings were still 
being used to ensure the stability of the selected parameters. 
Various sizes of rules were obtained from these parameters 
settings. The association rules mining towards the five 
insurance product has produced many rules with various 
confidence values and the combination of items. The total of 
1818 rules were generated for the DACP product, 1044 
rules for GMRT product, 2409 for the HPRTA product, 
2252 with MEDF2 product and 628 rules for PEDF1 
product. For each generation of association rules, the 
interesting and strong rules were determined for 
summarization and generalization of association rules. The 
strong rules are obtained by determining the difference 
between the confidence value of the rules and the minimum 
confidence value.   
The strong and interesting rules (that obtained after the 
post mining stage) are defined as the rules that have 
confidence ranges between 80% to 100%. In this study we 
obtained 14 rules from DACP, 13 rules from GMRTA, 11 
rules from HPRTA, 11 rules from MEDF2, and 9 rules from 
PSFDI insurance products. Later, we filtered again all the 
rules together and obtained three interesting rules from each 
product. Therefore for the classification model, we obtained 
15 association rules. Table III depicted the association rules 
generated for insurance product profile data. The next 
section will discuss how the associative model is 
constructed from these association rules. 
B. Results 
We used the generated rules for testing the accuracy of 
the associative classification rules. The testing is conducted
by reconstructing the rules. In the rules reconstruction, the 
consequent part of the rule is the product class and the 
existing consequent becomes the antecedent. All rules were 
used to test the unseen cases and the classification accuracy 
was recorded. The total of one hundred test data was taken 
from all products classes where 20 data from each class 
were selected. These data were the unseen examples that not 
been used for mining. A simple voting procedure was used 
for classification. The experimental results were noted by 
the percentage of correct classification and uncertain 
classification.  
The uncertain classification indicates that the records are 
uncertainly classified by having more than one product 
class. In this case the uncertain classified records were 
further analyzed to verify whether these records could also 
be classified with other product class. If the verification is 
true then, the consequence part of the rules is added with the 
selection of two or more products. In this study, the 
experimental results obtained 58% correctly classified 
records and 42% uncertain classified records. The rules that 
contributed to the uncertain classified records were then 
investigated by the insurance experts and are verified 
whether it is possible to offer more than one product with 
the same cases. Therefore, the associative classification 
rules obtained from this study is showed in Table IV. The 
insurance experts verified that the generated rules indicated 
that the company could offer a combination of products or 
an alternative product to the potential customers. For 
example, the insurance company can offer either product 
DACP or GMRTA if the applicant fulfils the condition in 
R1.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an associative classification 
approach to develop a knowledge model for insurance 
product selection decision. We enhance the CBA algorithm 
by introducing a heuristic in processing the extracted rules. 
Two types of rules are observed i.e. rules obtained from the 
correctly classified data and rules constructed from the 
uncertain classified data. The uncertain classified rules are 
constructed by considering the decision made by the 
classification rules and by the original data decision. Policy 
product expert verified these rules and the rules with 
alternative decision are obtained. The knowledge model 
obtained in this study is yet to be employed in the full 
working system.  
To conclude in business term, the insurance company 
can offer more than one different plans in one policy or a 
clustered insurance policy. For example, customer can have 
both life and car insurance in a single policy. This will give 
the value added to insurance product as well as the company 
sustainability. The product will be more competitive and 
flexible to the customers.
