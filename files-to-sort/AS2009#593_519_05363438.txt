Abstract—Software defects are the key factors to evaluate the 
dependable software. This paper analyzes the attributes of 
software defects, and applies positive and negative association 
rules method to the research of software defects. This method 
can not only overcome the weak point of the traditional 
association rules method that can only mine the explicit rules, 
but also output some more meaningful rules of relationship of 
attributes. We extract the exterior relationship among the 
attributes of software defects, and fully mine the rules of inter-
attributes. Through the application of the "Design and 
Implementation of Mining Linkage Management System of 
Coal Mine", the experimental results demonstrate that our 
mined rules have the advantages of less quantity, higher 
quality, fewer errors and conflicts.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In the process of software development, the accumulation 
of software defects is the main reason of dependable 
software target. At present, the analysis of defects data is 
relatively weak in general, it generally provides some simple 
statistical function of the defect attributes, and users have to 
use some other analytical methods to analyze the defect data. 
These methods mainly include regression analysis, Bayesian 
network, and neural network etc. However, these methods 
can not fully mine the defects data that contain valuable 
information, and can even induce misleading analysis results. 
What's more, as a result of analytical methods, management 
technique and application fields are different; defects 
quantity and the relationship among attributes are different. 
Therefore, choosing different methods maybe lead very 
different analysis results. 
In view of the above issues, the paper studies thoroughly 
the analytical method and technology of software defects’ 
attributes based on the positive and negative association 
rules. This method can make up deficiencies in the study of 
the relation of defects’ attributes. Positive and negative 
association rules could mine a lot of associated realizations 
and derivative realizations of data item sets. It could find the 
relationship of the defects’ attribute though association rules 
method [1]. However, the increasing in the number of 
defects will certainly result in a sharp rise of the search space 
of data mining algorithm and the possibility of blind 
discoveries. So we must attempt to use domain knowledge to 
mine relationship and rules of non-frequent defects’ attribute 
sets, design the more efficient mining method in order to 
improve the efficiency of mining rules. Therefore, the study 
of positive and negative association rules method is very 
significant. 
II. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION RULES  
A. Algorithm of Positive and Negative Association Rules 
Traditional association rule algorithm is only used to 
discover positive association rules, that is, it only can 
discover the explicit model with high frequency and strong 
correlation, such as A?B. In fact in the database, there are 
still a lot of implicit model which can not be found by 
current mining techniques, such as A?¬B, ¬A?B, ¬A?
¬B[4], these important implicit models are negative 
association rules which having the properties of low 
frequency and strong correlation. These implicit rules tell us 
data items which rarely occur together, but they have very 
strong correlation, including valuable information. 
Compared to positive association rules, negative association 
rules can expand the state of the affair item sets; they can not 
only mine the relationship between explicit attributes, but 
also be able to mine the relationship between explicit and 
implicit attributes 
B.  The Calculation of Correlation of Positive and 
Negative Association Rules 
Negative association rules can find the problems which 
the positive association rules can't, but the contradictory 
association rules might be induced in the process of mining. 
The reason is the existence of the negative correlation 
contained between the item sets [2], the other possibility is 
independent between item sets, but the application of 
statistical correlation can effectively solve this problem. The 
positive and negative association rules is defined in the 
literature [3], in which the correlation of item sets A and B 
was expressed as follows: corrA,B=s(A?B)/s(A)s(B). 
Three possible measurements of corrA,B are as the 
follows: 
If corrA,B>1, Then A and B are positive correlation; 
978-1-4244-4507-3/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE
If corrA,B=1, Then A and B are independent of each 
other; 
If corrA,B<1, Then A and B are negative correlation; 
It is easy to show that the correlation of the four 
association rules between A and B have such relationship as 
follows: If corrA,B>1, then corrA,¬B<1, corr¬A,B<1,corr¬A, 
¬B>1, the reverse is also true. Therefore, when mining the 
positive and negative association rules, the appearance of 
contradiction rules will be avoided as long as the correlation 
of item sets is judged. That is, When corrA,B>1,it is  just 
need to mine the rules of A? B and ¬A? ¬B; when 
corrA,B<1, it is  just need mine the rules of ¬A?B and A?
¬B; when corrA,B=1, no rules need to mine. 
After judging the correlation of item sets, all kinds of 
rules between item sets will be mined according to the 
formula of the support and confidence of positive and 
negative association rules. 
C. The Calculation of Support and Confidence of Positive 
and Negative Association Rule 
Support and confidence are two important measurable 
indicators in the positive and negative association rules. The 
definition is as follows: 
Let I={ 1 2, , mi i i" }be a set of items, let D be a 
transaction data set, where each transaction T is a set of 
items with T?I, A transaction T is said to contain A, a set of 
items in I, if A?T. An association rule is an implication of 
the form "A?B" where A?I, B?I and A?B=F. The rule A?
B has a support supp in the transaction set D if s% of the 
transactions in D contains A?B.  The support of the rule is 
the probability that A and B hold together among all the 
possible presented cases. It shows that: 
 supp(A?B)=s.count(A?B)/|D|=|{T|A?B?T,T?D}|/|D| 
That s.count (A?B) contains the number of A?B, |D| the 
panel said that the number of  D. 
It is said that the rule A?B holds in the transaction set D 
with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain A 
also contain B. The confidence of the rule is the conditional 
probability that the consequent B is true under the condition 
of the antecedent A. 
conf(A ? B)=supp(A ? B)/supp(A)=s.count(A ?
B)/s.count(A)= | {T|A?B?T, T?D} |/| {T|A?T, T?D} || 
Given D, The concourse of item sets satisfy minsupport 
which are given by users is frequent item sets. The problems 
of association rules are finding the association rules which 
satisfy the minconf that are given by users form frequent 
item sets. 
Negative association rules contains item sets does not 
exist (non-existing-items, for example ¬A, ¬B), Calculating 
their support and confidence directly is more difficult. 
Theorem 1: if A, B?I, A?B=F, then 
• supp(A)=1-supp(¬A) 
• supp(A?¬B)= supp(A)- supp(A?B) 
• supp(¬A?B) = supp(B)- supp(A?B) 
• supp(¬A?¬B) 1-supp(A) -supp(B)+ supp(A?B) 
Corollary 1: if A, B, T, A?B=F, then  
• conf(A? ¬B)=(supp(A)-supp(A?B))/ supp(A)=1- 
conf(A?B) 
• conf(¬A?B) =(supp(B)-supp(A?B))/ (1-supp(A)) 
• conf(¬A ? ¬B)=(1-supp(A)-supp(B)+supp(A ?
B))/(1- supp(A))=1- conf(¬A?B) 
Corollary 1 is used to calculate the confidence of 
negative association rules [4]. 
III. THE APPLICATION OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE 
ASSOCIATION RULES IN THE SOFTWARE DEFECTS ANALYSIS 
A. Unary Data and Multiple Data 
Unary data analysis is analyzing one defect attributes. 
Multiple data analysis is analyzing two or more defects’ 
attributes. 
Unary data analysis is only to get one attribute 
distribution of software defects, but the gotten information is 
limited, and it is generally expressed with histogram, pie 
chart and other visualization tools. But the distribution of 
multiple-defect attribute values is usually better reflect the 
software process and technical problems than the distribution 
of a single defect attribute values in the analysis of software 
defects [5]. Therefore, the distribution of multiple-defect 
attribute values and the association relationship among the 
attributes are often revealed by the analysis of multiple data. 
B. The Application of Positive and Negative Association 
Rules in Multiple Data Analysis 
Characteristics of software defects include the following 
eight attributes: activities of defects finding, defects 
consequence, defects trigger, defects target, defects lifecycle, 
defects origin, defects type and defects determiner [6]. Here 
we use data mining method to analyze the defects in "Design 
and Implementation of Mining Linkage Management System 
of Coal Mine" which been developed  by ourselves; we have 
chosen three attributes form the characteristics of software 
defects ,that is," activities of defects finding (Activity)", " 
defects origin (Origin)" and "defects type (Type)". Their 
meaning and value are shown in table I [7]. 
We obtain part database D of defects as shown in table II. 
Let minimum support minsupport = 20%, the smallest 
confidence minconf = 40%, we mine rules to database D 
respectively through Apriori algorithm and positive and 
negative association rules method. 
1) Mining rules from database D  through Apriori 
We can obtain candidate item sets from database D of 
defects through Apiori algorithm. Item sets is shown in table 
III and table IV. The steps are as follows: Firstly, we simply 
statistic analyze the frequency of each element in item sets  
and identify item sets whose minimum support is not less 
than 20%, here we get item sets D1. Secondly, we repeat the 
first step and obtain the second candidate item sets D2. 
As shown in table IV, these rules are mined by the 
algorithm of positive association rules, such as the third rule 
indicates that large numbers of activities of defects finding 
originate from the encoding phase. The twenty-fourth rule 
indicates that more algorithm defects are introduced in the 
encoding stage, etc.

2) Further extracting rules from item sets L2 through 
positive and negative association rules 
On the basis of the item sets D2 in table IV, we use the 
formula of the correlation of positive and negative 
association rules to calculate as follows: 
• For the item sets GL, 
corrG,L=s(G?L)/s(G)s(L)=0.3/0.6*0.3=0.86<1. 
This indicates GL is a negative correlation, so 
mining rules only have G?¬L and ¬G?L, Then the 
confidence of positive and negative association rules 
can be calculated as: conf(G?¬L)=1>minconf, 
conf(¬G?L)= 0.67>minconf, Therefore G?¬L and 
¬G?L are all effective negative association rules. 
• For the item sets CG, 
corrC,G=s(C?G)/s(C)s(G)=0.2/0.6*0.7=1.43>1. 
This indicates CG is a positive correlation, so mining 
rules only have C?G and ¬C?¬G. Then the 
confidence of positive and negative association rules 
can be calculated as: conf(C?G)=1>minconf, 
conf(¬C?¬G)=0.75> minconf, Therefore, C?G. is 
an effective positive association rules and ¬C?¬G 
is an effective negative association rules. 
• For the item sets JI, 
corrJ,I=s(J?I)/s(J)s(I)=0.6/0.6*0.7=1.11>1.This 
indicates JI is a positive correlation, so mining rules 
only have J?I and ¬J?¬I ,  Then the confidence of 
positive and negative association rules can be 
calculated:conf(J?I)=0.33<minconf,conf(¬J?¬I)=
0.75>minconf. Therefore, J?I is invalid association 
rules and ¬J?¬I is an effective negative association 
rules. 
• For the item sets JL, corrJ,L=s(J?L)/s(J)s(L) 
=1.Therefore, JL notes independent of each other, no 
rules. 
Other item sets can be discussed in the same way.

3) The experimental results 
• From the above analysis we can see that the defects 
rules sets which been mined through Apiori 
association rules have fraudulence to some extent, 
such as for item sets JL, support 
(H3A2)=30%>minsupport=20%,confidence(H3A2)=6
0%>minconf=40%. Here the minsupport and 
minconf are all meeting. However, if we calculate 
through positive and negative association rules, we 
will find the JL item sets are independent of each 
other, do not have rule, that is, the type of interface 
defects and the type of algorithm defects are 
independent of each other. 
• Table V shows the number sets of defects rules that 
calculated through the Apiori and positive and 
negative association rules. We can see that the 
number of positive association rules calculated 
through positive and negative association rules 
algorithm is less than Apiori algorithm, it shows that 
a number of conflicting rules are removed, but also 
mined a lot of negative association rules, which 
indicates the effectiveness of positive and negative 
association rules.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have discussed positive and negative 
association rules method based on positive association rules, 
and it has been applied innovatively in analyzing the 
relationship between the attributes of software defects. 
Compared with positive association rules, positive and 
negative association rules can expand the affairs item sets. 
This method can enhance the credibility of the software 
because it can mine not only the relationship of frequent 
defects’ attributes sets, but also mine the rules and data 
which contain valuable information of non-frequent defects’ 
attributes sets. Through the analysis of test results in "Design 
and Implementation of Mining Linkage Management System 
of Coal Mine ", we have extracted the exterior relationship 
among the attributes of software defects, and fully mined the 
rules of inter-attributes. Compared with the general 
association rules, this method has the advantage of excluding 
some conflicting rules of defects and improving the accuracy.
