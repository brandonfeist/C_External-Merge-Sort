Abstract-the information revolution and network applications 
bring new business opportunities to enterprises, financial sector 
industry characteristics determine its On-line business have 
much interests. The reality is that the financial sector high cost of 
On-line finance, the cost of settling large number invalid 
customer information. Growing customer should be the focus of 
attention by On-line finance, the application of information 
technology, to solve efficiencies in cost accounting effectively and 
identify activity for customer growth characteristics and 
behavior patterns by mining association rules does great help for 
the right On-line financial firms, while growing customer can get 
personalized service and monitoring. This long-term 
development of financial enterprises is an important protection 
of their interests.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Since the 90s of last century, along with the breakthroughs 
of networking, communications and information technology, 
Internet explosive growth in the global and rapidly spread, in 
this context, the financial network also came into being. 
The so-called network of finance, also known as e-finance, 
refers to achieve financial activities on the Internet, including 
the network of financial institutions, Internet financial 
transactions, networks financial markets, financial regulation 
and so on. It differs from the traditional physical form of 
existence financial activities, the existence is electronic space, 
their existence is a form of virtualization and the operating 
mode is a network-based. Online financial services Web site 
created precisely in response to an e-commerce trend. 
Online financial Web site as a whole system is divided into 
system platform and application systems at two levels, which 
system platform including network, computer and system 
software, application system is dealing with business logic. 
Within this overall architecture, the application systems were 
divided into channel layer, the core business layer and the 
agency business gateway layer. Channel layer provides mobile 
phone short message, wap, web and telephone service centers 
and many other financial services channels; the core business 
layer provides financial information services and financial 
transaction services; agency business gateway layer provides

Significance of the existence E-finance industry's value­
added business should be achieved through electronic financial 
services. However, two problems can not avoid are staged from 
time to time behind the Chinese online financial Web site: First, 
such a large investment to achieve electronic information in 
banks, then why banks line up everywhere? Second, such a big 
investment in many security measures, strengthen the network 
of banks all the necessary facilities, and within two years from 
2008 to the present, the number of e-banking accounts rose 100 
times, while there are 80% of the personal e-bank account was 
frozen like or basic precipitation? 
At present, China Bank's business processes based on 
internal management and internal accounting needs, lack of 
scientific customer segmentation and target customer location. 
Place a long time philosophy around the "capital-centered" 
thinking not the "customer-centered", What we see is the face 
of the wave of the impact of information technology, financial 
services variety of new services marketing activities have been 
continuously developed and attract customers eye-intensive; 
we do not see is that a waste of resources and ineffective use of 
information behind the eye, and the heavy capital expenditure 
and ongoing maintenance costs remains high. Therefore, the 
real concerns to growth customers to the bank lead to 
continued profitable, tap the effective conduct of their 
information and give a very specific service is a realistic choice 
sustainable development for an online financial website. 
II. INFORMATION MINING TECHNOLOGY AND ASSOCIATION 
RULE 
Network information problem have a very important and 
far-reaching impact both for public utilities or private 
company's strategic planning. General, the network shortest 
path between any two points is defined as the length of the 
distance between two points. If a point on the network to the 
rest of the maximum distance from the point of the smallest, 
then the point is known as the center, if the point to the rest of 
points and the minimum distance, the point is known as the 
median (center). In this paper we focus on median problem. If 
the problem is to strive for in the n-point networks to find k 
points, making it a point to the rest of the k-point distance and 
minimum, this problem is well-known as k-center (k-median) 
median problem; it has proven the problem is NP-hard. 
Mettu and Plaxton established and studied the online 
median location issues in 2003. The output of their model is a 
sequence to be located and to ensure that each k-sequence of 
pre-order the costs all with the corresponding k-median 
problem close to the optimal solution cost. Specific 
performance metrics is to use competitive ratio algorithms to 
measure, the competitive ratio as small as possible. Since the 
model is proposed, it is subjected to the attention of a growing 
number of management scientists, operations research and 
computer scientists, but little further research. Article in the 
Mettu and Plaxton, they proved that a metric space is busy 
central location problem the lower bound of competitive ratio 
2 __ 2 _ is n - 1 , where n is the number of points, which is now 
the best known lower bound results. 
Information is the basis for mining customers, customer 
information management problems is how to get large amounts 
of data they need from the information, especially the 
information policy makers they need, data mining technology 
is currently more popular theories. For the data mining (DM, 
data mining), a more accepted definition of W.JFrawley, 
G.Piatetsky-Shapiro and others made: the data mining is the 
data from large databases to extract interest knowledge. This 
knowledge is implicit, potentially useful information to extract 
the performance of the concept of knowledge (concepts), rules 
(rules), rules (regularities), pattern (patterns) and other forms. 
The more general argument is: Data mining means find 
patterns in the decision support process that in some of the 
facts or a collection of observation data. It is a mass data using 
a variety of tools found in the relationship between model and 
data process. 
People's data applications laid from low-level the query to 
provide support for the decision-making in information mining 
technology. Many mining nature problem can be translated into 
equivalent classification. Classification, clustering, forecasting, 
correlation analysis is for the completion of different tasks at 
different levels and developed by means of technical 
applications. Classification can be described as follows: a large 
number of samples constitute the input data set, that is, the 
training set. Each sample has several attributes, including 
attributes and can be a continuous attribute, it can be discrete 
attributes. There is a property known as the class attribute is 
used to indicate the sample belong classification. 
Correlation data exist in the database is an important 
knowledge that can be identified, the purpose of association 
analysis is to identify hidden off the database closed network , 
which can help enterprises understand the linkages between 
customers to buy goods, then select the appropriate marketing 
strategy. 
The basic concepts of association rules as follows: 
se/ = (ip ... in) is a collection of items. D is a collection of 
database transactions, where each transaction T is a collection 
of items, making T C I . A set is a collection of items, if 
588 
A ? T ,so that means T contains A . An association rule is 
one of the form A implies B Chong-style, 
where A ? I , B ? I and A (I B = 0 . Each association rule 
includes two important features, namely, support and 
confidence. The support describes the use of association rules; 
confidence describes the reliability of association rules. 
Association rules can be found in a variety of association 
rules from a lot of customer data to help the online financial 
Web site customer segmentation, cross-service, etc. The rule in 
the information mining get growing, this is because the real 
characteristics of economic activity determined. Today, with 
the rising frequency of commercial activities also full of 
personal expression, unexpected choices and unpredictable 
factors also get growth at the same time. First, all of these 
groups there is no fixed pattern of thinking; stress is placed on 
a variety of factors to meet the immediate feelings of mixed 
level; individual choice, while full of contradictions on the 
available options, were unable to clarify the path of thinking. 
Any associated factors that could cause such customers do not 
have the choice of high-quality follow-up of sexual behavior. 
III. GROWTH CUSTOMER CHARACTERISTICS OF 
INFORMATION AND BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS 
Today, the study of the customer profit contributions are 
two factions: the causes school and results school. The causes 
school major research contribution to customer profitability 
formation mechanism and influencing factors; and the results 
school is based on historical trading data to evaluate the 
customer profit contribution. The causes school study focused 
on a number of non-financial indicators of the impact of 
customer profit contribution, such as customer satisfaction on 
financial performance; the results school of the customer profit 
contribution laid in the research performance model for the 
customer profit contribution. Berger, and Nash had a series of 
customer profitability model to calculate the specific 
circumstances of the customer profit contribution, but the 
authors did not provide these customers profit contribution 
model of empirical analysis. Mulhem proposed a model for 
calculating a customer's current profit contribution, this model 
is designed for direct sales, in the calculation of customer 
profitability degrees, considered only the direct marketing 
costs. Wayland and Cole summed up the customer profit 
contribution calculation methods; take the former a degree of 
customer profitability as a customer basis for next profit 
contribution. In the relationship marketing and customer 
relationship management, a common practice that all current 
projections have not yet achieved the lifetime value of 
customers and in accordance with the value of the size of the 
sort for each plan period, according to resource-constrained 
businesses as large as possible to customers as an enterprise 
focus on the examination object as much as possible the value 
of choice, using this approach, enterprises can ensure the 
maximization of future profits. Rakesh and Gupta proposed the 
calculation of real-life customer profit contribution model. 
While Yang Yong-heng proposed a concept of formula to 
predict the potential customer profit contribution. 
The above scholars mainly aimed at real-life customer 
profit contribution made a number of calculation models and 
formulas, but little studied growing customer recognition and 
retention provide an important basis for decision making to be 
able to maintain a lasting strategy for enterprise customers. 
Growth customer has been continued to tap the available 
capacity of profits, and the different levels of the group 
demonstrated an overall expansion trend in a long period of 
time, future development is expected. Measure customer 
growth behavior is a very complicated and difficult matter, not 
only because it needs time and space, quality and quantity to 
examine, the more difficult is that customer growth is a highly 
integrated and dynamic concept of development that can not be 
unified approach and a single indicator to measure. We can 
measure the client's growth benefit from business growth of 
GEP examine ways. 
The basic principle of GEP is to determine the status of 
each index value and the standard score, based on the 
assessment of the first measurement period of one year before 
the online customer, the average value of each index and to 
determine the average score. Study clients the reality of the 
situation in the past (before the evaluation period 1 year), and 
then an index measuring customer class comparison score the 
real value of the indicator based on customer evaluation period; 
Study the target customers in the same class (or all) position, 
thus re-calculate the target customer (the whole) to compare 
scores with the former an average score ratio; study the index 
clients measurement throughout the period, the growth of the 
state, and finally the ratio sum of each index reached a 
comprehensive growth index, reflecting the overall growth of 
the financial status of customers. 
In this paper, we choose customer transaction records and 
background information as raw data, in its pre-process 
operations based on the expert knowledge and experience in 
the field, through the statistical analysis of customer 
transactions generated can be used to describe the behavior 
patterns of the original features of groups, these primitive 
features customer trading patterns of behavior should be 
inherent in the essence of the important properties. The growth 
is no doubt that such acts customers showed steady growth in 
the statistical sense, the performance of its data path for the 
upward divergence. 
IV. GROWING CUSTOMER DATA MINING AND 
CORRELA nON MODELS 
Using GEP method, usually the customer growth is set to 
quantitative indicator system A (A system) and qualitative 
indicators of the system B (B system). A systematic evaluation 
model study the customer growth from a quantitative 
perspective whether the growth has economic sense, we must 
continuously examine its dynamic state of development. Thus, 
A systematic evaluation model judged by two-dimensional 
evaluation method, that is space and time, at the same time 
examine a continuous period of time in which the position and 
rate of growth and quality. The specific method is: first 
determine the overall situation of groups of customers are 
located, and then calculate a number of years before the 
589 
evaluation period (typically 3 years) growth conditions 
(including changes in customer class status and changes in 
customer's own state), the final evaluation period the actual 
level of the growth of the previous status of a number of years 
and then compare the final evaluation period as a whole to 
reflect the growth status of clients. 
If we inspected a customer in the A system, then the client 
index value of the actual scores and the average score values 
of P Ai and PAt in the evaluation period are: 
PAi = Did + (ZiS -Zid) /(Zig -Zid) X (Dig -Did) 
PAt = Dtd + (Ztm -Ztd) /(Ztg -Ztd) x (Dtg -Dtd) ; 
PAi : Customers index value actual scores a number of 
years before evaluation period; PAt: Customers average index 
score value a number of years before evaluation period; Zis : 
customers actual value of indicators in the evaluation period; 
Zid: customers actual value of indicators where the lower 
Z. range of values in the evaluation period; 19 : customers actual 
value of indicators where the maximum range value in the 
evaluation period; Did: customers lower values correspond to 
D. 
the standard index score in the evaluation period; 19: 
customers maximum index value of the corresponding standard 
score in the evaluation period; Other values are the average 
evaluation indicators of the corresponding period. 
Taking into account the client's perception changes, then 
the above equation can be deformed as follows with the 
introduction of Cognitive Theory on the proliferation-related 
cognitive theory: 
pn 
= 
n?l X 
dN(t) . pn 
= n?l X ? dN(t) Ai P Ai d(t) , At PAt f:t d(t) . 
Based on the analysis of the cognitive information behavior, 
behavioral model of the proliferation of quantitative research is 
as follows: 
dN(t) 
= p(m-N(t))+ q
N(t) (m-N(t)) 
d(t) m , Among them, 
P is the coefficient adoption of direct behavior 
(O<p<l)q .  h . . .. ffi· - - ; IS t e transmiSSIOn cogmtIve coe IClent 
( 0 :0:::; q :0:::; 1) . m is the final adoption of the biggest acts of 
the number of possibilities. N(t) is a cumulative number 
people to adopt cognitive behavior. 
Therefore, we can calculate and evaluate the actual scores 
and the average score values PAi values 
PAt a number of years 
before the target period, to calculate the customer evaluation 
period D Ai actual scores and average scores D At according to 
the weight of individual indicators, 
n dN(t) n-I dN(t)

B system is the indicator described qualitative indicators, 
measurement whether the amount of customer growth from the 
qualitative point of view, we must examine the most important 
impact of customer growth in cognitive, interpersonal 
relationships and behavior patterns of internal and external 
environmental factors, while ensuring that participating in the 
evaluation targets can be established between the organic link, 
reflecting the perception of the main characteristics of 
customers. 
In order to find meaningful association rules, we need to set 
two thresholds: minimum support and minimum confidence. 
The former association rules under which the user degree of 
support must meet the minimum, it is that a group of objects 
set in the statistical sense of the need to meet the minimum 
level; the latter, the user-defined association rules must satisfy 
the minimum credibility, it reflects the minimum reliability of 
association rules. Taking into account the online financial Web 
site placing our clients into different customers with the size of 
the assets of, our clustering method used here to determine the 
actual index scores and adjacent changes in the relevance of 
different clients. 
The basic steps of Clustering fusion algorithm of are as 
follows: 
Step 1: for a given n mode 
Xi , the first of each model as a 
kind Wi 
= (Xi) set the number of clusters C = n . , ,
Step 2: When C ?: 1 , repeat the following steps 3 through 5; 
Step 3: using a suitable similarity metric scales and rules to 
determine the most similar to two clustering Wi and Wj ; 
W 
w .  w.. = (w.,w .) 
Step 4: Merge i and J, lj I J ,  in order to get a 
number of categories for the C -1 of the clustering solution; 
Step 5: C values decrease. 
In the clustering process, we must select the appropriate 
measure of similarity scale and connectivity rules based on 
characteristics of the data distribution and mode, and rules 
590 
according to different scales of clustering will produce 
different clustering results. In this paper, Euclidean norm and 
Ward method are used as clustering of specific criteria. 
V. THE PROCESS OF GROWING CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION 
For the online financial Web site owned by the customer 
name, customer account and other indicator, we form a 
feature vector with the optimal behavior patterns described in 
customer transactions. These models will be presented to the 
established pattern recognition classifier that is associated with 
the use of established decision-making on the pattern 
classification to generate a different pattern class. Carried out a 
relatively fixed pattern of behavior of their ideas in accordance 
with the normal customer transactions generally, with similar 
identity of the customer should have a similar and consistent 
with its status, so behavior patterns of transactions have 
similarity transactions of similar behavior patterns of 
customers. 
Obtained through the clustering algorithm pattern class 
representing the different types of customer transactions 
behavioral patterns of transactions with similar characteristics, 
if the same pattern class in a customer has with the class of the 
other clients similar to identity, then the view that the Client 
trading activity is a normal trading patterns; otherwise, then 
that the client transactions deviating from normal patterns are 
unusual trading patterns, consider the appropriate level of 
attention to the degree. 
Through the use of pattern recognition technology to 
customer transactions to identify behavior patterns, analysis 
and monitoring, in order to effectively discover customer 
growth. Identification process is shown in Figure 1.

Accordance with the "branch and bound" algorithm for 
selection of these original features to form a lower dimension 
of the optimal and most efficient characteristics of groups, each 
client are based on the optimal feature vector to describe their 
trading behavior. After searching, we can assume the average 
daily transaction value (D 1), the average monthly trading 
frequency (D2) and the average monthly frequency of cash 
transactions (D3) formed combination of growth characteristics 
of customer behavior patterns as the optimal characteristics of 
groups. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND ANALYSIS 
This Paper use information identification technology 
associated with the field of online financial Web site clients to 
identify online trading and analysis through customer behavior 
patterns, to identify null and void customers the frequency of 
deviation from the normal behavior of network transactions, 
and vice versa is our growth customers are looking for. 
Theoretical analysis shows that the financial sector application 
of this method can effectively identify transaction patterns of 
behavior consistent with their status of growing client. For the 
feature selection problem, "branch and bound" algorithm can 
guarantee the optimal combination of features, but the 
computing cost a relatively large amount. In the recognition 
process associated with the use of information from the 
bottom-up fusion algorithm, we can avoid the recognition 
process of the user-defined parameters, sensitivity and 
dependence to improve the recognition of non-supervisory. 
The associated recognition technology has some significance 
for monitoring growth of the unusual nature of customer 
transactions to identify unusual trading patterns of behavior 
with the non-growing client or invalid client.
