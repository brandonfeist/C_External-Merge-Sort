Abstract- The teaching appraisal must be done every semester 
in most of the universities. There are large amounts of data 
accumulated. In order to find out the relevance between 
individual background of a teacher and his teaching 
performance, this thesis introduces an algorithm based on 
multidimensional Association Rules Mining, which has 
explored teaching defects when there are the individual 
differences and use the verdict to guide teachers' work. 
Keywords-Data Mining; Association Rules; Teaching 
Appraisal; Support; Confidence 
I. INTRODUCTION 
For the rapid development of information technology, 
the teaching of Computer, Electronics etc. forms its 
distinguishing features. Because of the rapid update of the 
relevant knowledge, the teachers are required to have special 
ability, such as profound basic knowledge, practical 
experience, strong capability to accept new knowledge and 
quickly master the cutting-edge knowledge etc[1]. 
This article describes an Association Rules Mining 
algorithm, which is used to find the relevance between 
individual background of a teacher, such as age, position or 
education, and his teaching performance. It aims to discover 
the potential impact on the teaching consequence when there 
are the individual differences, with the purpose to guide 
teachers' work 
II. THE CONCEPT OF ASSOCIATION RULES MINING 
The Association Rules is one of the basic tasks of Data 
Mining, and it is used to determine the links between the 
different domains. That is to find the interesting connections 
based on the given data sets. 
Given a set of items I = (I), 12 ... 1m) and a transaction 
database D = (t), t2'" 10), in which, ti = (Ii), li2 ... lim) and lij E 
I. The Association Rules is the implication of X ? Y. In it, 
X and Y are items sets, respectively, and X n Y = <I> [2]. 
To find the interesting Association Rules, two parameters 
Support and Confidence need to be defined. Support of X 
? Y is a percentage that shows the degree that X U Y is 
occupied in the all transactions of the database. Confidence 
means the ratio to the transactions containing X U Y and the 
transactions containing X, and it is a measurement of the 
accuracy of Association Rules. In fact, people are only 
interested in some Association Rules that meet the minimum 
degree of Support and Confidence. Therefore, in order to

find meaningful Association Rules, two thresholds need to 
be offered, which are MinSupp and MinConf [3]. 
Confidence (X ? Y) = sup port count(X u Y) (1) 
sup port _ count(X) 
III. THE PREPARATION FOR THE DATA 
Here collected 80 teachers' personal information and the 
appraisal data of their teaching, which were made by the 
students of one college of Information & Technology. The 
teacher's information is composed of education, job title and 
age. Education is subdivided into Bachelor, Master and 
Doctor. The job title is subdivided into Teaching Assistant, 
Lecturer, Associate Professor and Professor. Ages are 
subdivided into three different ranges: under 30, 31-45 years 
old and above 45 years old. The appraisal of teaching is 
subdivided into the following items (shown in Table1). 
Table2 is the result after data discretization. For the 10 
appraisal items, because the aim is to find the unsatisfactory 
items rather than the good performance items, the appraisal 
items below 85 points are discreted into value I, which 
indicates that the appraisal results are unsatisfactory. The 
otherwise is value 0 that shows the items excellent. For 
example, the case of teachers No.1 is older than 45 years, 
Doctor and Associate Professor. In the 10 appraisal items of 
his teaching, E I is excellent, E2 is imperfect . . .  E9 is 
imperfect and E 10 is excellent.

IV. ALGORITHM ANALYSIS 
A. The teacher classification 
Before finding the Frequency Sets, the teachers have 
been classified according to their personal information. All 
the 80 teachers have been divided into 36 kinds of types. 
For example: «30 years old, bachelor, Teaching assistant) 
is type 1, «30 years old, bachelor, lecturer) is type 2 . . .  and 
so on, (> 45 years old, Doctor, professor) is type 36.

To make the classification, a teacher is determined to a 
certain type after scanning the distribution of value 1 among 
the columns of age, education and title of every row in table2. 
Later the classification numbers can be filled in the 
classification column. For example, the teacher No. 1 
belongs to the 35th category, and teacher NO.2 belongs to 
the 22nd category. Similarly, the teacher No.80 belongs to 
the 5th category. 
The algorithm is shown as below. 
Set 4 arrays: Age(n,3), Edu(n,3), Protitle(n,4), and 
ClassifY(n). Here, n is the number of teachers to be 
classified , Age(n, 3) is used to store the ages of the teachers , 
Edu (n,3) is used to place their education situation, Protitle (n, 
4) is used to store their job title situation , ClassifY (n) is used 
to store the classification results. For example, as shown in 
Tablel, to the teacher NO.1 (> 45 years old, Doctor, 
Associate Professor), the appropriate storage of his situation 
in the arrays is :Age (1,1) = 0, Age (1,2) = 0 Age (1,3) = 1; 
Edu (1,1) = 0, Edu (1,2) = 0, Edu (1,3) = 1; Protitle (1,1) = 0, 
Protitle (1,2) = 0, Protitle (1,3) = 1, Protitle (1,4) = O. 
For i = 1 To n 
fenlei(i) = "" 
For j = 1 To 3 
If Age(i, j) = 1 Then 
fenlei(i) = fenlei(i) & Str(j) 
For k= 1 T03 
If Edu(i, k) = 1 Then 
fenlei(i) = fenlei(i) & Str(k) 
For m = 1 To 4 
If ProTitle(i, m) = 1 Then 
Fenlei (i) = fenlei (i) & Str(m) 
End If 
Next m 
End If 
Next k 
End If 
Next j 
Next i 
The time complexity of the algorithm T(n) = O(n) and 
the space complexity of the algorithm Sen) = O(n) 
B. Finding the frequency sets 
In this research project, Support is set 10%. The wanted 
frequency sets are some subsets that are composed of the 
same type of teachers whose Support is more than 10%. The 
process to find frequent sets is as follows: in Table2, count 
the rows according to different classification numbers in 
classification column and delete those sets whose proportion 
is below 10%. The removed parts indicate that the quantity 
of this kind of teacher is too small to be a representative set. 
The detail of the algorithm is as follows. In it, the number 
36 represents the classification number and the standard 
classification numbers are stored in array Iei(i). 
For i = 1 To 36 
For j = 1 to n 
If lei (i) = fenlei (j) Then 
Sumlei (i) = sumlei (i) + 1 
End If 
Next j 
If sumlei(i)/n < 10% Then 
Sumlei (i) = 0 
End If 
Next i 
C. Generating the Association Rules 
In this project, the aim is to find the unsatisfactory 
appraisal items of certain types of teacher, so a lower 
confidence level 40% is set. The process to generate the 
Association Rules is: for each frequency set generated in 4.2, 
its 10 teaching appraisal items are calculated in order and 
the results have been filled in Fig.l. Shown in Fig. l, if the 
Confidence of one appraisal item greater than or equal to 
40%, it indicates that the teacher's teaching has problems. 
The experimental result has been shown in Fig. I.

If sumlei (i) < > 0 Then 
For j = 1 to n 
If flag(i, j) = 1 Then 
For k= 0 To 9 
sumping(i, k) = sumping(i, k) + EvaG, k) 
Next k 
Fork=O To 9 
sumping(i, k) = sumping(i, k) / sumlei(i) 
If sumpingl(i, k) < 0.4 then 
sumpingl(i, k) = 0 
End If 
Next k 
End If 
Next j 
V. ANALYSIS OF THE CONCLUSION 
In Figure 1, the El to EIO columns of a row show the 
appraisal result of a teacher and the Number column shows 
the teacher's classification type. The char "#" means this 
appraisal item no problem, on the contrary, the greater value 
means the more serious problem of this appraisal item. It can 
be seen from Fig.1 that most of the 10 teaching appraisal 
items are unsatisfactory of the first kinds of teacher, and it is 
also the same of the 17th, the 18th and the 30th kinds of 
teacher. From the vertical view, the E6 and the E7 appraisal 
items are dissatisfied. Similarly, the E3 and E4 appraisal 
items are also unsatisfactory [4]. 
VI. SUMMARIES 
This paper discusses how to find the defects in teaching 
by using Association Rules. The data used in this paper are 
real and reliable. The conclusions generated by this 
algorithm can be used to reveal defects and also can be used 
as guidance for improving teaching quality [5].
