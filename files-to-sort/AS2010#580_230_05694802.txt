Abstract—There are two shortages in usual methods for 
agricultural land evaluation: (1) too many manual 
interferences into the calculating procession; (2) the relatively 
large differences of partial units are concealed in certain 
factors. We designed a hypergraph clustering model in this 
paper based on fuzzy frequent itemsets to conduct the 
evaluation  for quality of agricultural land. The database for 
land units is composed with the fuzzy feature vectors. It 
executes the mining association rules to the fuzzy itemsets 
given by the definition of evaluation factors,  and analyzes the 
clusters with the HMETIS segmentation method, finally 
devises the transactions similarity function to cluster the 
services. With the following checking example in some region 
in South China, it not only determines the quality rating of 
each units of agricultural land, but also gives the quality 
description for each grade.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The substance of evaluation for agricultural land 
management is a process of analyzing the information of 
agricultural land quality(production conditions), 
determining the evaluation criterion and hierarchizing the 
analysis. When applying the factor method in the 
agricultural land evaluation, it might be possible that the 
defects of a certain condition would be concealed by the 
advantages of some other factors, but this kind of defects 
could be the sill which restricts the quality of farmland. 
In this paper we design a method which composes 2 steps, 
establishing the hypergraph model and clustering data based 
on hypergraph. Firstly, the transaction database is 
constructed from the evaluation units database. During this 
process, we set index description of evaluation factor as an 
data item, and express it as a vertex in hypergraph. The 
correlated items would be connected by weighted 
hyperedges. A hyperedge represents a relationship in the 
subset of evaluation units data. The weight of hyperedge 
shows the intensity of the relationship. Then applying the 
hypergraph partitioning algorithm to cluster the vertexes, 
and we will get the corresponding index for evaluation 
factors-clusters of items. Finally, these items from the 
cluster is used to describe the cluster which the transaction 
belongs.(Fig. 1)

Among which |D| is the transaction number of database

The attribute value of agricultural land units might be 
continuous or discrete. We need to apply the fuzzy sets 
theory to create the membership function for each attribute, 
and change attribute data to the dimensionless items which 
show the monotonically increasing tendency. The 
continuous property membership data is divided into 
several intervals. Each interval composes a subset of the 
certain property which called a fuzzy itemset. If the 
supporting degree of the fuzzy itemset is higher than the 
setting threshold, this itemset is called a fuzzy frequent 
itemset. Mining the association rules according to the fuzzy 
frequent itemsets would be agreeable to show the fuzzy 
phenomena in the land quality of evaluation units.  
B  Constructing the model 
It is assumed that there are m evaluation units of 
agricultural land in a certain region?n evaluation factors, 
the index data with multi-resource of evaluation unit i is 
defined as Xj? j=1…n?? (xi1 x?i2 …? x?in). A membership 
function of each evaluation factors is established in the 
discussed area, which subjects to Yj=j? X?? j=1…n .? And 
the value of membership from each index of factors for a 
evaluation unit is derived. Getting yij =j?xij??Yi=?yi1?
yi2?…?yin?is regarded as the fuzzy feature vector of 
evaluation unit Xi. The transaction database is composed by 
the fuzzy feature vectors. 
For a weighted hypergraph H=? V E? (?Fig.2), vertex set 
V is constituted of fuzzy itemsets, and hyperedge E is 
composed of fuzzy frequent itemsets. A hyperedge is 
expressed by a fuzzy frequent itemset, and the weight of 
each hyperedge is defined as the average value of all the 
main association rules’ credibilities of the hyperedge. The 
main association rule is a formula which includes all the 
items of hyperedge and there is only one item on the right 
side. The way to get the main association rules will be 
introduced behind. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
III. ASSOCIATION RULES AND THE MINING 
ALGORITHM 
A  mining algorithm of Association rule 
Mining association rules is aimed at obtaining all the 
association rules which satisfy the minimum supporting 
degree-Minsupport and the minimum credibility- 
Minconfidence. Firstly all the frequent itemsets in dataset D 
can be quickly searched according to the minimum 
supporting degree, then the association rules will be get 
from the frequent itemsets and the minimum credibility. 
B  Generation of association rules 
After mining all the frequent itemsets in the dataset, the 
strong association rules which satisfy the minimum 
supporting and credibility can be produced. The specific 
operating introductions is followed: for each frequent 
itemset 1 to generate all the non-empty subsets of 1, if  
 
 
We get an association rule s =>(l - s) a?mong which sup 
por _ count(l) is the number of transaction records which 
contained itemset 1?sup port _ count(s) is the number of 
transaction records which contained itemset s?min_ conf is 
the threshold of minimum credibility. The association rules 
are directly produced by the frequent itemsets, therefore all 
the itemsets that involve in the rules will satisfy the 
threshold of minimum supporting degree. 
IV. TOP-DOWN HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING 
ALGORITHM BASED ON HYPERGRAPH 
Hypergraph partitioning algorithm HMETIS is applied in 
the cluster analysis which belongs to divisive hierarchical 
clustering methods. HMETIS is a efficient layered 
hypergraph partitioning algorithm. It divides the vertices of 
hypergraph into k parts which are roughly the same and 
makes the least number of hyperedges which connect 
different parts. 
A  Item clustering-the classification of fuzzy frequent  
items for evaluation factors 
To purify the division results, we need to eliminate 
meaningless classes at first. Higher quality value of class 
implies that the inside edge of division has a greater weight. 
If the quality value of class is higher than the setting 
division threshold, the clusters are considered to be fine. 
It is assumed that e represents a vertex set of hyperedge. 
The standard for measuring whether division c is good or 
bad is defined as follows: 
 
 
After obtaining the good division, we need to check the 
vertices in the division and filter those vertices which are 
not strong correlated with others. The vertex with high 
correlation value shows it has many edges which connect

with other vertices .If the correlation value of a vertex is 
higher than the given threshold, the vertex would be  
considered that it belongs to the division, or the vertices 
would be eliminated from the division. The correlation 
function of vertex v is defined as follows: 
Re levancy(v, c) |{e | e c,v	e} | / |{e | e 	c} | 
After purifying the division by the 2 standards above, we 
can get high quality division of the vertices, in other words, 
the clusters that fuzzy items belong. 
B  Transactions cluster-evaluation units classification 
The hypergraph clustering model constructed in this 
paper is clustering the transactions of evaluation units by 
clustering the items of evaluation factors. That is to say, the 
description of the transactions clusters can also belong with 
the data items of factors in the classification. And we can  
decide which the cluster that evaluation units belong to 
through computing the similarity between transactions and 
clusters.

V. FARMLAND QUALITY EVALUATION OF HESHAN 
CITY 
According to the natural and economic attributes of 
farmland in Heshan City, we make comprehensive 
assessments for the farmland quality and divide the results 
into several grades. In this case, 10 factors are chosen to be 
analyzed (Table I). The land polygons act as the evaluation 
units which come from the land use database with the scale 
of 1:10000. There are 7149 evaluation units in the database.

A  Creating the hypergraph clustering model for farmland 
quality evaluation 
1) Constructing transaction database 
The farmland evaluation units are taken as the 
transactions in the cluster analysis. Firstly, the membership 
functions of each evaluation factor are established. Then, 
the factor index values of all the evaluation units are 
substituted into the membership functions of each factor.  
Therefore the membership value can be obtained according 
to the index value, the transaction database is successfully 
established.  
2) Mining fuzzy frequent itemsets 
K-means algorithm is applied in the cluster analysis for 
the membership value of evaluation factors for the 
threshold-type farmland transactions. The clusters’ interval 
range is determined by the distribution of data. Fuzzy data 
itemsets of continuous evaluation factors are established 
which the number of the items is the number of clusters. 
For those discrete evaluation factor, the fuzzy items are 
divided according their index value.?Table II?

All the evaluation factors are divided into 48 fuzzy items.

farmland units, the maximum possible total number of 
fuzzy itemsets in the transaction database would be: 
C16* C14* C15* C14* C14* C16* C14* C15* C17*C13 = 4838400 
Assumed that the minimum supporting degree 
minsup=0.01. There are 15552 frequent itemsets mined by 
the Apriori algorithm. The credibility of main association 
rules can be computed. 
3) Constructing the hypergraph clustering model for 
farmland quality evaluation based on fuzzy itemsets 
Constructing a weighted hypergraph H=? V E??? vertex 
set V is composed of 48 fuzzy itemsets from all evaluation 
factors, hyperedge E is the fuzzy frequent itemset, and the 
total number of the hyperedges is 15552. The weight for 
each hyperedge equals to the average value of all the main 
association rules’ credibility. 
Setting the evaluation results number 4 as the given 
cluster number, that is to say, existing a segmentation N 
which can evenly divide the hypergraph H into 4 relatively 
independent subdivisions H1?H2?H3?H4 approximately, 
means that there are 4 data cluster classes. We establish 
evaluation function f=       ?among which Ws  is the 
weight of hyperedge?es E? ? linking vertices between 
different subdivisions. Then a segmentation is searched 
which obtaining the minimum can be function value, so that 
making the sum of correlation value between each 
subdivision to the least. 
B  Cluster analysis based on fuzzy frequent itemsets 
1) Item clustering 
Purifying the division with the HMETIS algorithm?and 
the standards is designed for quality and correlation 
function. Then we can get the clustering results for the 
fuzzy items of farmland quality evaluation factors. (TableIII)

Summarizing the descriptions for index range of each 
cluster’s data items, we could tell the characters of each 
cluster and determine the corresponding quality rating of 
the cluster. 
2) Transaction clustering 
The weighted similarity computing formula is applied in 
this part, which use the similarity between transactions to 
determine the cluster that evaluation unit belongs, among 
which the weight value is the impact weight of each 
evaluation factor?TABLE IV?. At last, substituting the 
property membership value of each farmland unit into the 
formula, we can get the quality level of each unit.?TABLE

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
The substance of target item clustering is that it definites 
the range or value for the factors of a certain type or level 
agricultural land. This kind of evaluation ideas are more in 
line with the characters of agricultural land use type which 
can avoid the defects that factors offset each other brought 
by the factor analysis method. 
Establishing the corresponding relationship for the index 
range and clustering results from a certain group or some 
groups of correlated evaluation factors, we can fully reflect 
the leading role of the main evaluation factors act in 
determining the unit’s level. At the same time, each cluster 
(level) would have an explicit description which is very 
meaningful in the agricultural land quality evaluation and 
land suitability evaluation.
