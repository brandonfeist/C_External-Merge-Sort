Abstract-In this paper, data mining technology is applied 
to study on dependency relationship between height and main 
feature points of body. The association rules are extracted by 
using Linear Regression algorithm. Before scanning feature 
points, the location of each feature point is predicted by data 
mining technology, and then feature points are scanned 
preferentially within corresponding locations. This will greatly 
reduce the search range offeature points; thereby enhance the 
efficiency of photogrammetry.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In fashion design, pattern design, in order to better fit 
the body, it is important to study the proportion of the 
human body, size, structure and other information. Only 
deeply study the data of body, can pattern design be 
processed suitably. Garment designed and made to 
individual specifications demands to obtain 
anthropometry data. The convenient and fast methods of 
anthropometry are a focus in garment made-to-measure 
field [1]. Photogrammetry is typical case which first 
obtains the contours of the human body from few 
photographs, then detects feature points in the contours 
and finally calculates the body size of various parts on 
the basis of rules derived from statistical analysis of 
mass anthropometric data. The technique of detecting 
feature points is the key step in procedure of human 
photogrammetry. The efficiency of feature point 
identification determines the efficiency of the human 
body photogrammetry. In this paper, data mining 
technology is applied to study on dependency 
relationship among the feature points. The rules between 
them and the height are extracted. This will greatly 
reduce the search range of feature points; thereby 
enhance the efficiency of photogrammetry.

2.1. Designing Model of Data Warehouse

In our study, nine feature points are selected which 
are associated with many size of the human body III 
vertical dimension. They are defined as follows [2]: 
• vertex: the highest point of the first top 
• cervical height: point of the seventh spinous 
process tip of cervical vertebrae 
• acromion: the most prominent point located at the 
lateral border of the acromion 
• anterior armpit: the most under endpoint of the 
pectoralis major, located in the front split of armpit 
• fossa jugularis: the midpoint on the straight-line 
portion connected to two sternal end of clavicle 
• thelion: the center of the nipple 
• waist height: the vertical distance from waist line to 
ground 
• hip height: the vertical distance from hip line to 
ground 
• knee height: the vertical distance from knee line to 
ground. 
According to research purposes, logical model of 
anthropometric data warehouse is built, which can be 
used to uncover and predict hidden patterns between 
nine feature points and the height. The logical model of 
this data warehouse consists of one data table named 
Survey, which is defined as Fig 1:

Fig. 1. Logical Model of Anthropometric Data Warehouse 
After the data collection, data cleaning and 
transformation are completed, there are 259 samples in 
the data warehouse which are anthropometric data of 
male and scattered throughout China. 
2.2. Selecting Tool of Data Mining 
There are hundreds of data mining tools and softwares. 
In our study, we selected Microsoft SQL Server 2005 as 
the data mining tool. Microsoft SQL Server Analysis 
Services contains the features and tools which can create 
complex data mining solutions. A set of industry­
standard data mining algorithms meet the demand of 
study. The function module of Data Mining Designer 
can help user to create, manage, explore, and create 
predictions from mining models [3]. 
The Microsoft Linear Regression algorithm is a 
typical algorithm which is a variation of the Microsoft 
Decision Trees algorithm, where the 
MINIMUM_LEAF _CASES parameter is set to be 
greater than or equal to the total number of samples in 
the dataset that the algorithm uses to train the mining 
model. When the parameter is set in this way, the 
algorithm will never create a split, and therefore 
performs a linear regression. 
Linear regression can be used to determine a 
relationship between two continuous columns. The 
relationship takes the form of an equation for a line that 
best represents a series of data. For example, the line in 
the following diagram is the best possible linear 
representation of the data [4]. 
449 
Fig. 2. Diagram of Linear Regression 
The equation that represents the line in the diagram 
takes the general form of y = ax + b, and is known as the 
regression equation. The variable Y represents the output 
variable, X represents the input variable, and a and bare 
adjustable coefficients. Each data point in the diagram 
has an error associated with its distance from the 
regression line. The coefficients a and b in the regression 
equation adjust the angle and location of the regression 
line. The regression equation can be obtained by 
adjusting a and b until the sum of the errors that are 
associated with points reaches the lowest number. 
In our study, we use linear regression to uncover and 
predict hidden patterns between height and 9 feature 
points. 
2.3. Model Building of Data Mining 
Model building is the core of data mining, though it is 
not as time-and-resource-intensive as data 
transformation. Only the type of data mining task is 
completely understood, it is relatively easy to pick the 
right algorithms. According to our study purpose, linear 
regression algorithm is suitable.

In indicating column usages, which columns we 
specify as input and which as predictable are shown in

2.4. Model Assessment of Data Mining 
Lift chart is a popular tool to evaluate the quality of a 
model, which uses a trained model to predict the values 
of the testing dataset. Based on the predicted value and 
probability, it graphically displays the model in a chart. 
Lift chart shows the overall performance of the model 
across all possible target states. In this version, a line 
coordinate indicates how many predictions would have 
gotten correct by the used model. The ideal line here is 
at a 45-degree angle, indicating that if the data had used 
50%, about 50% of the population would have been 
correct, or if the data had used 100%, the population 
would have been correct all the time. The random guess 
line is based on the most likely state discovered in the 
training set.

Lift charts of every column are similar, of which lift 
chart of waist height column shown in Fig 4 is an 
example to demonstrate the accuracy of mining model. 
2.5. Prediction 
Prediction is also called sconng m data mmmg 
tenninology. To give predictions, a trained model and a 
set of new cases are need. In our study, finding patterns 
is just half of the work; the final goal is to use these 
models for prediction. 
The Mining Model Prediction Builder pane allows 
building and editing prediction queries. In order to 
demonstrate the predicting function only two columns 
are selected to predict. The results are shown in TABLE

3. CONCLUSION 
This paper describes the application of data mining to 
anthropometric surveys for gannents. Our study 
uncovers and predicts hidden patterns within the data of 
body feature points. From figure 5, we can draw a 
conclusion that there is dependency relationship between 
height and 9 feature points. As we mentioned at Section 
D, the relationship can give us ideal prediction. We can 
predict the position of the 9 feature points according to 
the height. 
Fig. 5. Dependency Network 
The conclusion can be used to detect feature points of 
body. Before scanning feature points, the locations of 
each feature point are predicted by data mining 
technology, and then feature points are scanned 
preferentially within corresponding locations. This will 
greatly reduce the search range of feature points; thereby 
enhance the efficiency of photogrammetry.
