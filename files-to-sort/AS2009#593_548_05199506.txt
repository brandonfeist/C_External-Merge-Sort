Abstract—IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay task standard includes 
two mutually exclusive options: transparent relay stations (T-RS) 
and non-transparent relay stations (NT-RS). In this work, a 
system design approach is proposed to compare different relay 
systems in term of their capacity with rate fairness constraint 
among the Mobile Stations (MS). Single-Input Single-Output 
(SISO) and Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) antenna systems 
are considered in the links between the Base Station (BS) and 
Relay Stations (RS). 1 and 3 RSs per sector are considered. Our 
simulation results show that for any case, the highest capacity is 
achieved by NT-RS with 3 RSs per sector in distributed 
scheduling mode. In addition, the effect of the MS association 
rule, which determines the access station (BS or RS) for each MS, 
is also investigated. Two rules: Highest MCS scheme with the 
highest Modulation and Coding Rate, and Highest (Mod) ESE 
scheme with the highest (modified) Effective Spectrum Efficiency, 
are studied along with the optimal rule that maximizes system 
capacity with rate fairness constraint. It is demonstrated that 
Highest (Mod) ESE scheme performs closely to the optimal rule in 
term of capacity.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Systems based on IEEE 802.16 OFDMA standard (mobile 
WiMAX, or 802.16e) [1] is one of the leading candidates for 
4G wireless networks. Mobile WiMAX is designed to provide 
high data rate to mobile users with Quality-of-Service; 
however, initial field trial of mobile WiMAX system has 
limited coverage and poor service for indoor users as well as 
users at cell boundaries. Using relay station (RS) is a well 
known method to extend the coverage of the base stations in 
cellular systems. IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay standard [2] has 
been developed as an extension to the 802.16e OFDMA system 
for coverage extension and capacity enhancement with full 
backward compatibility to the 802.16e mobile stations (MS). In 
802.16j relay system, relay station serves as a relay node 
between the multihop-relay BS and the MSs. The radio link 
originates from or terminates at an MS is called access link; 
while the BS-RS link is called relay link. 
Two modes of PHY layer operations are defined in 802.16j: 
transparent relay mode and non-transparent relay mode. In 
transparent relay mode, a transparent RS (T-RS) does not 
transmit control signals including frame-start preamble, FCH, 
UL/DL-MAP and DCD/UCD. Instead, a MS that access the 
network through a T-RS depends on the BS for these control 
signals. In non-transparent mode using a time-division transmit 
and receive relay (TTR) mechanism, a non-transparent RS 
(NT-RS, or TTR RS) transmits all the control signals as well as 
data packets like a regular BS to the MS. T-RS and NT-RS 
have different and incompatible frame structures and hence 
present mutually exclusive options: transparent relay system 
and non-transparent relay system (denoted as T-RS and NT-RS 
as well). In addition, a NT-RS can operate in either centralized 
or distributed scheduling mode if the transmission schedule of 
the RS is generated by the BS (centralized) or the RS itself 
(distributed); clearly, a T-RS can only operate in centralized 
scheduling mode. For NT-RS, in this paper we only consider 
distributed scheduling mode. 
It is important to understand the benefit and limit of each 
option. Based on methodologies specified in [3, 4], a system-
level simulator is introduced in [5] for multi-cell 802.16j multi-
hop relay systems. Also, performance is compared in [5, 6] 
through simulations for these options of 802.16j two-hop relay 
systems, in terms of network coverage and system capacity 
with assumptions on relay link for simplification. This paper is 
the further work on capacity analysis and resource allocation. 
The resource allocation problem in 802.16j relay network 
has been studied in [7–11]. It is demonstrated in [7] that in 
802.16j multi-hop relay system, 1 or 2 RSs per sector can 
improve the per-cell uplink (UL) throughput (e.g., by 25% or 
38% with 90 data users per cell, respectively). RS deployment 
and resource reuse strategies for 802.16j multi-hop relay 
system are investigated in [8, 9]. It is shown that using RSs 
with resource reuse among all RSs can substantially improve 
the system capacity. In [10], system performance is evaluated 
for 802.16j multi-hop relay networks with both conventional 
and its proposed spectrum efficiency based adaptive resource 
allocation (SEBARA) method. Simulation results show that 
SEBARA outperforms the conventional one in terms of 
throughput, delay and packet loss. In [11], several heuristic 
scheduling schemes for a WiMAX-based OFDMA system 
have been compared in term of throughput and delay.  
In this paper, we study and compare the capacity of the two 
different 16j relay systems through joint resource allocation

and user (MS) balancing under the user rate fairness 
requirement. Special attention is paid to the MS association 
rule in determining the access station between the BS and the 
RSs. We carry the study in the downlink (DL) direction of two-
hop systems where a MS connects to the BS through at most 
one RS; the same schemes apply to the UL direction as well. 
We first propose a system design approach to evaluate the per-
user throughput and total system capacity. Then the maximum 
capacity among different frame partition is obtained for each 
type of 802.16j system, and compared with the BS-only system 
(802.16e) used as a baseline. The effect of increasing the 
number of deployed RSs per sector, and the usage of SISO or 
MIMO in the relay links are also investigated. Furthermore, for 
each 802.16j relay system with rate fairness constraint, two MS 
association rules are compared with the formulated optimal rule 
that achieves the maximum capacity among all the association 
rules and frame partitions. The effective spectrum efficiency 
(ESE) is used in T-RS networks, and is further modified to 
account for the aggressive frequency reuse in NT-RS networks. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the 
802.16j relay system models. Section III first gives our 
proposed system design approach for capacity analysis of each 
relay system with certain MS association rules under the user 
rate fairness constraint, and then evaluates and compares their 
resulted capacity with respect to different relay systems and/or 
MS association rules. Section IV summarizes the paper.  
II. FRAME STRUCTURES AND SYSTEM CONFIGURATION 
A. Frame Structure of Two-hop Relay Networks  
1) Transparent Relay Frame Structure: Fig. 1 shows the 
frame structure when T-RSs are used [2]. 
 
Figure 1.  Frame structure for a two-hop transparent relay system [2]. 
DL subframe is partitioned into DL Access Zone and 
Transparent Zone. DL Access Zone can be further partitioned 
into BSMS zone and BSRS zone, where the BS sends out data 
bursts to the RSs and the MSs, respectively. Transparent Zone 
is also denoted as RSMS zone in which a RS forwards data 
bursts from the BS to its MSs. The BS and the RSs will never 
transmit in the same frequency segment simultaneously (we 
ignore the case of cooperative TX diversity where BS and RS 
transmit to the same MS), therefore no cross interference exists 
between transmission from the BS and the RSs. The R-RTG 
gap allows the RS to switch from RX mode to TX mode and its 
length is set 2 symbols. 
2) Non-Transparent Relay Frame Structure: Fig. 2 shows 
the frame structure when NT-RSs are used [2]. DL subframe is 
partitioned into Access Zone and Relay Zone. In DL Access 
Zone (BSMS, RSMS zone), the BS and RSs transmit data 
bursts and control signals to the MSs simultaneously, using the 
same or different frequency segments. In DL Relay Zone 
(BSRS zone), the BS sends data bursts to RSs for forwarding 
to MSs in the next DL Access Zone. BS’s Access Zone is 2 
symbols longer than a RS, because of the gap (R-TTG, set as 2 
symbols) a RS needs to switch from TX to RX mode.

B. Network Configuration and Simulation Results 
Table I lists some parameters of our 1/3/3 system. One slot 
is one subchannel by two symbols for DL PUSC [1]. For 
demonstration purpose, the entire frame is assigned to DL. 
TABLE I.  DL WIMAX PARAMETERS. 
Parameters Value

Number of Sectors per Cell 3 
Frame duration (DL) 5 ms 
Number of OFDMA Symbols 47 
Sub-channels 30 
Slots per Frame (S) 705 
 
RSs are placed evenly in each sector at the ¾ cell radius. 
The topology of BSs and RSs in T-RS and NT-RS is the same 
except that a T-RS shares the same frequency segment as its 
BS; while a NT-RS may use a different segment than its BS 
and its peers in the same sector. Fig. 3 shows the frequency 
patterns in center cell for NT-RS with 1 or 3 RSs per sector. 
Each color represents a different frequency segment. The DL 
CINR distribution for MSs in the center cell has been obtained 
through simulation. Details of the simulation results have been 
reported in [5].  
On the relay link, both SISO and MIMO are simulated, 
producing different spectrum efficiency (SE). Note the same 
relay link results apply to both T-RS and NT-RS systems. The

quality than other RSs. The DL CINR distribution of the SISO 
relay link is shown in Table II, along with the SE and required 
SNR at receiver for different Modulation and Coding Scheme 
(MCS). In SISO cases, for 1 or 3 RSs per sector, the SE of 
relay link is 4.20 and 3.69 bit/symbol/subcarrier, respectively. 
In MIMO 2×2 case, the spectrum efficiency is found to be 1.6-
times that of SISO case [12].

C. General Notations 
S, x, y and z are the size of a frame, BSMS, RSMS and 
BSRS zone, respectively. xi and yi are the corresponding sizes 
for MSi if applicable. The size of each zone can be adjusted to 
one of all feasible sizes defined by the protocol. DS represents 
the resource for two symbols. From Table I, S = 705, DS = 30. 
M is the number of RSs per sector. N, N0, N1, …, NM are the 
number of total MSs, MSs served by BS and RS1, …, RSM, 
respectively. I, I = {1, 2, …, N}, is the set of all MSs. I0, I1, …, 
IM are the set of MSs served by BS and RS1, …, RSM, 
respectively, which form a partition of I such that I0 ?? ... IM  = 
? (empty set) and I0 ?? ... IM  = I. ri, ri, 0 and ri, j are the SE of 
MSi if i ? I, I0 or Ij, j = 1, …, M, respectively. Rj is the SE of 
RSj in BSRS zone, j = 1, …, M. And si is the assigned resource 
in total for MSi. The capacity is C, C = f(r, I0, I1, …, IM). 
D. MS Association Rules 
The MS association rule determines how a MS chooses its 
access point (BS or RS). For simplification, each MS can only 
choose between the BS and at most 1 candidate RS. 
1) Highest MCS scheme: the BS or RS that provides the 
highest MCS level on the access link to the MS is chosen as 
the MS’s access station.  
2) Highest (Mod) ESE scheme: each MS picks the BS or 
RS with the strongest (modified) effective spectrum efficiency 
(ESE) as its access station. 
ESE is defined as the ratio of the end-to-end throughput and 
consumed resources. Then, for MSi in T-RS, the ESE is

3) The Optimal scheme: it maximizes the system capacity 
among all MS association rules under rate fairness constraint.  
III. CAPACITY ANALYSIS IN 2-HOP RELAY SYSTEMS 
We now analyze the system capacity under the user data 
rate fairness constraint. Each MS within the cell is provided 
with a similar date rate irrespective of its access station. 
Consequently the total resource used by a MS is inversely 
proportional to its ESE. The system capacity is then defined as 
the number of users per cell times the minimal per-user rate. 
A. Capacity in 2-Hop Transparent Relay Systems 
Fig. 4 describes our capacity analysis algorithm in T-RS 
under the user rate fairness constraint. It can be used to analyze 
the system condition with arbitrary frame partition or MS 
association rule, or to search for the optimal point under the 
user rate fairness constraint. Note x ? DS, y ? 0 and z ? 0.

The optimal frame partition ps is achieved at:

It is clear that the capacity C is maximized when each MS 
chooses the access station with the highest ESE.  
Fig. 5 shows the per-user rate in the 1-hop and 2-hop links 
of T-RS for Highest MCS scheme and Highest ESE scheme, 
respectively. Four cases are considered: 1 or 3 RSs per sector, 
SISO or MIMO in relay links. In Fig. 5(a), the per-user data 
rate increases in 2-hop links while decreases in 1-hop links; 
MIMO case has slower decreasing speed due to better relay 
links than SISO case. Compared with 1 RSs case, 3 RS case 
has worse relay links, better RS-MS links and more MSs under 
RSs; and their composite effect leads to its lower per-user rate 
in 2-hop links. Under the user rate fairness constraint, the 
optimal RSMS zone is determined by the intersection of the 
user data rate served by 1-hop (BSMS) and 2-hop (BS-RS-MS) 
links, marked as “o” in Fig. 5. 
Figure 5.  Capacity Analysis (Per-User Rate) in T-RS with Rate Fairness 
Constraint. 
Fig. 5(b) is very similar to Fig. 5(a) except the different MS 
associations in SISO and MIMO cases in Highest ESE scheme. 
Compared with Highest MCS scheme, its resulted per-user rate 
and system capacity is slightly better, because the MS favors 
the BS more in Highest ESE scheme; however, with a very 
high SE on the relay links, this only affects fairly small number 
of MSs for which both the BS and RSs can support MCS levels 
higher than QPSK-3/4. From our simulation results of SISO-
1RS case, e.g., only 1.4% of MSs falls into this category. 
B. Capacity in 2-Hop Non-Transparent Relay Systems 
In the case of NT-RS, the size of the access zone is almost 
the same for the BS and the RSs except a 2-symbol difference 
(DS). For those MSs served by RSs, their data rate is the 
minimal of the rate it gets on the BS-RS link and on the RS-MS 
link. In order to achieve the maximal system throughput, it is 
not feasible for the RS-MS zone size to be the bottleneck for 
these MSs. This is because the system capacity can be 
improved by simply increasing the size of the access zone in 
this case. For this reason, the optimal access-zone/relay-zone 
partition is always achieved when the MSs served by the RSs 
are limited by relay-zone size and the MSs served by the BSs 
are limited by the access-zone size. For MSi served by RSj, j = 
1, …, M, let Li,j be the resource it actually consumed in RSMS 
zone, and zi,j be its assigned resource in BSRS zone by RSj 
regardless its usage. And let ? ?= jIi jij LL , , ? ?= jIi jij zz , . 
Fig. 6 describes our capacity analysis algorithm for NT-RS 
under rate fairness constraint. Again it can be used to analyze 
the system condition with arbitrary frame partition or MS 
association rule, or to search for the optimal point under user 
rate fairness constraint. Note that x, y, z ? 0 and y + z ? S – DS. 
Figure 6.  Capacity Analysis Algo. in NT-RS with Rate Fairness Constraint. 
Now we want to search for the optimal MS association rule 
that maximizes the system capacity. By bottleneck-BSRS-zone 
assumption, the per-user rate in 1-hop links (AvgR0) and 2-hop 
links by RS j (AvgRj) are

BSRS zone size when the MSs under the BS or the MSs under 
a most heavily loaded RS is system wide bottleneck, 
respectively. Note Z1, Z2 are functions of MS association rules.

It can be seen from Eq.4 that switching a MSi from the BS 
to RSj improves the capacity if and only if ri, 0 < Rj. Therefore 
the optimal rule (NTRS-Rate-Op-I) is as follows: i ? I0 iff either 
ri, 0 ? Rj, or ri, 0 > 0 and ri, j = 0, provided 02

means that only the BS can serve MSi.

under the most heavily loaded RS. The system capacity is:

We designed step-by-step switch-based rule (NTRS-Rate-
Op-II), shown in Fig. 7, to approximate the optimal MS 
association maximizing the system capacity. 
Figure 7.  Optimal Association Rule in NT-RS with Rate Fairness Constraint. 
A perspective of the optimal rule in Fig. 7 is: if 02
0
1 ZZ ?  
holds under NTRS-Rate-Op-I scheme, the optimum is achieved; 
otherwise, selected MSs under RSs are switched to the BS, 
according to NTRS-Rate-Op-II scheme, until Z1 ? Z2. At each 
step, it starts from MSs with the lowest MCS levels served by 
the RSs, and then among them, those with the highest MCS 
levels from the BS are picked as candidates. Finally the MS, 
whose switch will incur the maximum capacity among all 
candidates, is switched to the BS. 
Fig. 8 shows the per-user rate in 1-hop and 2-hop links of 
NT-RS with distributed mode in four cases for Highest MCS, 
Highest Modified ESE and the optimal scheme, respectively. In 
Fig. 8(a), for each case the two-fold line of 2-hop links results 
from the minimization of two straight lines for BS–RS and RS–
MS links. The turning point (Z2) marked as the plus, is the 
change point of bottleneck from BSRS zone to RSMS zone. Its 
slope before or after the turning point (or the turning region) is 
roughly )()( rMrMR ??+ or RrMR )( ?+ , respectively. Here 
R and r are the representative SE of the relay link and access 
link in 2-hop links under rate fairness constraint, respectively, 
and M is the number of RS per sector. The intersection of 1-
hop and 2-hop links (marked by circle) indicates the optimal 
BSRS zone size (Z1) under each MS association rule. 
Figure 8.  Capacity Analysis (Per-User Rate) in Non-Transparent RS in 
Distributed mode with Rate Fairness Constraint. 
Fig. 8(a) and (b) show a typical example of MS association 
rule when Z1 ? Z2 and Z1 > Z2, respectively. While in Fig. 8(c), 
This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 2009 proceedings
the resulted optimal rule locates in the critical situation in the 
between. Note that Highest Modified ESE scheme has 
significantly better capacity than Highest MCS scheme. 
C. Capacity Comparison of Different 2-Hop Relay Systems 
Fig. 9 shows the system capacity comparison with different 
association rules under rate fairness constraint. The system 
capacity with Highest (Modified) ESE scheme in NT-RS is 
based on the different per-user rate in 1-hop and 2-hop links 
due to the fact that no common per-user rate exists in Fig. 8(b). 
In Fig. 9, the capacity improvement brought by the RS, 
especially with MIMO in the relay link, is clearly visible. With 
any MS association rule, the highest capacity gain is achieved 
in NT-RS with 3 RSs per sector in distributed mode and MIMO 
used in the relay link. This is because the radio resources in the 
access link in this configuration has the highest reuse factor, 
therefore the resources saved by MIMO in the relay link and 
then assigned to the access link can be used more fully. For 
example, with Highest MCS scheme, system capacity is 
improved by 133% and 155% over the 1-hop baseline system 
in SISO and MIMO case, respectively. 
Figure 9.  System Capacity Comparison with Rate Fairness Constraint. 
In T-RS, Highest ESE scheme is optimal with slightly better 
system capacity than Highest MCS scheme. While in NT-RS, 
Highest Modified ESE scheme is suboptimal but has the system 
capacity close to the optimal rule; it is also always significantly 
better than Highest MCS scheme. And Highest (Modified) ESE 
scheme requires only information relevant to MS itself and no 
iterations necessary in the computation. Hence it takes much 
less computation time compared with the optimal rule. 
Highest (Modified) ESE scheme can be realized as follows: 
for T-RS, the BS performs the scheduling function with the 
known access and relay links’ qualities; while for NT-RS in 
distributed scheduling mode, to calculate the modified ESE, the 
BS and RSs need to exchange the information: access and relay 
links’ qualities, access station type (BS/RS) and the number of 
RSs per sector.  
IV. SUMMARY 
IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay task standard draft 16jD7 
includes two mutually exclusive options: transparent relay 
systems (T-RS) and non-transparent time-division transmit and 
receive (TTR) relay systems (NT-RS). A system design 
approach is proposed to compare these different options in term 
of capacity with rate fairness constraint. The effect of the 
number of RSs (1 or 3) and different antenna systems (SISO or 
MIMO) in the BS–RS link are considered. The simulation 
results show that NT-RS with 3 RSs per sector in distributed 
mode always achieves the highest system capacity, and that 
both 3 RSs per sector case and MIMO can improve the system 
capacity. Furthermore, two heuristic MS association rules: 
Highest MCS scheme and Highest (Modified) ESE scheme are 
presented and compared with the formulated optimal rule that 
maximizes system capacity under user rate fairness constraint. 
It is shown that Highest (Modified) ESE scheme is optimal in 
T-RS; and that as a suboptimal rule in NT-RS, it has the system 
capacity close to the optimal rule with much less information 
exchange and computation time.
