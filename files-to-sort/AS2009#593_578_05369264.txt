Abstract 
 
Application of data mining in manufacturing  
enterprises’ quality management is introduced. Quality 
factor analysis is very important for quality control and 
production management. In this article, based on 
Rough Set theory an improved Apriori algorithm is put 
forward to mine quantitative relationship among 
different factors which influence product quality. The 
improved algorithm overcomes the traditional Apriori 
algorithm’s limitation of qualitative analysis.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
Data mining is successfully used in many industries, 
such as in steel manufacturing industry, a data mining 
system named ISPA which is developed conjointly by 
American and Japan steel companies is applied to 
analyze product performance and control quality and 
has made great benefits[1]. Generally speaking, in terms 
of applications of data mining in quality control and 
quality analysis, it  can be classified as follows: 
(1) quality control  
For many quality control parameters and process 
parameters, there are no precise mathematical 
expression. it is needed to use observation or other 
methods to determine the corresponding function 
between independent variables and the dependent 
variable. Obviously there are a number of analytical 
expressions, but inconvenient to use, hence a simple 
function approximation to replace the complex 
functions. Regression equation and simulation is 
applied in such cases to analyze the expression of 
independent variables and the relationship between the 
dependent variable.  
(2) quality  analysis 
The formation of quality is affected by a number of 
factors, but a comprehensive analysis of all factors is 
impossible, only the main factors analysis to explore 
the causal relationship between them and the 
association rules is necessary. Analysis of association 
rules in data mining is most commonly used method, 
its main principle is that if two or more of the value of 
parameters appears simultaneously and repeatedly , 
then it is possible that a link between them can be 
established. The most commonly used methods of 
correlation analysis is Apriori algorithm, but the 
traditional Apriori algorithm for mining data is suited 
for the qualitative analysis, and exploring the 
quantitative relationship in production quality 
management is more useful. In this paper, based on 
rough set theory an improved Apriori algorithm is 
proposed[2] . 
(3) quality inspection 
Quality inspection and judgment, such as the 
classification of quality deficiencies, grading of  
product quality, need classification analysis rule. 
Common classification algorithms are Decision Tree 
Algorithm, Rough Sets algorithm and Bayesian 
algorithm. 
In this paper, we propose an improved Apriori 
algorithm basing on rough set attribute reduction 
theory  to extract quality association rules, then an 
example of steel products’ quality rules excavation is 
given to show how this  algorithm is applied. 
 
2. Association knowledge acquisition based 
on rough set 
 
Rough set theory (Rough Set, RS) is a mathematical 
tool to study imprecise and uncertain knowledge, put 
forward by Poland scientist, Professor Z. Pawlak. 
Relationship table of Data Mining can be used as 
information table in rough set. Rough set theory can be 
used to reduce high dimensional data pre-processing to 
remove redundant attributes so as to achieve lower 
dimension[3]. In this paper, the characteristics of rough 
set theory is used to improve the efficiency of rule 
extraction. 
Apriori algorithm is most commonly used in 
extraction of association rules, it is first proposed by R 
Agrawal in 1993 to find links between different items

 in databases to identify customer buying behavior 
models. The core of the Apriori algorithm is based on a 
two-stage frequent set[4] [5] . 
Production process is a complex uncertain process, 
with a characteristics of highly dimensional, strongly 
correlated and non-linear parameters. Production 
quality feature is not only affected by production 
process, but also the   interaction effect among features, 
for example, the mechanical properties of steel are 
related  not only with the rolling parameters, but also 
with the chemical constituents of steel. In view of this 
characteristic, the improved Apriori algorithm bases on 
rough set theory to discretize and reduce high-
dimensional data to improve the efficiency of Apriori 
algorithm; and uses Apriori algorithm’ frequency set 
recursive thinking to search association rules between 
quality attributes.

In this paper, after the establishment of quality-
oriented data warehouse choose the theme to be 
analyzed and related production process data , use 
Apriori algorithm to reduce attribute, and extract the 
relevant decision rules knowledge, the overall 
algorithm is as follows: 
 (1) In accordance with the demand of quality 
analysis, select data tables in the data warehouse to 
determine the condition attribute set C and the results 
attribute set D. Condition attributes consist of product 
properties (such as steel and specifications), quality 
characteristics (such as chemical composition), process 
characteristics (such as heating temperature, silking 
speed and so on). Results attributes consist of target 
attributes, such as physical performance forecasting, 
quality defects and the determination of quality grade. 
Both of them are constituted by several attribute sets, 
based on condition attribute set C and the results 
attribute set D construct attribute set A. 
(2) According to quality analysis's goal, make 
discretization processing to the attribute collection 
value collection V, construct decision table. 
(3) Use reduction algorithm Reduce (E, ES), 
eliminate redundant condition attribute, obtain the 
production data set. 
(4) Apply Apriori association rule extraction 
algorithm to the data set, gain the intrinsic connection 
knowledge among attributes.

3. Application example of data mining in 
quality database 
 
Now take the steel products’ mechanical properties 
as the example, explain the algorithm application in the 
qualitative data warehouse. Assign out production 
information data models such as the steel products 
attribute, the chemical composition, products 
mechanical properties and so on from the quality 
control subject data warehouse, carry on the association 
rule extraction according to the following step. 
 Below am example of stainless steel mechanical 
properties is given to explain the rough set reduction 
process, data is shown in Table 1.

(1) Attribute value discretization: map the attribute 
value to the standard separate mark, each separate mark 
represent a data sector, for instance the cold spindle 
heating temperature may defer to the sector division 
[600,800],[800,1140],[1140,1200] and so on, its 
discrete value mapping is 0,1,2 and so on. After 
attribute value discretizaiton, each record in database is 
expressed by standard discrete value.  
In this example, according to the separate sector 
division, obtains the decision table shown in table 2. 
(2) Define condition attribute set and result attribute 
set. This example aims to analyze factors affecting 
products’ mechanical properties and the association 
rule, to determine steel products’ mechanical properties 
as result attribute. The condition attributes are chemical 
composition content, the tapping temperature and the 
rolling speed, and the chemical composition has several 
principal constituents: Carbon, manganese, phosphorus 
and sulfur.

(3) Condition attribute value reduction. Use the 
rough set reduction algorithm, delete the redundant 
condition attributes, thus raise the following connection 
rule excavation efficiency and the excavation quality 
greatly. Construct distinct matrix and the distinct 
function according to decision table 2, and reduce  
dimension of  decision table to obtain table 3.

(4) Extract quality rule from the decision reduction 
table using Apriori algorithm. Because the Apriori 
algorithm can only process Boolean data , the decision 
table has to be transformed to position chart and then 
apply Apriori to calculate it. The transformed position  
chart is shown in Table 4.

1 0 0 0 1 … 
0 0 1 0 1 … 
1 0 0 0 1 … 
0 1 0 0 0 … 
… … … … … … 
 
(5)  Apply Apriori algorithm to the position chart, 
and select the association rules whose predetermined 
confidence and support conform to expectation valve 
value. Suppose the support is 50%, the confidence is 
80%, the connection rule is { ( 2 ) , ( 0 )} { ( 0 )}a f g? , its 
means that if (carbon content is lower than 0.035%), 
and (rolling speed is smaller than 25m/s) then steel 
products’ mechanical properties (impact merit) will be 
bigger than 24J, the performance will not meet 
standards. This rule’ confidence is bigger than 0.8. 
According to the quality association rules excavated, 
in the production quality control, to avoid unqualified 
mechanical properties, it is required to select those 
steel raw materials whose carbon content is high 
(>0.035%) to escort to the heating furnace, 
simultaneously the rolling speed cannot be too low in 
the steel products rolling, in order to guarantee the end 
product’ quality performance in advance through the 
quality control. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Application of data mining technology in quality 
management mainly in quality control and quality 
analysis is analyzed in this paper. An improved Apriori 
algorithm is proposed based on rough set attribute 
reduction theory  to extract quality association rules, it 
unified the merits of rough set method and association 
rule excavation method, can gain non-redundant 
decision rule the users needed whose confidence valve 
value and support valve value can be predetermined.
