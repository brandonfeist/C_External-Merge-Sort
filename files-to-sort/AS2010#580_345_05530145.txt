ABSTRACT 
This study investigates the moderating role of personality traits on the relationship between customer satisfaction and 
loyalty. Survey data were collected from shoppers of two supermarkets in Beijing, China. The results show that 
consumers’ characteristic of extraversion is positively related to the level of accrued loyalty, while consumer’s 
characteristic of neuroticism attenuates the association between customer satisfaction and loyalty. Implications for 
managers in the retail context are also discussed. 
 
Key words: extraversion, neuroticism, customer satisfaction, loyalty 
 
1. INTRODUCTION1 
 
The antecedent-consequence association between 
customer satisfaction and loyalty has drawn attentions in 
the past three decades. Organizations in service industry 
have invested heavily in efforts to gain customer 
satisfaction that underpins loyalty, which in turn, lead to 
the long term profitability of the firms. There is a general 
belief in industry that customer satisfaction is positively 
related to loyalty, whereas their association rule may 
vary across product category and under differentiated 
market environment [1]. Factors such as personal 
characteristics [2], variety seeking, innovation, and 
relationship proneness [3,4], switching cost or barriers to 
exit [5], prior experience and past behavior [6] have 
demonstrated in literature their roles as the moderator in 
the link of customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
 
Explicit consumer characteristics like demographics 
assume the center of study in previous researches 
exploring the moderating effects of personal 
characteristics. However, the implicit parts of personality 
also matter in evoking consumer needs and demands. 
Many articles in the extant body of literature have 
demonstrated that an individual’s extraversion or 
neuroticism qualities will affect his or her sense of 
satisfaction and choice behavior [7-9]. Thus, these traits 
may also affect his or her judgment on how customer 
satisfaction is associated with loyalty. 
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating 
role of personality in the relationship between customer 
satisfaction and loyalty in the retail context. The 
supermarket sector is characteristized by intensive

competition and voltile market situation. Satisfaction as a 
main driver of excellent customer ralationship allows the 
strategy formulation and execution of satisfaction 
management to become the top priority [10]. What makes 
this study distinct from others is the approach where both 
the relationship between personality and customer 
satisfaction/loyalty and which traits greatly influence this 
association are investigated. The remianing parts of this 
paper are organized as follows. The next section presents 
the literaturer review outcome of customer-loyalty links 
and personality effects just mentioned, also included is 
the conceptual model proposed in this study. The 
research design and the method to verify the 
hypothesises are described in the third section. The 
fourth section contains the results of hierarchical 
regression analsis. Finally, we present the discussion on 
the basis of research findings for managerial implications 
and draw the conclusion. 
 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1 Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty 
 
Scholar indicated that consumers in fact demand channel 
to come up with six service outputs: bulking-braking, 
spatial convenience, shorter waiting time, product 
assortment, customer services, and information provision 
[11]. Among them product quality and service quality 
account for what entice customers to make contribution 
to the operational performance of a channel store [12], 
given the supermarket offers a variety of products and 
complementary services. Past studies have set perceived 
product and service quality as predictors of customer 
satisfaction that has indirect positive effect on loyalty [12]. 
For the service industry where intensive competition is a 
way of life, firms compete on how they can enhance 
customers’ satisfaction so as to retain them, in 
anticipation of securing customer loyalty manifested by 
repeat purchase. Previous researches already indicated

 the significant relevance of customer satisfaction with 
loyalty, assuming loyal customers will buy more, be less 
price sensitive, and are willing to act as enthusiastic 
advocates for their preferable firms [13]. Although 
empirical evidences of this relationship are mixed [1], it is 
well recognized that customer satisfaction is positively 
correlated with loyalty [5]. The higher level of satisfaction 
consumers reach toward a product or service provider, 
the more likelihood customers demonstrate their 
behavioral loyalty [4]. Thus, we assume that: 
 
H1: Product quality has positive influence on customer 
loyalty. 
H2: Service quality has positive influence on customer 
loyalty. 
H3: Customer satisfaction has positive influence on 
customer loyalty. 
 
2.2 Personality Effects 
 
Personality is a psychographic variable which plays 
important role in the domain of psychological behavior 
research. In the fields of marketing and consumer 
behavior, a large proportion of studies are devoted in the 
forecasting of product uses or choices taking into 
account of personality or lifestyle traits [14]. Personality 
refers to certain persistent qualities in human behavior 
[15]. According to the Freudian theory and learning theory, 
the personality traits dominate the individual choice and 
behavior [14-16]. Personality characteristics of an 
individual will affect their subjective well-being [8], job 
satisfaction [17], emotion and customer satisfaction [7, 9].  
 
In this study, we select the extraversion and neuroticism 
out of the Big-Five Factor Model for their 
well-established properties, and analyze their influence 
on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Extraversion is 
distinguished by venturesomeness, affiliation, positive 
affectivity, energy, ascendance and ambition, while 
neuroticism represents distress, nervous tension, 
depression, guilt, low self-esteem, poor control of 
impulses and somatic complaints [7]. An individuals’ 
attitude and behavior are characterized by their 
personality traits. Extraversion characteristics of an 
individual will positively influence their brand affect and 
ecological behavior [16, 18]. Extraversion is positively 
correlated with subjective well-being, whereas 
neuroticism is negatively correlated with subjective 
well-being [8]. Personality trait of neuroticism effects 
negative emotions whereas extraversion effects positive 
emotions [7, 9]. Thus, we can infer that extraversion is 
positively related with positive emotion that engenders 
customer satisfaction, while neuroticism is negatively 
related with the two constructs. Hence, based on the 
associations between customer satisfaction and loyalty, 
we make the hypotheses that: 
 
H4: Extraversion is positively correlated with loyalty. 
H5: Neuroticism is negatively correlated with loyalty. 
 
Investigation in how extraversion and neuroticism as 
moderators of the relationship between customer 
satisfaction and loyalty is a less-visited area. 
Nevertheless, extraverts are more likely to desire a 
relational orientation and positive thinking [19]. The 
relationship orientation, in turn, may be positively related 
to customer satisfaction and loyalty [20, 21]. In addition, 
consumers with greater relationship proneness tend to 
exhibit a stronger relationship between relationship 
quality and behavioral loyalty [3]. Thus, consumers with 
extraversion characteristics are apt to develop affinity 
with certain brand given experiencing satisfaction via 
acts done by the service provider, whereas consumers 
with neuroticism characteristics would experience lower 
levels of attachment when experiencing satisfaction acts 
done by the service provider [22]. Research in job 
satisfaction also revealed that extraversion will moderate 
the relationship between perceived procedural fairness, 
social rewards, and employee job attitudes [23]. Therefore, 
we will investigate the moderating effect of extraversion 
and neuroticism in the context of retail environment, and 
hypothesize that:  
 
H6: The stronger the customer’s extraversion personality, 
the stronger influence on the relationship between 
customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
H7: The stronger the customer’s neuroticism personality, 
the weaker influence on the relationship between 
customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
 
Our proposed conceptual framework is shown as the 
model in Figure 1. The model predicts positive effect of 
extroversion and negative effect of neuroticism on 
loyalty. It is in line with prior research suggesting the 
main effects of customer satisfaction, perceived product 
quality and perceived service quality. The interactions 
between personality traits and customer satisfaction are 
also shown in the model.

 behaviors toward the supermarket store patronized most 
often is used to test the model. The economics growth in 
China advances rapidly enough to attract the entry of 
multinational supermarket retailers such as Carrefour, 
Wal-Mart, and Metro. They compete against domestic 
supermarket retail chains like Wumart and Jingkelong in 
the urban regions. Shoppers of Carrefour and Wumart 
were selected for interview. Data was collected by 
intercept method in the vicinity of these two stores in 
Beijing. A marketing research agency was entrusted to 
conduct the survey. Those who are below 18 years old 
were not allowed to participate in the survey. The 
structure of the questionnaire includes the objective of 
the survey, specific indicators of product quality, service 
quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty, personality 
trait and demographics of the respondents. In November 
2009, 400 consumers in total have been engaged in the 
survey, with 200 respondents for each store respectively. 
We did away with 29 pieces of Carrefour and 28 pieces 
of Wumart response questionnaire due to their 
incompleteness or inconsistency. Thus, the final effective 
sample size was 343 with a response rate of 85.8%. 
 
3.2 Measurement 
 
All constructs were measured by incumbent and tested 
scales extracted from the literature. The scales of product 
quality, service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty 
were adopted from the scales measuring customer 
satisfaction in the retail environment [10, 13, 24]. Six 
statements were taken from Costa and McCrae [25] 
measuring the personality traits of extraversion and 
neuroticism. All question items were evaluated on a 
five-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” 
to “strongly degree”.  
 
3.3 Demographics 
 
The demographics for each sample are presented in Table 
1. On the total sample statistics, female consumers 
answered most of the survey instruments, accounting for 
68.5% of the respondents. The sample was 
approximately equally distributed across age, and a large 
portion of the samples were middle class citizens with 
the income of less than 4,000 RMB/month and without 
college graduates. About 50% of correspondents in the 
sample frame bought at these supermarkets 4 to 6 times a 
month. The sample was nearly consistent across the two 
supermarkets. However, on the average, shoppers of 
Wumart stores are senior to and less educated than those 
of Carrefour stores. 
 
3.4 Factor Analysis 
 
Factor analysis was conducted on the two samples 
combined. Consistent with the underlying theory, the 
number of factors to be retained was specified to six 
factors and a varimax method was performed since they 
are believed to be correlated. Based on the exploratory 
factor analysis, two items from product quality, two 
items from service quality, one item from customer 
satisfaction, and one item from loyalty were dropped due 
to poor factor loadings or cross loadings. The six factors 
explained 63.1% of the variance and were exhibited in 
Table 2, where LO=loyalty, CS=customer satisfaction, 
SQ=service quality, PQ=product quality, 
EX=extraversion, and NE=neuroticism. Value of 
Cronbach’s alpha for each construct was also calculated 
in Table 2. The value of coefficient for extraversion, 
product quality, and neuroticism did not exceed the 
general accepted criterion of 0.7. Taking into account 
that the value of coefficient is affected by the sample size 
and number of items, we used the means of each 
construct in the following analysis to test the proposed 
model.

3.5. Descriptive Statistics 
 
The mean scores of the constructs were calculated as 
shown in Table 3. The mean scores on a 5-point scale are 
about 4 for loyalty, customer satisfaction, product quality, 
and service quality, suggesting moderately positive 
evaluation of the supermarket patronized most often. The 
average ratings of personality traits are 4.03 for 
extraversion and 2.55 for neuroticism, implying the 
respondents feature distinctive outgoing personality. 
 
Table 3 also shows the correlations among the constructs. 
As having been hypothesized, customer satisfaction, 
product quality, service quality, and extraversion are 
positively correlated with loyalty. The negative 
relationship between neuroticism and loyalty, however, is 
not that significant. Customer satisfaction, product 
quality, and service quality are positively correlated, 
while extraversion and neuroticism are negatively 
correlated, as previous literature so suggested.

4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS 
 
Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the 
hypothesis. In order to reduce multicollinearity between 
the main effect variables and their interaction terms, all 
main effect variables were mean centered prior to the 
creation of interaction terms [26].The data for the two 
supermarkets were analyzed combined together. A 
variable (STORE) was created to reflect the two 
supermarkets with Wumart stores as reference group in 
this study. Three regression models were established. The 
first one included the direct effects of customer 
satisfaction, service quality and product quality. The 
difference of loyalty between Carrefour and Wumart was 
also illustrated in this model. The second model added 
the main effects of extraversion and neuroticism to 
analyze the role of these two variables in the formation 
of consumer loyalty. Finally, the model explored the 
interaction effects of personality traits and customer 
satisfaction. The three models were evaluated as table 4.  
 
Model 1 has shown, consistent with previous studies, 
that customer satisfaction and service quality has 
significant positive impact on loyalty. H1 and H3 are 
supported. The positive effect of product quality, 
however, is not proved in this study. A reasonable and 
plausible explaination is that products there are mainly 
low involvement goods for daily use, consumers rather 
pay more attention to the service in the retail 
environment, especially for the formation of purchase 
behavior or repurchase behavior. What is also salient lies 
in the inference that customer satisfaction may play a 
mediating role in the relationship between product 
quality and loyalty, since the correlation between the two 
variables is significantly positive as shown in Table 3. 
Hence, the direct effect of product quality on loyalty is 
not significant in this study, H3 is not supported. 
 
Consumers dispaly a higher level of loyalty for Wumart 
stores than that for Carefour stores as the variable of 
STORE has significant negative impact on the dependent 
variable. A possible reason is that the age distribution of 
consumers are different between the two supermarkets. 
As previously stated, Wumart are largely sponsored by 
senior consumers group who have limited 
information-processing capabilities and tend to stick to a 
store brand than the yonger group does [4] . 
 
We added the main effects of extraversion and 
neuroticism in Model 2, and the R-squared value 
increased significantly. The coefficients of the two 
variables demonstrated that the main effect of 
extraversion is in place as it has significant positive 
impact on loyalty, Hypothesis 4 is supported. As opposed 
to hypothesis 5, neuroticism does not significantly affect 
customer loyalty.

The moderating effect of these two personality traits 
were further analyzed in Model 3. Consistent with 
Hypothesis 7, the moderating effect of neuroticism is 
proved, while Hypothesis 6 about moderating effect of 
extraversion is not supported. Figure 2 and Figure 3 
show the effect of interactions graphically. Consumers of 
high extraversion inclination are readily loyal to the store 
brand than consumers with low extraversion aptitude. 
The relationship between customer satisfaction and 
loyalty are weaker for consumers with high neuroticism 
inclination, and vice versa. The personality trait of 
neuroticism displays a significant moderating effect on 
the customer satisfaction-loyalty link. The interaction 
 effect of extraversion, and the main effect of neuroticism 
on loyalty, however, are not significant in this study.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Previous research has largely neglected the issue of 
moderating effects of implicit factors, e.g. personality 
traits, on the relationship between customer satisfaction 
and loyalty. Against this background, the moderating 
impacts of extraversion and neuroticism traits on the 
satisfaction-loyalty link are investigated in this study. 
The results reveal that extraversion aptitude has 
significant positive effect on customer loyalty, whereas 
neuroticism inclination is detrimental to the association 
between customer satisfaction and loyalty. The results 
also shed light on the importance of customer 
satisfaction and service quality as the literature has 
already suggested. Re-formulating and executing a 
refined strategy that improve service quality and enhance 
customer satisfaction will be the top priority for 
management in the retail context. 
 
The outcome of this research work makes a significant 
contribution to fill the gap in the literature of customer 
satisfaction and loyalty. It does so by providing a deep 
insight at the role of personality traits in the formation of 
loyalty. The classical CRM strategy to improve loyalty 
through increasing satisfaction is not always applicable 
to every customer un-distinguishably; rather it depends 
on the personality characteristics of consumer. Service 
marketing practitioners can also benefit from this 
research in discovering the origin and evolution of 
customer loyalty to formulate and execute appropriate 
marketing strategies. This study not only confirms the 
past findings in the extant body of literature that service 
quality and customer satisfaction play a crucial role in 
loyalty, but also discloses the implication of their 
dependence on consumers’ personality characteristic. It 
is important for companies to discriminate customer 
groups who rely on satisfaction as the mediating driver to 
underpin loyalty from groups who are less sensitive to 
the satisfaction-loyalty conjugation [5]. This research 
outcome indicates that an across-the-board CRM 
strategies to increase customer satisfaction not 
necessarily yields higher level of loyalty that is generally 
believed to be the antecedent of company profitability. 
Consumers with neuroticism trait subject to the tendency 
of store switching, building a long term intimate relations 
with them could be a target too far to reach. 
 
This research comes with some limitations and 
subsequent opportunities for further study. First, the main 
effect of neuroticism and the moderating effect of 
extraversion didn’t manifest themselves in this study. 
The purchase decision in a grocery supermarket context 
involves complicated factors besides product and service 
quality. Other considerations such as pricing, promotion, 
discounting, food safety, country of origin, the use of 
private brand, and etc. inevitably interfere with the 
decision making process of customers in terms of repeat 
purchase. Applying the model to other contexts like 
specific product category or pure service industry can be 
the alternative to see the role of personality traits in the 
customer satisfaction-loyalty link. Second, we have 
focused on the relationship between customer 
satisfaction and loyalty. It would be desirable to analyze 
the role of personality traits in the formation process of 
customer satisfaction, and loyalty-profitability 
associations, in that way, we can from a broader 
perspective to gain a deeper insight into the impact of 
personality characteristics on consumption behavior 
Finally, reliability and validity of some constructs are not 
so satisfactory owing to the exploratory nature of this 
study. Further investigations are needed in the future to 
explore the functions of personality in consumer choice 
and behavior.
