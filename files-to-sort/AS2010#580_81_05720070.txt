Abstract - Population using Mobile phones and Mobile 
applications is increasing every day. Emergence of Cloud 
Computing and advances in Wireless Communication 
technologies has changed the dynamics of mobile applications 
by providing Scalable On-Demand High Available 
Infrastructure at minimal cost with zero maintenance and 
empowered with faster data transfer. Enterprises have started 
to develop Cloud based mobile applications that can target 
their Customers who are on the move. This paper presents a 
Cloud based Context Aware mobile application that targets 
Travel, Healthcare, Education and Retail Enterprises and 
their Users. Machine Learning techniques such as Association 
rules were used to analyze the mobile end user data on the 
Cloud towards predicting the services preferred by the End 
User. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Marriage of Cloud computing and Emerging Wireless 
Technologies could ensure Pervasive Access and help 
towards Seamless Scalability, Zero Maintenance, Fault 
Tolerance, Minimal Infrastructure and On-Demand delivery 
of various Vital services such as Healthcare, Education and 
Shopping/Business experiences [1].  This has a tremendous 
impact on Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICT) which could eventually bridge the ‘Digital Divide’ 
and specifically enables an innovative way to deliver 
ubiquitous services. We had developed a service platform 
entitled “Pervasive Cloud” on which various applications 
can be developed [2].  These applications could require high 
computing power, or could be database applications where 
huge amount of data has to be stored and accessed. 
Pervasive Cloud is based on convergence of emerging 
technologies such as Cloud and Mobile computing and 
could be used to provide inexpensive solutions with minimal 
infrastructure.   
Our Application ‘Musafir’ which has been deployed on 
the “Pervasive Cloud” empowers the People-On-The-Move 
and provides context aware Travelling support, which at 
present is being extended to Education, Healthcare and 
Shopping applications. ‘Musafir’ is a Rich Internet Mobile 
application which runs on a Mobile Internet Device (MID) 
or in general, any Mobile device and would be able to 
connect to a Public Cloud at Real Time.  ‘Musafir’ enables 
an End User (a) A Context Aware Business Application 
that could assist Consumers for their Travel Needs. (b)To 
register Health Complaints and receive proper Diagnosis 
and Medicine (c) Access to Educational Videos (d) Demos 
of various Retail products to understand and estimate the 
quality of the products and the location they are available.  
 
II. MUSAFIR 
 
A. Context Aware Travel Assistant 
  Owing to the personalized nature of services, context 
aware applications could be developed to target personal 
travel [3]. Context aware applications are usually built by a 
set of manually defined rules which can define user 
behavior for varying context or user defined preferences. 
This could lead to inaccuracies and hence improper 
services. Machine learning empowered context aware 
application can improve the accuracy of such service 
discoveries. Bayesian network could be used to develop an 
intelligent engine, as this could address context aware 
problems by analyzing historical activity (behavioral log) 
of individual persons [4].  Reasoning could also be used to 
the study context in an ubiquitous environment [5]. The 
prominence of context aware application is steadily 
growing with the advent of mobile devices and other 
wearable wireless sensors. Indeed there was a lot of 
research literature available towards context awareness in 
an ubiquitous environment [6-8]. However when we talk 
about context awareness it mostly focuses on personalized 
services and it is well known that the number of end-users 
is also a constantly increasing factor. Scalability could well 
be an issue if the data collected for such an application is 
too large. ‘Cloud Computing’ could be of help in such a 
scenarios.  
Musafir employs Association Rules [9] towards Context 
Awareness, and could be used by End User/ Consumers or 
by Travel Service Providers to facilitate travel of their 
customers. Association rules find association or 
relationships among large sets of data. These rules are

Probabilistic in nature and provide results of Data Mining 
in the form of ‘if-then statements’. Appropriate rules are 
selected from the set of all possible Rules, Constraints on 
various measures of Significance and Interest. Association 
rules have often been used to perform Market Basket 
Analysis successfully. In this study we had used Apriori 
Algorithm of the Association rules to determine Traveler’s 
preference.  
 
We had used a part of the Public Mobile User Data set 
that was provided by the MIT media Lab [10], which 
consisted of User Profiles, Cell Tower ID and their Daily 
Routines etc. These details were stored in a Database which 
we hosted on a Public Cloud. In order to understand the 
usage of the said Datasets for a Travel based application, 
we had prepared a detailed travel record for each of the 
mobile user. The dataset we developed for user travel was 
divided into different categories viz. Very Frequent /Often/ 
Rare Travelers according to user Profile. Travel records 
consisted of their preferred mode of travel viz flight, train, 
bus or own car, journey date, their mobile and IMEI 
number. System context View of Musafir is shown in 
figure 1.

Client End Form for the Mobile End User was developed 
using JAVA / J2ME for Services, which have Push Buttons 
for Services, an End User may require (figure 2a). 
 
 
Fig. 2a. End User Form for Musafir’s Travel Module 
 
The End User clicks on the ‘Travel’ button and fills in 
the details (see figure 2b). 
 
Fig. 2b. Travel Service Form 
 
End User’s IMEI Number, Mobile Number, Time of 
Request and Place of request and other filled details would 
be sent to the JAVA Servlet running on the Cloud. Study 
was only concentrated on mobile phones whose IMEI 
number could be extracted [11]. Snapshot view of travel 
database used in the study is shown in figure 2c. The 
Servlet first executes SQL queries to extract History details 
about the Mobile user based on IMEI and Mobile Number. 
A temporary table, which consists of travelling patterns of a 
particular person, is formed and Aprori algorithm is applied 
on the resultant temporary table. The algorithm will extract 
rules based on the history details and would provide 
probabilities for mode of travel of a particular person as 92
illustrated in figure 2d. Mode of travel that has the highest 
probability would be chosen and send to the person who 
initiates the travel request. Mobile screen shot of the 
response to the travel request is shown in figure 2e.

database for a particular person 93

User request 
 
  End User would then be able to view his choice on their 
mobile screen. Once the End User confirms the Mode of 
Travel, a list of schedules of Preferred Mode of Travel 
from Source to Destination with all the details is retrieved 
and shown on the Mobile Screen of the End User (figure 
2f). End User can then book for the Travel.

Discounts 
 
One of the main objectives of context aware applications 
is to discover service according to the user’s preference. 
Web has transformed so much that many enterprises 
provide certain services like Map, RSS, product search etc 
as API (Application Programming Interface) which can be 
invoked by general users. These API’s could be very useful 
for a traveler. For example a Map service can help to locate 
a place or provide driving directions from a place to 
another. In Musafir we had used the Map Service API [12] 
to help the end user by  providing the Driving Direction 
(from source to destination) if they opt for driving their 
own Transport / Car (figure 2g). Musafir provides a 
separate servlet to address this. This servlet has two 
functions viz. (a) map service API (b) API function 
provided by a 3rd party bulk Short Message Service (SMS) 
service provider. Once the end user indicates to the servlet 
that they prefer driving their own transport, Map Service 
API is invoked to get the driving directions for the travel 
and the link to page is sent as an SMS using the SMS API 
function to the users mobile phone. 
 
 
 
Fig. 2g. Map showing the Driving Direction between the Source 
and Destination 
 
The two Servlets mentioned above are actually connected 
to a MySQL database table called ‘journeydet’ present in 
the Cloud. Once the user confirms the bookings travel 
details of the users along with their mobile number, IMEI 
number, date of journey, source and destination of journey, 
mode of journey etc are stored in a table ‘journeydet’. This 
will help in eliminating static rules and the dataset for 
Apriori algorithm will have an improved support such that 
it can provide more accurate results based on the Dynamic 
Database details.  
 A small automated program (procedure), would run at 
the start of everyday.  It has three main functions (a) search 
function, which is basically a SQL query to select details 
(Mobile number, source and destination of travel) of those 
who are travelling on that particular day from journeydet 
table (b) Invoke weather service API [13] and find out the 
respective weather conditions for each of the identified 94
destination (c) SMS API which would then send the 
respective weather information to the corresponding mobile 
numbers. This information would help to facilitate the 
travel arrangements of the end user. 
 
B. Healthcare, Education and Shopping Modules 
 End User forms (figure 3a) were developed based on 
Flex Technology which would facilitate Rich User 
Experience. User can fill in the Health Complaints and 
submit the details to the Cloud. A third party API which 
facilitates SMS to a Mobile device was integrated with the 
Servlet program.  Once the Database (on the Cloud) is 
updated with the Health complaints, the API can trigger an 
alert to a registered expert Physician. 
 
 
Fig. 3a. End User entering the health complaints 
 
Physicians were provided with a mobile application, 
which would help them to assess the Patient’s Health 
Complaints from the Cloud database [2]. Physician, up on 
analyzing the case,  can submit their Diagnosis and 
Prescription details to the Cloud Database seamlessly, 
which would send an SMS alert to the patient who filled in 
the Complaint. This application also empowers the End 
User to transfer ECG and images to the Cloud which could 
also be viewed by the Physician (figure 3b).

from the Cloud 
Education Module of Musafir empowers an End User to 
select and watch Videos relating subjects of their interest.  
The typical End User could be any consumer and 
specifically academic community around the world.  The 
videos will be streamed from the Cloud (figure 4). 
Performance of such an application depends on bandwidth 
of the network and type of communication technology 
used. In our lab environment we were able to upload a 
5MB file to the Cloud in roughly around 2minute 30 
seconds to 3 minutes and the time taken to download the 
file / stream the file from the same is around 1 minute 30 
seconds to 2 minutes considering the connection speed to 
be a maximum of 512KBPS DSL Connection.

Screen interface 
 
Shopping module of Musafir enables an End User / 
Consumer, to watch Demos related to various Retail 
Products, to understand the Location of their availability, 
their Price and to store their personalized shopping choices 
in a ‘Shopping Cart’, which could connect to a 
Billing/Credit Card System (figure 5).

Security is a major concern for web based applications, 
where there is a possibility of a large number of users. 
Having realized the sensitivity of datasets we are trying to 
address security issue by using 128 byte Advanced 
Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm on the datasets [14]. 95
For each application there would a set of administrators and 
end users. Hence a role based access to the database is also 
being studied and implemented. We are currently working 
towards making Healthcare, Education and Shopping 
modules more ‘intelligent’ by making them Context-
Aware.  
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Musafir was targeted towards Healthcare, Retail, Travel, 
Education /Content Management Business Groups and its 
Users. The application provides (a) Pervasive learning 
access through videos and On-Demand Education (b) 
Empowers Online Shopping and Business On-the-Move (c) 
Real Time and Pervasive Primary Health Care Service (d) 
Context aware Travel Solution.
