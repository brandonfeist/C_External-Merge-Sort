Abstract-Networks are well-suited model for representing 
complex systems and processes. This paper proposed a novel 
perspective on study of the evolvement of export market 
structure by combining network-based approach with data 
mining technology. Firstly, bipartite networks were constructed 
to describe the relationships that form between enterprises and 
their export markets based on China's Guangdong custom 
statistical data for the 2000-2005 periods. Network analysis 
techniques were used to analyze and describe the topology 
properties of the whole networks as well as their evolution over 
time. Secondly, data mining techniques were used to identify 
most frequent association relations and evolvement rule hidden 
in bipartite networks.

I. INTRODUTION 
Exporting is the simplest mode of internationalizing a 
domestic business and the most common form of international 
business activity, comparing with other modes of entry, for 
instance licensing, franchising, management contract and 
foreign direct investment (FDI) [1]. A fInn or enterprise does 
not have to be the size of these multinational giants to facilitate, 
and benefIt from, the globalization of markets, either via 
exports or international production [2]. 
Expansion into new markets, for business enterprises or 
fIrm, has two benefIts: First, a fIrm may be able to achieve 
economies of scale, lowering its average costs as its production 
increases. Second, such expansion diversities a fInn's revenue 
steam. As it serves more countries, the fInn becomes less 
dependent on its sales in any one country; thereby protecting 
itself should that country's economy tum sour. So seeking new 
foreign markets is a common motive for international 
expansion of enterprise, and also is the main export-oriented

economics strategy for both developed countries and 
developing countries. 
Complex network theory, originated in research on 
complex systems in physics and computer science, has proved 
to be effective in understanding many different phenomena, 
drawn from technological, biological and social world. In the 
language of networks, bipartite network can be extracted from 
the international trade activity, where enterprises representing 
one of type node (actors or economic agents), foreign markets 
(countries) representing other type node. The edges represent 
trade tie between business enterprise and export market. In this 
way, the export trade system can be examined under a 
topological point of view. The analysis results will reveal 
complex properties that cannot be explained by conventional 
established trade statistical methods. 
Although there is nowadays a signifIcant amount of 
powerful tools to analyses one-mode networks, special network 
techniques for large bipartite network or two-mode network are 
very complicated and limited. So the solution commonly used 
is to change or project the two-mode network into a one-mode 
network, which can be analyzed with standard techniques. For 
example, the actor-movies network is transformed into actor 
collaboration network where two actors are linked of they acted 
together in a movies [3]; the company board networks are 
transformed into company interlock network where two 
persons are linked together if they are member of a same board 
[4]. 
However more and more researchers realize that the 
projection may lead to lose much important information and 
cause other problems [5]. For example, some properties of the 
network may be due to the projection process rather than the 
underlying data itself (e.g. one observes high clustering 
coefficients). Therefore considering the bipartite statistics 
brings significant information as compared to the projections. 
But another problem is that, considering the complexity in 
the real world network, only studying mathematically topology 
statistics using existing network analysis tools cannot discover 
hidden rules or intrinsically structured patterns in complex 
network. New methodology or method needs to be developed. 
Data mining as a novel technique of discovering the hidden 
pattern and link in complex social network or graph is 
interesting research or application field. [6] [7] [8] 
This study attempts to combine complex network modeling 
and analysis approach with data mining technique, for the 
purpose of providing a new insight to understand the system's 
dynamics, observable on the aggregate level, and how they can 
be trance back to the structural properties, and link pattern or 
rules hidden in network. 
II.  NETWORK MODELING & ANALYSIS 
A. Research Background 
Guangdong is the largest foreign trade province in China. 
In 2007, the export of Guangdong reached US$369.25 billion, 
accounting for 30.3% of the national total, had consecutively 
kept frrst rank in the past two decades. Guangdong's economic 
achievement is largely attributed to the adoption of export 
-oriented industrialization as the region's main development 
strategy. According to Guangdong custom statistical data, only 
354 private enterprises export their products to 138 countries in 
2000, but in 2007, the number of export private enterprises 
more than 17324, export countries covered global region. The 
reason for rapid growth is that the government departments 
have adopted a serial measures to boosting the development of 
import-export private enterprises: 
• Lower the qualifications for private production 
enterprises to engage in import-export business, all 
private enterprises capable of producing export 
products may apply for import-export rights in 1999. 
• Simplify approval procedures. Foreign trade, industry 
and commerce, customs, foreign exchange 
administration and state taxation departments, as well 
714 
as banks and inspection and quarantine authorities 
undertake to complete formalities for the approval of 
import-export rights for qualified private production 
enterprises within one working day. 
• Ease restrictions on registered capital by allowing 
newly-established private enterprises to pay up their 
registered capital by installment. 
• Encourage private enterprises to open up international 
markets. For five years starting from 2003, the 
provincial government will allocate Rmb25 million 
each year to an export-oriented private enterprises 
development fund to assist these enterprises in 
expanding the international market. 
• Expedite tax rebate for private enterprises. 
• Simplify credit approval and relax loan terms. 
Changes in trade policy result in a significant growth in the 
number of private enterprise which started internationalizing 
through export. Total export of private enterprises has become 
the new growth targets for Guangdong's exports. However due 
to impact of global financial crisis, export orders of private 
enterprises (especially among its major export markets-the 
United States, the EU, and Japan) started to drop since the first 
quarter in 2008 and the annual growth rate of export has 
dropped to 8% from 29.9% in 2007. 
Obviously international trade goes beyond the fundamental 
exchange of goods and services; it can also be the channel for 
crises spreading [9]. The complexity of dynamic interaction 
among a large number of different agents, the resulting system 
behavior had been proven difficult to predict and control. So 
we need a new and a more fundamental insight into the 
system's dynamics and how they can be traced back to the 
structural properties. Therefore, network-based approaches 
may provide a more powerful way to manage, monitor, and 
govern complex economics systems [10]. 
B. Bipartite Network Modeling 
Bipartite network as a model tool was widely recognized 
because many networks in real world display a natural bipartite 
structure [11]. From this point of view, we assume EMN = 
(Enterprise, Market, Arcs) is the bipartite enterprise-market 
network, which is direct and weighted network. Let m and n be 
the number of markets and enterprises respectively. The 
volume of the trade flow from i-th "enterprise" node to j-th 
"market" node is the link weight. We constructed 6 bipartite 
networks, each network corresponding to a trade year (from 
2000 to 2005).

C. Node Degree and Degree Distribution 
A first way to describable network statistics is to count the 
number of links maintained by each node: this measure is 
referred to as node in-degree and out-degree. In our study, 
out-degree, for each enterprise, measures the number of its 
foreign markets, which representing result of 
internationalization process. In-degree, for each market, 
measures the number of private enterprises (exporting their 
products to the market). Table I reports summary statistics for 
EMN and nodes. 
Although the number of nodes, in particular the number of 
enterprise, has significantly increased over time, network 
density reduced from 0.074 to 0.058. This means that trade 
relationships have grown slower than size of network, i.e. 
seeking new markets is not an easy job for most private 
enterprises. The growing slowly average degree (from 10.19 to 
12.86) and median values (4-----6) of enterprise node over time 
confmns the result for network density. About 20% of the 
nodes have degree one. This also states that one-fifth of the 
enterprises only have a single foreign market, which is first 
715 
1909 3586 6121 8023 
1(5%) 1(2%) 1(2%) 1(2%) 
step of internationalization, i.e. foreign market entry is a 
gradual process. 
Figure I. (a) Distribution of out-degree; 
(b) Cumulative distribution of in-degree 
Figure l.a shows that out degree distributions are very 
heterogeneous and well fitted by power laws because the plot is 
a straight line of negative slope in log-log scales. The 
exponents, as a measure of the heterogeneity of the 
distribution, are about 2-----3 (2.08, 2.42, 2.53, 2.66, 2.89 and 
2.77 respectively in 2000-2005). These imply there are 
significant differences in strategy and ability of exploiting 
international market for different enterprises. For example, the 
maximum value of out-degree increased from 62 to 135 during 
5 years. 
For "market" node, the average value of in-degree 
significantly increased from 26.07 to 649.02. This states that a 
serial of export -oriented industrialization policy arouse the 
enthusiasm of exploiting foreign market for private enterprises. 
The average value and the maximum value of in-degree remain 
higher than the median in all years. This implies that most 
markets are far from been exploited (e.g. countries in Africa), 
but some typically have numerous entrants. 
Figure l.b shows the cumulative distribution of in-degree. 
Although the shape of the distribution is not well fitted by a 
power law, shows heavy tailed. The exponents decreased from 
1.8 to 1.4 in the 2000-2005 periods, where lower exponents 
reveal higher heterogeneity. Observed value of in-degree spans 
several orders of magnitudes (from 1 to more than 8,000). 
Moreover, there are always two special data points in tail 
(Hong Kong and America respectively) far away from other 
data points. In such cases, the average value brings little 
information: it not the value observed on most objects, and a 
randomly chosen object may exhibit a very different value. 
Therefore, characterizing the heterogeneity of the distribution 
is more meaningful. 
D. Node Strength and Strength Distribution 
The strength of a node, integrating the information both 
with its connectivity and the importance of the weights of its 
links, is a very significant measure of the network properties. 
In our study, export size per enterprise represents the 
out-strength of "enterprise" node, which is the sum of link 
weight of flow out. Export share per market can be defmed as 
the in-strength of "market" node, which is the sum of link 
weight of flow in. 
The strength distributions are given in Figure 2. The shape 
of log-log distributions are more suitable exponent rather than a 
power law in two cases. For enterprise nodes, the size of export 
has a power-law distribution for large size enterprises whose 
strength greater than 107 dollars. The phenomenon, Pareto-Zipf 
law (exponent equal 1) holds for firm size x larger than 
observational threshold xO, also can be observed on many 
empirical studies of firm dynamic, where firm size can be 
profit, sale amount, states of company, the numbers of 
employee.

Figure 2. (a) Distribution of out-strength 
(b) Cumulative distribution of in-strength 
The mean value of in-strength has significantly increased 
between 2000 and 2005. But the difference between mean 
value and median value becomes bigger and bigger. This 
means the distribution of market share is highly skewed to the 
right. The growing maximum values over time confirm 
asymmetry in export share. For example, in 2005 dataset, Hong 
Kong is the largest export market for Guangdong's private 
enterprise, 8023 (71.6%) enterprises export products to Hong 
Kong, account for 29.1 % of total export. The second is 
America market. Nearly 55% enterprise export to America, 
contributing 18.5% of total export. The shapes of the 
cumulative distribution of in-strength are very similar in all of 
year. These imply the similarity of foreign market structure: 
although enterprise's export market have expanded to globe 
region, but centralized a few trade partners or countries. 
III. RULE MINING & LINK ANALYSIS 
A. Market Association Rule Mining 
Association Rules Mining (ARM) has been introduced in 
the context of Market Business Analysis. Input data are 
composed of transactions: each transaction consists of items 
purchased by a consumer during a single visit. Output data are 
composed of rules. For example, a rule can be "90% of 
transactions that involve the purchase of bread and butter also 
include milk". [12] 
An association rule is of the form X7Y (support, 
confidence), where the support is the percentage of records in 
datasets containing X and Y (or simply the joint probability 
p(Xny)), the confidence is the percentage of records in 
datasets containing X that also contain Y (or can be written 
as the conditional probability P(YIX)). Support is used to 
evaluate the statistical importance of the rule. The measure 
confidence is used to evaluate the level of confidence about the 
association rules X7Y. In order to reduce the possible biases 
incurred when using measure standards, the simplest way is to 
use the lift judgment. Lift is defined as: Lift = 
Confidence(X 7 Y)/Support(Y). If lift value is equal to 1, then 
X and Y are independent and there is no correlation between 
them. If lift value is less than 1, then the occurrence of X is 
negatively correlated with the occurrence of B. If lift value is 
greater than 1, then X and Y has positively correlated, meaning 
that the occurrence of one implies occurrence of the other. 
From the point of view of data mining, a network is a 
heterogeneous and multi-relational data set represented by a 
mathematical matrix or graph. In our case, we consider 
two-mode data as transaction data: each transaction consists of 
all foreign markets of an enterprise during one year. In this 
way, ARM can be used to search for frequent co-occurrence 
market association pattern, and also discover interesting 
bi-clique in bipartite graph. [13] 
This study uses the Apriori algorithm, the minimum 
support and minimum confidence of the association rules are 
set to 25% and 50% respectively, and the lift of a rule is greater 
than 1. Table II and Table III reports mining result for 2000 
and 2005 two time point.

most frequent market association, e.g. the rule support 
increased from 41.5% to 44.8%. This means that more 40 
percent enterprises choose USA and Hong Kong as common 
export markets. If from the view of bipartite network, (USA, 
Hong Kong) is the common neighbors of maximal bi-clique.

Other markets associating strongly with Hong Kong 
include: Japan, U.K., Germany, Australia, Canada, Singapore, 
and Italy ecL This can further explain the tight economic and 
trade relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The 
reasons are: from mid-1980s, Guangdong is a major 
export-processing base for foreign investors, because of Hong 
Kong's dominant share of total FDI, Hong Kong gradually 
become the hub of the South China Economic Zone and 
"middle man" as re-exports to the developed countries. 
B. Web-link Analysis 
Web-link analysis technique or web graph in data mining 
provides a visualization analysis tool to fmd manually 
association relations. Web graph shows relationships between 
markets. By filtering out the weakest strength of the 
relationship, the stronger compartments emerge from the 
network. 
In fact, web-link analysis is similar to m-slice analysis in 
social network. For one-mode networks (often rather dense) 
derived from two-mode affiliation networks, one of methods 
defming cohesive subgroups is based on line multiple rather 
than the number of neighbors because they are less personal 
and more institutional [14]. From this point of view, the larger 
the number of common entrant (i.e. export enterprise) between 
two markets, the stronger or more cohesive their tie, the more 
similar or interdependent they are. 
Figure 3. Market-Web in 2000(link strength >=70) 
We draw market-web graph according to the strength of 
relationships between market and market. Nodes of web graph 
represent markets. The larger the node, the larger the market 
share. The weight of edge linking two nodes represents the 
number of common export-enterprises. For instance, in Figure 
4, the strength or common links is 5016 between "Hong Kong" 
and "USA". In other words, the association relationship 
between "Hong Kong" and "USA" is strongest. 
718 
The growth of market association relation network from 
2000 to 2005 indicated market web expanding over time, 
leading to the emergence of "hub" market group or critical 
nodes set. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, the most densely linked 
group of market around Hong Kong and USA. This densely 
linked group consists mainly of countries in North America, 
Western Europe, Japan and Australia. Several Asia countries, 
Korea, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and U.A.E., became most 
potential foreign market, which reflects the regional component 
of private enterprise export trade development because of 
geographical advantage. 
Figure 4. Market-Web in 2005 (link strength >=2200) 
Although some emerging markets, the export markets 
converge a few trade partners or countries. The cumulative 
system effect will result in unstable in export trade, which is 
vulnerable to international economic fluctuation, in particular, 
arising from "Hubs" markets (having a large degree). The 
reason is, from systems perspective, the structure of system 
always affects functions (not only positive effect but also 
negative effect). This fact is likely to explain that export share 
in traditional market experienced a significantly decline 
between 2008 and 2009 due to impact of America fmancial 
crisis. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we firstly analyzed varying topology 
properties on the structure of export market based on bipartite 
network modeling at different time snapshot. Secondly, we 
used data mining approach to mine most frequent market 
association patterns hidden in large bipartite network data. The 
empirical results provided a new insight to understand the 
system behavior on the aggregate level and how they can be 
trance back to the structural properties, hidden links and 
underlying rules. 
Guangdong stumbled onto an export and foreign 
investment strategy that has proved remarkably successful, 
helping the economy move quickly to a market-based system. 
One of key elements in Guangdong's success in the world 
markets has been the so-called 'Hong Kong connection'. In the 
mid-1980s, Hong Kong entrepreneurs began shifting 
manufacturing facilities to China mainland, attracted by lower 
labor costs as wages rose rapidly at home. This link with Hong 
Kong has not only brought much needed capital to Guangdong 
but also supplied new technology, modem management 
practices and critical links to the world market. Today more 
than half of Guangdong's exports to the rest of the world are 
handled by Hong Kong. 
But the global crisis of industrialization offers important 
lessons for Guangdong's economic development as well. The 
Guangdong suffered from a sharp decline in export demand, 
large-scale closures of Small and Medium Enterprises and 
massive lay-offs of migrant worker. Labor-intensive, 
export-oriented sectors have gradually lost much of their 
competitive edge, as rising costs of labor, land and raw 
materials and stagnant selling prices have eroded their profit 
margin in recent years. Even without the financial crisis, the 
industrial sector in Guangdong needs to be restructured and 
upgraded, just like what the Asian Tigers have been 
experiencing during the last twenty years. 
However in the long run, structural problems such as 
over-dependence on export markets, shortfalls in education and 
R&D development and absence of proper protection of 
property rights will emerge as major constraints for successful 
restructuring. There are still some big challenges ahead to 
adjust the structure of export goods. 
Considering economics network as a complex adaptive 
system, motivation of agent will be very helpful to study the 
formation of market network and mechanism of evolution. In 
the future we will focus on the research in that aspect. The 
research fmdings will provide some helpful suggestions for 
export-enterprises or management department.
