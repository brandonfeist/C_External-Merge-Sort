 Abstract- Association rules are import basis of describing 
Web users’ behavior characteristic. Traditional algorithms of 
Web association rules mining , based on statistics, usually pays 
attention to the analysis on existing data ,they can’t offer effective 
predictive means and optimizing measure and can not find out 
the latent and possible rules. This paper presents a kind of 
system of the Web association rules mining based on genetic 
algorithm, which proves by experiment that it can mend the 
traditional Web association mining method of lack of foreseeing 
in latency. And it puts forward a new ideal of Web association 
rules mining.

?.INTRODUCTION 
Through analyzing the visiting behavior of lots of Web 
users, We can get the users class attributes and Web 
association rules(WAR) which describe their individuality. Its’ 
form is just like production of the First-order logic, and is the 
important foundation for analyzing accessing and describing 
Web user’s behavior characters. We can use traditional 
association mining algorithm based on statistics to dig out the 
rules correctly, but it can not do something on users learning 
procedure and personality growing. Genetic algorithm(GA) is 
a kind of searching and optimizing algorithm with advantage 
of intelligence and self-learning which simulates biology 
evolution procedure[1,2].And it will improve flexibility of 
association mining algorithm with combining GA and statistic 
mining algorithm and makes up the insufficiency of mining 
result which is based on users of specified class, and can 
capture the procedure of users’ psychology by machine 
learning. 
 
?. GENETIC ASSOCIATION MINING SYSTEM 
Web users’ accessing manner is related to a certain 
period of the accessing behavior. The users’ behavior will 
keep steady via a period of accessing and their interest will 
change with   long time passed, such as a month or so long. 
Such procedure shows self-learning and growth on the Web 
site, and usually Web users will go through . If we can capture 
the changing procedure of Web users, with association rules 
mined through machine learning, the results of mining will 
take on  the excellence of foreseeing, veracity and intelligence. 
It is the import basement of genetic association mining 
that we use increment mode to mine. Increment mining 
contains the changing of user behavior character, procedure of 
maturing, which is mainly basis of studying for GA.  
Processing log data in the Web server for a long period will 
cost huge time, and low efficiency, while large Web site’s log 
data size can be the level of Gigabyte(GB). And if we do not 
consider time persistence in the Web log , it will result in 
incorrectness or inaccurateness. Frequent items mining will 
partly lose or wrongly calculate out, if we don’t use increment 
mining algorithm. So it is necessary that we carry out 
increment mining, while it is also basis and direction of GA 
evolution . 
Fig.1 shows genetic association mining structure 
considering  increment  mining. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.1 Genetic association mining structure  
From Fig.1,We use Genetic association mining to get 
association rules on total original transaction with increment 
mining algorithm .And then coding the association rules into 
chromosomes, which we can apply GA to mine under 
direction of rule guiding from the increment t mining result.  
The results of researching of increment mining show that 
it is available to design increment mining algorithm on 
traditional statistic algorithm, such as SFUP  (Super Fast 
Update Algorithm)increment algorithm base on Apriori,

 DHP[1,3,5] . There are two cases in increment data mining, 
one is keeping the support and confidence threshold stable, 
mining the association rules on appending the increment 
transaction database into original database, and the other is 
keeping transaction database stable, mining rules considering 
the change of support and confidence. 
Doctor Cheng has put forward the FUP(Fast Update 
Algorithm) that has solved the problem of case one, but in 
case two, the calculation procedure is more complex, 
IUA(Incremental Updating Algorithm) can solve it which is 
described in the fourth paper in detail [4]. 
?. DESIGNING AND REALIZATION OF GENETIC MINING FOR 
ASSOCIATION RULES 
Association rules are hotspot  of Knowledge Discovery in 
Database(KDD).And in  KDD , association rules as a kind of 
knowledge form are usually  defined: 
X=>Y        (1) 
 X and Y are  aggregate of items, which represent 
foreside and backside of the rule. It is basic form of 
association rules in data mining . In the Web association 
mining with GA, chromosome coding, genetic operator 
designing and constringency condition is core of GA 
applying[2]. In the Web association mining structure, the 
purpose is to mine association   rules base on cluster of users 
which fits the their behaviour characters. And in Web mining, 
association rules form can be defined:  
<url1,url2,…urlm>=><urlm+k,urlm+k+1,…,urlm+m>  
support=? ,confidence=?   (2) 
On analyzing topology of Web sites,  its’ equal form is: 
<urlcode1,urlcode2,…urlcodem>=><urlcodem+k,urlcode 
m+k+1,…,urlcodem+m>  (3) 
Here, urlcodei represents code value of the url in layeres 
scheme coding ,which mainly consideres the Web 
topology[7]. 
 A. Chromosome Coding.  
This paper introduces a kind of mutative length 
characters coding scheme, while Web association rules’ 
property determines that its’ length may not be equal in our 
experiment system . 
Eg.  a association rule is list below(URL codes formula, 
the number represents corresponding in Web site.) ? 
[282574488338432, 281474976710656] => 
[282583078273024] 
That corresponding chromosome code is defined: 
2:1#282574488338432281474976710656282583078273024 
2:1 is chromosome data of structure which stands for that 
the foreside of chromosome is composed of two coding URL, 
and the rearward is one, # is character for dividing.  
In the actual GA mining, binary coding is also adopted , 
the chromosome showed  above can be also coded as: 
10:1#100000001000000000000000000000000000000000000
00001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
00010000000100000010000000000000000000000000000000

B. Designing Function of Fitness 
Genetic association rules mining is a kind of foreseeing 
mining to find out probably excellent rules ,which is a kind of 
special heuristic searching based on exist rules. It may causes 
the problem that rules mined with GA are not valid or can not 
easily to determine its’ accurate confidence and support value. 
Therefore, defining fitness function of new chromosome from 
genetic mining should differ from statistic mining 
chromosome. 
For increment mining indicates learning procedure of 
Web users, we can define new chromosome’s fitness value in 
increment mining as similarity degree that relates to the most 
like chromosome from genetic mining. And chromosome from 
statistic mining fitness value is mainly composed of its support 
and confidence. 
Defines:Fit(chromosome)=
sup* ( )) * ( )(1)
_ ( , _ ( )(2)

F Like chromosome F N ear chrom osom e
+???
  
case (1):represents chromosome mined from statistic 
algorithm.  
case(2):represents chromosome mined from genetic algorithm.  
Kcf represents coefficient of confidence, Ksup represents 
coefficient of support. 
F_like is function for that chromosome have the most 
similarity, F_near is function for calculating out the 
chromosome which is the nearest to the independent variable 
of chromosome. They both foundation is built on distance 
which can be calculated in layer-coding scheme for URL 
[6,7]. 
1). Define: F_near(chromosome0) 
If  exist, 
chromosome0,chromosome1,chromosome2,…chromomosome
N swarm, and the nearest distance between any two 
chromosome is chromosome0 and chromosome1. 
Supposed? 
chromosome0=2:1#A1B1C1 ? 
chromosome1=2:1#P1Q1N1 ?   
chromosome2=2:1#X1Y1Z1  
dis1=distance(chromosome,chromosome1)=[(A1-P1)2+(B1-
Q1)2+(C1-N1)2]1/2 
dis2=distance(chromosome,chromosome2)=[(A1-X1)2+(B1-
Y1)2+(C1-Z1)2]1/2 
If dis1<dis2 then F_near(chromosome)?chromosome1 
2).F_like(chromesome, chromosome1) 
Define? 
F_like(chromesome,chromosome1)=(1-dis1/|chromosome|)* 
[Kcf*CF(chromosome)+Ksup*SUP(chromosome)] 
C. Define Genetic Operator and Convergence Condition 
1). Selector Operator  
Selector operator’s function is to select father 
chromosomes into mating pool according to fitness value, and 
its’ scheme is betting with excellence reservation. It is same to 
the selector in genetic cluster, here the selector probability is 
set to 0.8 by experiment testing ( The detail is shown in 
conference 7).  
2). Crossover Operator 
3312
 Theory of selecting Crossover operator is based on 
knowledge tree of GA, which colony searching strategy and 
exchanging between individuals is the mainly based on their 
characters. It is kernel idea that we use GA to try, to search 
and make the knowledge trees evolve. And for survival of 
fittest, it will reserve the more high fitness value trees, while 
the evolvement results may not be the best. On the other hand, 
GA adopts genes adjustment and combination that will make 
more high individuals and new knowledge trees. Finally we 
will get better new rules in the higher fitness trees.  
There are three cases in knowledge trees for crossover 
operator:  
Case 1:exchanging subtrees in the same knowledge tree  
Case 2:exchanging subtrees between knowledge tree  
Case 3:using child node(include leaf node) to replace ancestor 
node(include indirect ancestor ). 
The three cases  are showed in the Fig.2  
 
(a) 
 
 
(b) 
 
 
(c) 
 
Fig.2 Crossover in knowledge 
 
The probability of crossover operator is usually set to 
over 0.9 in order to guaranteeing evolving speed. When it 
carrys out genetic mining crossover operator, first should 
make the allele on the same location, then exchanges them on 
each  position.  Furthermore, designing of crossover 
operator should pay attention to chromosomes structure of 
gene and the operator’s enthusiasm and scope for gene’s 
exchanging in Web association mining. Fig.3 shows the flow 
chart of crossover operator.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gene activity of exchanging? 
Conservative: That each exchanging gene belongs to same 
subtree and same layer.  
Active: That each exchanging gene belongs to same layer but 
not same subtree.  
Scope of exchanging: 
Case 1:.Only exchanges allele subtree of rules rear.  
Case 2:.Only exchanges allele subtree of rules head  
Case 2:.Exchanges the allele of whole rules.  
3).Mutation Operator  
The purpose of using mutation operator is mainly for 
importing new genes and not exist individuals in parents 
swarm. During carrying out in Web association rules mining, 
considering mutation individuals may not actual exist ,that 
gene codes is according to real URL codes, we usually set 
mutation probability quite small , as below 0.01 ,and will 
validate the new genes generated by mutation.  
4).Constringency Condition 
Usually, there two states should be regarded, and one is 
that algorithm has found the best results or steady swarms 
appear, the other is that program of algorithm have run over 
specified generations . We usually set priority later higher than 
the front. 
5).Rules Decoding  
Decoding is not too complex, that is reversion procedure 
of coding. Its process is to translate chromosomes to 
association rules, and validate rules in Web sites from genetic 
mining.  
D. The Whole Procedure of Association Rules Mining with 
GA 
In the mining system, all jobs can be divided into several 
parts. The first step is to draw the rules from  the knowledge 
warehouse which has been built by statistics mining algorithm. 
Then puts these rules into mating pool which have been coded 
into chromosomes form, and these rules are regard as father 
chromosomes. The second step of procession is to makes these 
father chromosomes to be matched into groups every two , and 
makes  alleles of father chromosomes on the same location, 
parent chromosome 
mates in evolution pool 
Analyzing parents 
chromosomes, searching 
the best matching alleles
selecting cross mode, 
exchanging the alleles 
calculate chromosomes 
fitness value

3313
 then swaps the allele directed by crossover operator. The 
third step is to makes chromosomes’s genes mutate using  
mutation operator, validates availability of these chromosomes. 
After these three steps , the last job is to calculate the fitness 
of these chromosomes, and judge the constringency condition. 
And if meets the constringency condition of GA, then do the 
rule decoding work, else go to the first step for next cycle. In 
the end of the processing  that has satisfied the constringency 
condition of GA, does the work of decoding of chromosomes. 
Table 1 shows the results to decode rules into URL forms 
with a few part of data.

? EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In our experiment system, the whole mining procedure is 
composed of several steps. The beginning is preparing data for 
mining ,which includes job of  extracting data from  Web site’s 
log and analyzing structure of Web sites topology.  Then 
clusteres the web users into several swarms  for characters 
analyzing ,and the last is mining association rules with genetic 
algorithm . 
Here,  the emphases is to find out the specialty of  mining  
rules with genetic algorithm . So we test validity and 
efficiency of association rules which had been mined from 
several algorithm as comparison from Table 2, it  shows  that 
algorithm with GA has excellence of foreseeing, that more 
association rules can be mined out in time without sufficient 
log data supporting. Using GA with Aprori or FP-Tree to mine 
association rules can find out more than that only with Apriori 
or FP-Tree and it can raise the adaptability for intelligence and 
personality of analyzing users characteristic behavior. So 
applying the rules from GA, we can guide and forecast Web 
users behavior on Web site, which does work for searching 
personality of Web intelligent service system.

?.CONCLUSIONS 
GA has the excellence of implicit parallelism, that 
Holland had pointed out that it processes mode on level of 
O(n3), but in fact it  only does the calculation only on level 
O(n). In our experiment system, GA do thoroughly calculation 
for data mining ,so that we can find out the expected and latent 
association rules in our transaction database by genetic 
learning mode. Our system is the data analyzing part of 
intelligence service of Web, and test data includes Web log 
and site topology drawn out from Suzhou University Web site 
built by the  Institute of  Intelligent information Processing 
and Application.  
Finally ,The results of analyzing show that we can realize 
the optimizing and forecasting for exist and latent association 
rules, by utilizing GA to mine the statistic mining result, and it 
surely can compensates halfway results that by the no 
sufficient visiting amount of Web users on one certain class 
swarm. Thus, we draw a conclusion that the genetic mining 
can catch up with this learning procedure of Web users well 
enough, and it is also a new research direction for Web using 
mining.
