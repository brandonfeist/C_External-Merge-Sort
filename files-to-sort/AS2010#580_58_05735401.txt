Abstract—Identifying possible viral-host protein-protein inter-
actions is an important and useful approach in developing new
drugs targeting those interactions. In this article, a recently
published dataset containing records of interactions between a
set of HIV-1 proteins and a set of human proteins has been
analyzed using association rule mining. The main objective is to
identify a set of association rules among the human proteins
with high confidence. The well-known Apriori algorithm has
been utilized for discovering the association rules. Moreover, we
have predicted some new viral-human interactions based on the
discovered association rules.
Index Terms—Protein-protein interaction, HIV-1–human inter-
action, association rule mining, Apriori algorithm.
I. INTRODUCTION
Analysis of the regulation between viral and host proteins
in different organisms is an important step to uncover the
underlying mechanism of various viral diseases. Human im-
munodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a member of the
retrovirus family with long incubation period) that can lead to
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in
humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to
life-threatening infections [1]. HIV-1 is a species of the HIV
virus that relies on human host cell proteins in virtually every
phase of its life cycle. One of the main goals in research of
Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is to predict possible viral-
host interactions. This is specifically aimed at assisting drug
developers targeting protein interactions for the development
of specially designed small molecules to inhibit potential HIV-
1–human PPIs. Targeting protein-protein interactions has rel-
atively recently been established to be a promising alternative
to the conventional approach to drug design [2], [3].
There are several computational approaches for predicting
PPIs [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Most of these approaches
are mainly used for determining PPIs in a single organism,
such as yeast, human etc. However, determination of PPIs
across multiple organisms such as between viral proteins
and the corresponding host proteins can contribute to the
development of new therapeutic approaches and design of
drugs for these viral diseases. Moreover, these methods are
mainly based on designing some classifiers which need both
positive and negative samples for PPIs. Although there are
several online resources that systematically store information
about experimentally validated interacting proteins, there is
no such resource for non-interacting proteins which should be
used as the ideal negative samples. Therefore in most of the
works in this area, negative samples are prepared by taking
random protein pairs which are not found in the interaction
database. This is done with the expectation that this random
protein pairs are less likely to interact physically, which may
not be true always. The performance of the classifier highly
depends on the choice of the negative samples.
With this observation, in this article we have proposed
an approach based on association rule mining [11] that uses
information based on positive samples of experimentally val-
idated PPIs only. The PPI information among HIV-1 and
human proteins are organized as a binary matrix with rows
representing the viral proteins and columns representing the
human proteins. Thereafter, the well-known Apriori algorithm
[11], [12] has been used for discovering association rules
among the columns, i.e., human proteins. Finally these rules
have been utilized to predict some new viral-host interactions.
The remaining part of the article is organized as follows:
the next section discusses the basic concepts of association
rule mining and describes the Apriori algorithm in brief for
association rule mining in this regard. Section III discusses
how association rule mining can be used for predicting new
interactions based on an existing HIV-1–human PPI database.
In Section IV, the experimental results have been provided.
Finally Section V concludes the article.
II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING
The principle of association rule mining (ARM) problem
lies in the market basket or transaction data analysis. Many
information is hidden in the day to day transactions tak-
ing place in supermarkets. For example a customer who is
buying nappy also likes to purchase baby food in the same
time. Association analysis is the discovery of rules showing
attribute–value associations that occur frequently [13]. Let
I = {i1, i2, . . . , in} be a set of n items and X be an
itemset where X ? I . A k-itemset is a set of k items.
Let T = {(t1, X1), (t2, X2), . . . , (tm, Xm)} be a set of m
transactions, where ti and Xi, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, are the
transaction identifier and the associated itemset respectively.
The cover of an itemset X in T is defined as follows:
cover(X,T ) = {ti|(ti, Xi) ? T,X ? Xi}. (1)

ID:32 978-1-61284-038-3/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 344
The support of an itemset X in T is
support(X,T ) = |cover(X,T )| (2)
and the frequency of an itemset is
frequency(X,T ) =
support(X,T )
|T | . (3)
Thus support of an itemset X is the number of transactions
where all the items in X appear in each transaction. The
frequency of an itemset is the probability of its occurrence in a
transaction in T . An itemset is called frequent if its support in
T is greater than some threshold min sup. The collection of
frequent itemsets with respect to a minimum supportmin sup
in T , denoted by F(T,min sup) is defined as
F(T,min sup) = {X ? I : support(X,T ) > min sup}.
(4)
The objective of ARM is to find all rules of the form X ? Y ,
X
?
Y = ? with probability c%, indicating that if itemset
X occurs in a transaction, the itemset Y also occurs with
probability c%. X and Y are called the antecedent and
consequent of the rule respectively. Support of a rule denotes
the percentage of transactions in T that contains both X
and Y . This is taken to be the probability P (X
?
Y ). An
association rule (AR) is called frequent if its support exceeds
a minimum value min sup.
The confidence of a rule X ? Y in T denotes the percent-
age of the transactions in T containing X that also contains
Y . It is taken to be the conditional probability P (X|Y ). In
other words,
confidence(X ? Y, T ) = support(X
?
Y, T )
support(X,T )
. (5)
A rule is called confident if its confidence value exceeds
a threshold min conf . Formally the ARM problem can be
defined as follows: Find the set of all rules R of the form
X ? Y such that
R = {X ? Y : X,Y ? I,X?Y = ?,
X
?
Y ? F(T,min sup),
confidence(X ? Y, T ) > min conf}. (6)
Generally the ARM process consists of the following two steps
[14], [15] :
1) Find all frequent itemsets.
2) Generate strong ARs from the frequent itemsets.
Apart from the above mentioned general framework adopted
in most of the research in ARM, there is another approach for
immediately generating a large subset of all ARs [16].
The number of itemsets grows exponentially with the num-
ber of items |I|. A commonly used algorithm for generating
frequent itemsets is the Apriori algorithm [11], [12]. This is
based on the idea that if even one subset of an itemset X is not
frequent, then X cannot be frequent. It starts from all itemsets
of size one, and proceeds in a recursive fashion. If any itemset
X is not frequent then that branch of the tree is pruned, since
any possible superset of X can never be frequent.
III. ARM IN VIRAL-HOST PPI
In this section, the procedure for mining ARs from HIV-1–
human PPI network has been described. First we describe the
preparation of the input data set. Thereafter, how to apply
Apriori algorithm on the input data set to discover highly
confident rules and how these rules are used to predict new
interactions are discussed.
A. Preparation of Input Data Set
The interaction information reported between HIV-1 and
human proteins in [17], which has been prepared based on
a recently published PPI data set [18] has been collected. The
interaction data set contains three types of interactions, viz.,
group-1 interactions representing direct physical interactions,
group-2 interactions representing indirect interactions, and the
other interactions that are predicted using their method. The
third kind of interactions are marked as ‘Novel’ interactions
which are computationally predicted by Tastan et. al. [17].
We have concentrated our study only on group-1 and group-2
interactions, since these are experimentally validated. There
are total 1288 group-1 and group-2 interactions between 17
HIV-1 proteins and 773 human proteins. We have constructed
a binary matrix of size 17× 773. An entry of 1 in the matrix
denotes the presence of interaction between the corresponding
pair of HIV-1 and human proteins, and an entry of 0 represents
the absence of any information regarding the interaction of the
corresponding viral and human proteins. Initially it is treated
as non-interaction. The resulting binary matrix is treated as
the input to the ARM algorithm.
B. Application of Apriori ARM Algorithm
As discussed above, the rows of the input binary matrix
represent the viral proteins and the columns represent the
human proteins. Here each row (viral protein) has been con-
sidered as a transaction and each column (human protein) has
been considered as a item. Thereafter, the Apriori algorithm is
applied on this transactions to find frequent itemsets and from
these frequent itemsets, highly confident ARs are extracted.
Note that we have only concentrated on the rules with only
one item in the consequent. Hence an example of a discovered
AR may be of the form:
{HP1 HP2 HP3 ? HP4}.
Here HPis, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, represent four human proteins. In
words, the rule can be read as follows: if the human proteins
HP1, HP2 and HP3 interact with some viral protein, the
human protein HP4 also interacts with the same viral protein.
Corresponding to each rule, there is an associated set of HIV-1
proteins for which the rule is true.
C. Prediction of New Interactions from ARs
We have utilized the discovered ARs that have high con-
fidence to predict new viral-host interactions as follows:
Consider a rule {HP1 HP2 HP3 ? HP4}. Suppose in
the frequent itemsets, the antecedent of the rule is true for
8 viral proteins {V P1, V P2, . . . , V P8}. Now without loss
Proceedings of 2010 International Conference on Systems in Medicine and Biology

ID:32 345
of generality, assume that among these 8 viral proteins, the
consequent of the rule is true for the first 6 viral proteins
{V P1, V P2, . . . , V P6}. Therefore the rule has a confidence
of 75% (6 out of 8), which can be thought as reasonably
high. From this we can predict that the human protein HP4
is likely to interact with the viral proteins V P7 and V P8 also
and the confidence of this prediction is 75%. Thus two new
interactions are predicted (V P7 ? HP4 and V P8 ? HP4).
This way, from all the high-confident rules, we can predict
some new interactions with certain levels of confidence.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section describes the experimental results. First the
effects of the parameters min sup and min conf on the
number of extracted ARs have been investigated. Thereafter,
the discovered high-confident rules have been reported for a
particular min sup and min conf . Finally we have reported
the newly predicted interactions among the HIV-1 and human
proteins.
A. Effects of min sup and min conf
To study the effect of min sup and min conf on the
number of generated ARs, the min sup has been varied from
30% to 50% (with step size 5%) and the min conf has been
varied from 65% to 90% (with step size 5%), and the number
of ARs generated for all the combinations of min sup and
min conf have been noted down. Fig. 1 shows the variation
of number of rules for the different values of min sup
and min conf . The number of ARs have varied from 0
(min sup=50%, min conf=90%) to 671 (min sup=30%,
min conf=65%). It is evident from the figure that the number
of ARs is large when both min sup and min conf are on
the lower side, whereas the number of ARs is small when both
min sup andmin conf are high. This is quite obvious, since
large min sup and min conf impose more constraint on the
ARs and thus reducing their numbers.
Fig. 1. Variation of number of rules with respect to different values of
min sup and min conf
B. Demonstration of Generated Rules
In this section, we have reported the rules generated with
min sup and min conf values of 40% and 70%, respec-
tively. Table I shows these rules with their support and
confidence. There are total 34 rules generated with the above
mentioned values of min sup and min conf . For each rule,
the human proteins in the antecedent part and the consequent
part of the rule are shown. Note that here we have only
considered rules with only one protein in the consequent part.
As is evident from the table, there are 21 rules with only one
human protein in the antecedent part (Rules 1 to 21), 11 rules
with two human proteins in the antecedent part (Rules 22 to
32), and 2 rules with three human proteins in the antecedent
part (Rules 33 and 34). As the min sup value is set to 40%,
each rule (the associated frequent itemset) has support>40%.
More specifically, there are 22 rules with support 41.2%, 7
rules with support 47.1%, 4 rules with support 52.9% and
1 rule with support 58.8%. Similarly, as min conf=70%, all
rules have confidence>70%. There are 5 rules with confidence
75%, 4 rules with confidence 77.8%, 1 rule with confidence
80%, 15 rules with confidence 85.7%, 1 rule with confidence
87.5%, and 8 rules with confidence 100%.
The rules with one human protein in the antecedent part
signify that among all the HIV-1 proteins with which the
human protein in the antecedent interacts, the human protein
in the consequent is found to interact with c% of those viral
proteins, where c is the confidence of the rule. For example, the
Rule 1 implies that the human protein ACTG1 interacts with
75% of the viral proteins with which the human protein ACTB
interacts. Hence it can be inferred that the human protein
ACTG1 also interacts with the remaining 25% viral proteins
and the confidence of this inference is 75%. The rules with 2 or
3 human proteins in the antecedent can be interpreted similarly.
For example, Rule 22 can be interpreted as follows: the human
protein PRKCD interacts with 85.7% of the viral proteins with
which both PRKCB1 and PRKCQ interact. Similarly Rule 33
says that the human protein PRKCD interacts with 85.7% of
the HIV-1 proteins with which all of PRKCB1, PRKCQ and
PRKCA interact.
C. Predicting New Interactions
In this section, we have reported the new interactions
predicted from the rules generated (as shown in Table I) using
the method discussed in Section III-C. It should be noted that
the new interactions can be predicted only from the rules
with confidence less than 100%. Hence for predicting new
interactions, the rules with 100% confidence are discarded
first. Thereafter, the method discussed in Section III-C is
applied to predict new HIV-1–human PPIs. Table II reports
these new predicted interactions between viral and human
proteins. The confidence of the prediction is also given for
each predicted interaction. Note that a particular interaction
may be predicted from more than one rule, but each of
these rules may have different confidence. While reporting
the confidence of such predicted interactions, the maximum
confidence among the confidences of the predicting rules has
been reported. The interaction between a viral protein V P
and human protein HP has been denoted by V P ? HP .
The predicted interactions have been grouped by confidence
level. There are unique 22 newly predicted interactions that are

shown in Table II. Among them, 7 have 75% confidence, 8
have 77.8% confidence, 1 has 80% confidence, 5 have 85.7%
confidence, and 1 has 87.5% confidence.
Unlike classification problem, it is difficult to validate the
predicted interactions computationally. Therefore, for valida-
tion, we have taken the interactions predicted in [17] (denoted
as ‘novel’ interactions) and compared our predictions with
that. Out of 22 predicted interactions, 14 have been found to
be predicted in [17] as well. These 14 predicted interactions
have been shown in bold faces in Table II. The remaining
8 interactions need more attention and should be studied
experimentally to validate the computational predictions.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This article poses the problem of predicting new HIV-1–
human protein interactions based on the existing PPI database
as an association rule mining problem. This is motivated due to
the lack of experimentally validated negative samples needed
to pose the problem as a classification problem. The well-
known Apriori algorithm has been used to mine the frequent
itemsets from the HIV-1–human PPI database organized as
a binary matrix. The association rules of high confidence
have been generated and a novel method for predicting new
interactions from the generated rules has been proposed. The
proposed method has been shown to predict new viral-host
interactions with certain confidence levels. It is needed to
validate the predicted interactions both computationally and
biologically. The authors are working in these directions.
