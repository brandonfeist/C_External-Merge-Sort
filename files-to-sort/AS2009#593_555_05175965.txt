Abstract 
 
In SCM, the problem with RFID data is that the 
volume increases according to time and location, thus, 
resulting in an enormous degree of data duplication. 
Therefore it is difficult to extract useful knowledge 
hidden in data using existing association rule mining 
techniques, or analyze data using statistical techniques 
or queries. However, strong associations discovered at 
high concept levels may represent common sense 
knowledge and RFID data represented as a concept 
hierarchy has the property that the data size at the 
lowest level increases in proportion to the item group. 
This paper has two aims. Firstly, we use time 
generalization to eliminate data duplication. 
Generalization is useful in data mining since they 
permit the discovery of knowledge at different levels of 
abstraction, such as multilevel association rules. 
Secondly, to reduce the complexity of rule generation 
by examining association rules limited to the level of 
interest of the consumer, not all concept hierarchy 
level on a each concept level have its own level 
passage threshold. As a result, rule generation time is 
reduced and the query speed is significantly 
accelerated, due to filtering of data. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The problem of mining association rules was 
introduced by Agrawal[1]. At the present time, the 
mining of such rules remains one of the most popular 
pattern discovery methods in knowledge discovery and 
data mining. Algorithms such as Apriori, AprioriTid, 
DHP, Partition, Sampling, FUP, DIC, FP-Growth are 
widely used to  find associat ion rule  mining 
techniques[2]. These algorithms focus on checking for 
strong regularity, irrespective of concept generalization 
of a database. On the other hand, in a database the 
structural complexity of data is managed through data  
schemas suitable for data analysis tasks also, such as 
multidimensional aggregations[3][4][5]. Such data 
schemas represent structural or semantic concept 
hierarchies over the dimensions of the data. Concept 
hierarchies[6][7] introduce semantic structure which 
can be exploited to reduce the complexity of data, 
focusing mining on potentially interesting mining 
queries. Recently, large retailers such as WalMart,  
Target, and Albertsons have implemented RFID 
systems in their warehouses and distribution centers. 
They are requiring their suppliers to tag products at the 
pallet or case levels. This RFID data changes and 
shares the same location and time information, based 
on each item or an item group in supply chain 
management. In addition, each item has an inclusion 
relation, in the form of a box, a pallet and a container. 
RFID data is associated with problems such as the 
degree of increase according to time and location and 
the creation of enormous volumes of duplicated data. 
However, it is difficult to find useful knowledge hiding 
in data by using an existing association rule mining 
technique or to analyze data using a statistical 
technique or query. Therefore, in order to abstract a 
hidden pattern from RFID data, an original mining 
technique is required, to find a meaningful rule by 
using a concept hierarchy and an inclusion relation of 
data which cannot be found in the database itself. For 
RFID data in a concept hierarchy, the data size of the 
lowest level increases in proportion to the item group 
size, because RFID data generate an object identifier 
based on each item, differing from bar code data. This 
paper has two aims. Firstly, we use time generalization 
to eliminate data duplication. Generalization is useful 
in data mining since they permit the discovery of 
knowledge at different levels of abstraction, such as 
multilevel association rules. Secondly, to reduce the 
complexity of rule generation by examining 
association rules limited to the level of interest of the 
consumer, not all concept hierarchy level on a each 
concept level have its own level passage threshold. As 
a result, rule generation time is reduced and the query 
speed is significantly accelerated, due to filtering of

data. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we describe RFID data and an Association Rule of a 
Concept Hierarchy. Then, in Section 3, we propose a 
method mining of multilevel association rule on RFID 
data. In Section 4, we evaluate the performance of the 
number  f rules. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize 
our work and present a conclusion. 
 
2. Related Work 
 
2.1. RFID Data 
 
For RFID data, an observational result is created 
dynamically and the location and inclusion relation of 
an object changes with time (see Fig. 1). Thus, RFID 
related data[8][9] should be expressed as an adequate 
data model at the stage of the related application, 
including tracking[10][11], monitoring and application 
integration. The expression method of RFID data is 
shown below. Firstly, grouping time range as a form of 
(EPC, location, time_start, time_end) to eliminate 
duplicated data by several tuple generation when data 
remains at the same location in the form of (EPC, 
location, time) for a certain period of time. Secondly, 
RFID data is grouped to the different location by each 
item and move and remain there, Thus, RFID data are 
composed of a grouped tuple form(EPClist, location, 
time_in, time_out), equivalently, containment relation 
information. Therefore, storage capacities are 
minimized and inconsistencies generated in reading 
data can be eliminated. Thirdly, information can be 
made more compact by reducing the size of the 
EPClist about the grouped items moving to the same 
location. For example, if 50 items from an EPClist are 
moving into two group pallet and truck, then the query 
can efficiently generated by expressing it as two 
generalized identifier (gids). Fourthly, a query is 
generated at a high level of abstraction. In addition, if a 
query is associated with interesting patterns found at a 
high level, abstracted information which is important at 
a lower level can be obtained. As a consequence, a 
query is usually generated at the less dataset and the 
original data is altered only when more detailed 
information is required. Figure 1, shows the structure 
of an RFID data object having an inclusion relation, 
which is saved in the RFID data server in the form of: 
Object_Table, Variation_Table, Containment_Table , 
based on a change of time and location. The 
Object_Table has information about each EPC tag. The 
Variation_Table has location and time information 
about each item read by a reader. The Containment

2.2. Concept Hierarchy-based Rule 
 
A concept hierarchy is used for finding knowledge 
at multiple levels of abstraction, and defines a 
sequential mapping from a low-level concept set to a 
high-level set, as a generalized concept. By a concept 
hierarchy, generalization and segmentation yields the  
relations of hidden data and shows many aspects of the 
meaning of data. Generalization is used to deal with 
the lowest level raw data in the higher level. In 
addition, it helps to clearly understand the patterns 
found, and the meaning of data. In addition, 
generalization efficiently enables mining generateing, 
by reduc ing IO  through da ta  compress ion. 
Hierarchical  mining is  a method to  generate 
association rule form items classified into several 
categories and sub-categories in transaction. A 
hierarchy-based mining technique is expressed 
adapting hierarchy concept suitable for an applied 
application type. Fig. 2 shows a result of observation 
for RFID data. Figure 2 shows event information 
corresponding to EPC, in the form of an XML 
document [12]. Figure 3 is a mapping tree, which is 
grouped by using an inclusion relation, and converts 
Fig. 2 into a tree structure with a hierarchy concept. In 
a hierarchical tree, each node existing at the same level 
has the same fan-out value. The fan-in of a sequential 
node is at the same level and the fan-in of the 
sequential node has the same value. However, the 
degree and location value of a node has been changed 
according to the variation of objects, and an enormous 
47
volume of duplicated information is generated, due to 
the fact that the information form is not generalized by 
time. The association relationship between the concept 
hierarchy is shown in Fig. 3. An e_epc:1000 node is a  
 
 
Fig. 2. XML representation of RFID data  
grandchild node of guid:p0012 and a child node of 
p_epc:100 in a tree. The table shows all inclusion 
information at an ancestor node and child node, about  
e_epc:1000 node. The EPC_list of Group id (Gid)  
guid:p0012  is: guid: p_epc:100, p_epc:200. The 
EPC_list of p_epc:100 is: c_epc:1000, c_epc:1100,   
c_epc:1200. Thus, the storage efficiency can be 
increased because each group of information has the 
same time and location value. In the tree, Node 
p_epc:100  and node p_epc:200 an create association 
rule having the same parent node at the same level. 
p_epc:100 and c_epc:1000 have the hierarchy structure 
a different level. In that case, p_epc:100 and 
c_epc:2000 create a similar association rule. As a 
consequence, many duplicated rules can be eliminated, 
when an association rule among items having a 
hierarchical concept is generated.

3. Mining Multilevel Association Rule 
 
 
3.1 Timestamp Generalization 
 
In the multi-level concept hierarchy, the operation 
of mining association rule can induce a point of 
similarity of pattern generation by generalization about 
a timestamp. Fig. 4 shows the RFID hierarchy concept 
diagram by timestamp generalization. T1, T2, , Tn 
represent information about time, which is passed 
between each item. Items with an inclusion relation, 
where all nodes are within the T1 area, mean that 
transaction generating is performed during the same 
time period. The generation of an association rule 
about RFID data uses two concepts: A hierarchy of 
schema definitions, for showing similarity of pattern 
between data, and a rule-based hierarchy concept to 
show an entire concept or a partial concept defined by 
a rule set. Fig. 5 shows the generation type of 
association rule between each RFID data according to 
timestamp regarding Fig. 4.  
Let us shows Fig. 5.  A rule, guid:p0012, is an ancestor 
of a rule, c_epc:1000, if guid:p0012 can be obtained by 
replacing the items in c_epc:1000  by their ancestors in 
a concept hierarchy. And A rule, guid:p0012, is an 
ancestor of a rule, c_epc:2000. It is does not provide 
new information, it should be removed. Based on this 
case, a rule can be considered redundant if its support 
and confidence are close to  a similarity rule.

3.2 Mining RFID data   
In order to generate an association rules based on a 
multilevel; Firstly, form a hypothesis about a 
relationship, that a user wants to test or confirm. 
Secondly, rules corresponding to the given level are 
searched, and from that, an association rule limited by 
critical min_sup and min_conf is generated. There are 
two steps involved in generating an association rule. 
 
Input : RFID Database(D), Concept Hierarchy(H), 
min_sup(?), min_conf(?) 
 
Output : Association Rules  
 
Step 1: After forming a generalized concept 
hierarchy about a timestamp from an RFID database, 
find a similarity rule corresponding to each concept 
rule, using the given hierarchy tree. We generate four 
types of rules for each concept : 
 
(1)  Ti.Parent(l:level, x, y) ? Ti.Sibling* (l:level, x, z) 
  
If the timestamp is Ti, this template finds z, xs sibling 
node, which has the same parent y as x, at level l. At 
this time, item z is at the same level 
 
 
(2) Ti.Sibling(l:level, x, y)?Ti.Child(l:level, y, z) ? 
Ti.Sibling* (l+1:level, z, z) 
 
If the timestamp is Ti; Firstly y is found, which is a 
sibling node of Item x at Level l. Item z is found which 
is a child node of item y, at the next level. Finally, this 
template finds all z, which are sibling nodes of z. 
 
(3) Ti.Descendant* (l:level, x, y) ? Ti.Sibling* 
(l+n:level,y,z) ?  Tj.Descendant* (l:level, x,y) ? 
Tj.Sibling* (l+n:level,y,z) (where, n? 0 and i<j) 
 
If the timestamp is Ti; Firstly y is found, which is a 
child node of Item x at Level l. Item z is found which is 
a sibling node of Item y. Subsequently, if the 
timestamp is Ti, y is found, which is a child node of 
Item x at Level l+n . Finally, this template finds z, 
which is a sibling node of y. 
 
(4) Ti.Child (l:level, x, y) ? Ti.Child+ (l+n:level,y,z) ?    
Ti.Sibling (l+n:level,z ,z)  (for, n=1,2,  n) 
 
If the timestamp is Ti; Firstly, z is found, which is the 
child node of y, by increasing the level of y, the child 
node of x, at level l. If there is a child node of z, then, 
the level increases by one. Secondly, z is replaced by y. 
Then, item z is found which the child node of y, until 
the last level is reached. Finally, this template finds all 
z, which are sibling nodes of z, at the same level. The 
rules defined above can find rules using min_sup(?) 
and min_conf(?) to generate a strong association rule. 
 
Step 2 : After eliminating the duplicate rules among 
the rules found in step 1, a limited association rule 
between nodes corresponding the critical min_sup and 
the critical min_conf is generated, using an Apriori 
algorithm. For example, in Fig. 4, all association rules 
in time T1; and level3 are derived by the following 
rules. 
 
 Sibling (C1, C2)? Child(C2, E3)? Sibling (E3, E4) 
Sibling (C2, C1)? Child(C1, E1)? Sibling (E1, E2) 
. 
Sibling (C1, Ci)? Child(Ci, Ej)? Sibling (Ej-1, Ej) 
Sibling (C1, Cn)? Child(Cn, E1)? Sibling (E1, E2) 
Sibling (Cn, C1)? Child(C1, En-1)? Sibling (En-1, En) 
A rule is redundant if it can be derived from a higher 
level rule and many redundant rules are extracted. The 
rules involving items from the lower level of the 
hierarchy are considered redundant because they can 
be summarized by a rule involving the ancestors items. 
Therefore, the rules are a redundant rule. We cut down 
the number of rule by removing redundant rule.  
 
4. Experimental Results 
 
In this section, we shows the number of rules which 
are generated after organizing a concept hierarchy tree 
of the data obtained by generalizing the timestamp 
from an RFID database. to study the performance of 
49
the proposed method are implemented and tested on a 
3.2GHz Pentium PC machine with 1GB main memory 
running on windowXP os . The data set is a set of 
synthetic transaction databases genertaed using IBM 
generator. Fig. 6 shows the performance of the 
proposed method on the data sets T10KL2, T100KL2 
and T10KL3, T100KL3. Two itemset T10KL2 and 
T100KL2 are respect to the minimum support 
thresholds at level 2. The minimum supports at level 1, 
level 3 and level 4 are fixed to 0.6, 0.45 and 0.1 for 
T10KL2, and 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 for T100KL2. It means 
that the more the inclusion information between nodes 
is increasing, the more the number of rule generating 
by generalization is decreasing considerably. Therefore, 
we could eliminate the duplicated rule generation and 
decrease the cost of rule generation by concept 
hierarchy at the time of the association rule generation 
between nodes.

5. Conclusion 
 
RFID database have only different time and 
location information differing from the transaction 
database. Consequently, enormous duplicated rule 
generation results in problems such as storage 
inefficiency and complexity of a query. In order to 
resolve such problems, we suggest generalization by 
timestamp and a mining technique in multilevel to 
limit the association rule generation of data. This paper 
shows that it is possible to increase the storage and 
search efficiency of an RFID database which generates 
enormous volume of data. We can reduce the 
complexity of rule generation by examining 
association rules limited to the level of interest of the 
consumer, not all concept hierarchy level on a each 
concept level have its own level passage threshold. As 
a result, rule generation time is reduced and the query 
speed is significantly accelerated, due to filtering of 
data.
