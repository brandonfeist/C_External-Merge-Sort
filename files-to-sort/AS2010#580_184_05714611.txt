Abstract— Detection of outliers and relevant features are 
the most important process before classification. In this 
paper, a novel semi-supervised k-means clustering is 
proposed for outlier detection in mammogram 
classification. Initially the shape features are extracted 
from the digital mammograms, and k-means clustering is 
applied to cluster the features, the number of clusters is 
equal with the number of classes.  The clusters are 
compared with original classes, the wrongly clustered 
instances are identified as outliers and they are removed 
from the feature space. A novel Genetic Association Rule 
Miner (GARM) is applied with this reduced feature set to 
construct the association rules for classification. The 
performance is analyzed with rough set using Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The 
mammogram images from MIAS (Mammogram Image 
Analysis Society) and DDSM (Digital Database for 
Screening Mammography) were used to evaluate the 
performance. 
Keywords- Mammogram; k-Means Clustering; Shape Features; 
Outlier Detection. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Mammography is currently the most effective imaging 
modality for breast cancer screening. Computer Aided (CA) 
diagnosis systems have been developed to aid radiologists in 
detecting mammographic lesions, characterized by promising 
performance [1].  Various CA diagnosis algorithms have been 
proposed for the characterization of microcalcifications (MCs), 
an important indicator of malignancy [2-4]. These algorithms 
are based on extracting image features from regions of interest 
(ROIs) and estimating the probability of malignancy for a 
given MC cluster. A variety of computer-extracted features and 
classification schemes have been used to automatically 
discriminate between benign and malignant MC clusters. The 
majority of these studies have followed two approaches. The 
first approach is based on computer extracted 
morphology/shape features of individual MCs or of MC 
clusters [5-9], since morphology is one of the most important 
clinical factors in breast cancer diagnosis. CAD schemes that 
employ the radiologists’ ratings of MCs morphology have also 
been proposed [10-11]. The second approach employs texture 
features extracted from ROIs containing MC clusters [12-16]. 
Some studies have compared morphological vs. textural 
features but the results are differentiated with respect to the 
features investigated, the classifiers used and datasets analyzed. 
A combination of both morphological and textural features has 
also been studied, providing promising results in breast cancer 
diagnosis [7, 16]. In this paper we have considered only the 
shape features. One of the most important steps for the 
classification task is extracting suitable features capable of 
distinguishing between classes. There have been great efforts 
spent on extracting appropriate features from micro 
calcification clusters [17, 18]. In order to reduce the complexity 
and to increase the performance of the classifier the redundant 
and irrelevant features are reduced from the original feature set. 
Rough set theory, proposed by Pawlak [19, 20], has been 
proven to be an effective tool for feature selection, rule 
extraction and knowledge discovery from categorical data in 
recent years. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised k-means 
clustering is implemented to detect the irrelevant instances. 
Initially the mammogram images are preprocessed for 
removing film artifacts, noises and the suspicious regions are 
segmented from the enhanced image and the shape features are 
extracted from the segmented region. From this feature set the 
outliers are identified and removed with semi-supervised k-
means clustering. These reduced feature set is fed to Genetic 
Association Rule Miner (GARM) to construct the classification 
rules [4]. The performance of our proposed dimensionality 
reduction method is analyzed with the Rough set approaches 
QuickReduct [19] and Fuzzy-QuickReduct [20] using Receiver 
Operating Character (ROC) curve analysis.  
The rest of the paper is organized as: the following section 
presents the preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction 
steps. The proposed semi-supervised k-means clustering for 
dimensionality reduction phase is explained in section 3. The 
experiments and results are discussed in Section 4. And the 
work is concluded in Section 5.   
II. PREPROCESSING, SEGMENTATION AND FEATURE 
EXTRACTION 
Since real-life data is often incomplete, noisy and 
inconsistent, pre-processing becomes a necessity one. 
Preprocessing is the process of cleaning the data by removing 
noise, outliers etc. that could mislead the actual mining 
process. 
In this work, at first, the digital mammograms are 
converted from grayscale to binary. The binary image will 
contain lots of white regions like x-ray labels, other notes and 
the breast profile. Normally, the breast region will have more

number of pixels than the other. Based on this idea, the cluster 
having highest number of pixels is considered as breast region 
and the remaining pixels in the grayscale images are converted 
down to zero. Then the median filter is applied to remove the 
noise from the mammograms. And to improve the contrast, 
histogram equalization is applied. 
Before extracting the shape features, microcalcifications 
should be segmented from the background of the 
mammographic images. The segmentation process [3] 
generates an image in which microcalcifications of different 
sizes are seen with the background texture omitted. These 
images are used in the next steps for extracting the shape 
features. The MCs are labeled in the segmented images for 
feature extraction. At the end of labeling, every 
microcalcification is assigned a label that is used for 
identifying it in a cluster and for further processing. The largest 
label represents the number of microcalcifications in the 
cluster. One set of shape features of the microcalcifications and 
their clusters are used for classification given by [16].  This set 
contains totally 17 features as listed in Table I. 
III. OUTLIER DETECTION USING SEMI-SUPERVISED K-
MEANS CLUSTERING 
The shape features extracted for the digital mammograms 
are normalized and stored, in which, each columns represents 
one feature (attribute) and the last column represents the class 
attribute. And each tuple is for one image. In this paper, the 
outliers are removed using semi-supervised k-means clustering. 
The k-means clustering is unsupervised in nature, but in this 
paper, the k-means clustering is combined with the decision 
attribute for outlier detection, so it is been named as semi-
supervised k-means clustering.  
One of the most popular clustering techniques is the k-  
means clustering algorithm. Starting from a random 
partitioning, the algorithm repeatedly (i) computes the current 
cluster centers (i.e. the average vector of each cluster in data 
space) and (ii) reassigns each data item to the cluster whose 
centre is closest to it. It terminates when no more 
reassignments take place. By this means, the intra-cluster 
variance, that is, the sum of squares of the differences between 
data items and their associated cluster centers is locally 
minimized. k -means’ strength is its runtime, which is linear in 
the number of data elements, and its ease of implementation. 
However, the algorithm tends to get stuck in suboptimal 
solutions (dependent on the initial partitioning and the data 
ordering) and it works well only for spherically shaped 
clusters. It requires the number of clusters to be provided or to 
be determined (semi-) automatically. In our experiments, the 
cluster number is kept equal to the number of classes.  
1. Choose a number of clusters k 
2. Initialize cluster centers ?1,… ?k  
a. Could pick k data points and set cluster 
centers to these points  
b. Or could randomly assign points to clusters 
and take means of clusters 
3. For each data point, compute the cluster center it is 
closest to (using some distance measure) and assign 
the data point to this cluster.  
4. Re-compute cluster centers (mean of data points in 
cluster) 
5. Stop when there are no new re-assignments. 
Here the k-means clustering is applied to the feature set by 
specifying the k value equal to number of classes. As given in 
the results section, the mammogram images are classified 
based on the mass type, lesion size and breast tissue type. 
According to each category the feature set is clustered. After 
clustering, the clusters are compared with original classes, the 
instances in the wrong cluster are considered as outliers and 
they are removed from the feature set. Then QuickReduct (QR) 
and Fuzzy-QuickReduct (FQR) are applied with this enhanced 
feature set to construct the reduced feature set [19,20]. With 
these reduced features set the classification is performed using 
GARM as described in [4]. 
IV. EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS 
The digital mammograms used in our experiments were 
taken from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society 
(MIAS) and Digital Database for Screening Mammography 
(DDSM). The MIAS database consists of 322 images, which 
belong to three categories: normal, benign and malign 
(ftp://peipa.essex.ac.uk).  
There are 208 normal images, 69 benign and 51 malign, 
which are considered abnormal. The 120 abnormal images (69 
benign and 51 malign) are used in the experiments. These 120  
images are further reduced to 108 images after applying k- 
means based outlier detection. And these images are 
categorized based on tissue type and mass type as given in the 
Table II. Table III, IV and V shows the reduced feature subset 
for each class based on: mass type, tissue type and lesion size. 
The performance of our proposed method is compared with 
QuickReduct (QR) and Fuzzy-QuickReduct (FQR).

With the reduced feature set, a novel genetic algorithmic 
approach called Multi-dimensional Genetic Association Rule 
Miner (MGARM) is used to construct the association rule to 
classify the images into two classes: benign and malign as 
described in our previous work [4]. The performance of the 
proposed method is analyzed with Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curves. A ROC curve is a graph between 
the True Positive (TP) rates (sensitivity) as a function of the 
False Positive (FP) rate (1-specificity). When the accuracy 
increased, the ROC curve covers most of the area in the graph, 
represents a higher sensitivity corresponds to a lower false 
positive rate. The area under the curve, Az value is measured to 
indicate the overall performance of the algorithm. For an ideal 
classifier the Az value is equal to one, or as a percentage equal 
to 100. A ten-fold cross validation method is performed to 
analyze the performance of the segmentation method with 
ROC curve. Figure 1 shows the ROC curve from our proposed 
method and the existing rough set methods. The proposed k-
means clustering and QR method has the better accuracy of 
91% (the Az value). Table VI shows the overall accuracy 
between the previous works and the proposed method.

The mass type has a strong influence on the performance of 
the segmentation algorithms. Table VII shows the Az values of 
segmentation for each type of masses. Compared to all the 
cases Circumscribed masses have more accurate detection rate 
than the other type of masses.

And the breast tissue types also have much influence on the 
performance of segmentation. Table VIII shows the Az values 
of segmentation on each breast tissue types. Here, the dense 
and glandular tissues has better detection rate than the fatty 
tissues.

Based on the lesion size, the mammogram images are 
categorized into three types: small, medium and large, small 
lesions have the pixel radius ? 40, medium size has the radius ? 
80 and above 80 pixel radius lesions are considered as large in

size. With these measures, from the 108 mammograms, we 
have 50 small, 40 medium and 18 large size lesions. The 
influence of the lesion size on the segmentation algorithm is 
presented in Table IX, from the results it is clearly shown that 
the size of the lesions are directly proportional with the 
detection accuracy. When the size of lesion increases the 
detection rate also increases.   
The algorithm was also tested with the mammogram 
images from DDSM database (marathon.csee.usf.edu), which 
contains 1792 images, in which 256 depicted a true mass and 
1536 were normal. Table X shows the prediction accuracy 
based on ROC analysis. The greater accuracy (AZ=0.89) shows 
the better performance of our proposed method.

The higher accuracy for DDSM database states that our 
proposed k-means based outlier detection method suits well for 
different set of images also. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Reducing redundant or irrelevant features can improve 
classification performance in most of cases and decrease cost 
of classification. In this paper a novel semi-supervised k-means 
clustering have been proposed for dimensionality reduction in 
mammogram classification. Initially the mammogram images 
are preprocessed and the suspicious regions are segmented. 
The shape features are extracted from these segmented regions.  
The outliers are detected and removed from the feature set 
using semi-supervised k-means. Then the rough set approach is  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
applied to construct the reduced feature set. The classification 
is performed with Genetic Association Rule Miner (GARM). 
Two mammogram images datasets: MIAS and DDSM 
mammogram images were used to study the performance of 
our proposed method. The performance is compared with 
standard QuickReduct and Fuzzy QuickReduct, with ROC 
analysis. The higher Az value of 0.91(MIAS) and 0.89 
(DDSM) states the importance of outlier detection as well as 
proves the better performance of the proposed semi-supervised 
k-means clustering approach for outlier detection.
