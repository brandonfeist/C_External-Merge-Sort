Abstract 
 
This paper discusses a metamorphosis method for 
temporal data mining. We propose definition of 
temporal type and time granularity to divide into 
segments for time, then build an event temporal space 
which may describe something change of data over 
time. We give the conception of metamorphosis data in 
event temporal types space so that it is easier to 
discover valuable knowledge, but it is not clear to do it 
if original data are not metamorphosis. By 
metamorphosis data, we study a problem of knowledge 
discovery of temporal similarity pattern based on the 
temporal type is given. A method based on self-
organizing map (SOM) to find similarity pattern is 
proposed.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
The temporal data mining has a wide spectrum for 
knowledge discovery, such as periodic patterns of  
stock movement, a temporal association rule of the two 
products, frequent sequences of  car manufacturing to 
signal jam detection. John and Myra introduced a 
framework for reviewing research related to temporal 
mining and have reviewed research contributions 
related to various aspects of the temporal data mining 
and knowledge discovery in detail [1]. The temporal 
data in the many fields is so complex that it is very 
difficult to mine useful knowledge. A feasible method 
is often used to reconstruct phase spaces, which can 
solve the prediction of complicated time series events  
[2].  
Large amounts of time series data is produced 
routinely in a number of application areas, such as 
finance, economy, process industry, experimental 
sciences, medicine, and monitoring of electrical 
distribution network disturbances. The analysis of such 
data is an important task to discover pertinent 
knowledge in data and hence time series data mining 
assumes significance and usefulness. There are many 
researches of similarity patterns in the field of 
molecular mechanisms (biology) [3], language 
acquisition (linguistics) [4], cancer diagnosis 
(medicine), etc[5]. But, papers of similarity patterns of 
temporal data mining are few. Dash, Nayak, Senapati 
and Lee did data mining for similarities in time series 
data by using wavelet-based feature vectors and neural 
networks [6].  Wang and Megalooikonomou discussed 
a dimensionality reduction technique for efficient time 
series similarity analysis [7].  
Similarity pattern is a particularly interesting 
feature that could be used for understanding temporal 
data and predicting future trends. Similarity pattern 
mining should be an active research in the fields of 
data mining. It has wide applications, such as stock, 
consumption, weather, e-business and so on. In this 
paper, we define temporal data space as reconstructing 
phase spaces by metamorphosis data. In the 
metamorphosis temporal data space, we can discovery 
similarity pattern for complex time event to extend full 
or partial periodicity patterns.  
 
2. Temporal Type and Time Granularity 
 
There exist the temporal record in many real-world 
databases, and the length of time has a great impact on

the validity of the temporal association rules, cycle 
length and similarity sequence patterns.  
Time in the real world is deemed to be limitless 
without beginning and ending. Time can be regarded 
as a real number axis, each point of which represents 
some moment, just like that described in physics. The 
interval from one point to another point can be viewed 
as some time. As a result, we call the moment in real 
world as absolute time tick (ATT), all of which 
constitute a real number set R (or time axis). In order 
to decide the real numbers which represent moment, 
we choose January 1, A.D.1 00:00:00 as the origin of 
the axis R and precision of every point on R is second 
or more precise unit. The interval from one point to 
another is called absolute time interval (ATI) which is 
a set of ATTs. For example, February 2, 2000 02:03:50 
is an ATT and an ATI can be from February 2, 2000 
00:00:00 to February 2,2000 24:00:00.  
Now, we give a definition of temporal type as 
follows. 
Definition 2.1 Let ?  be a mapping from a t to an 
ATI ( )t? , i.e., 2RR ? , Rt ? , ( ) 2Rt? ? ? ( )t t?? . If 
all of the following (1)-(4) are satisfied, then ?  is 
called a temporal type and )(t?  is called the temporal 
factor of the temporal type ? .  
(1) (Non-empty) ( )t? ? ? , for )(tt ?? .  
(2) (Monotonous) For 21 tt <  and 
1 2( ) ( )t t? ?? = ? ? then arbitrary  1' ( )t t??  and 
arbitrary 2" ( )t t?? , ' "t t<  holds, which is denoted by 
)()( 21 tt ?? < .  
(3) (Identical) For each ' ( )t t?? , ( ') ( )t t? ?=  .  
(4) (Limitary) For each ' ( )t t?? , +?<'t . 
The definition of temporal type in this paper is in 
several respects more general than the time models 
used in other papers. Obviously temporal type is 
clustering to time axis R and each temporal factor is an 
interval. Second, minute, hour, day, week, month and 
year which satisfy the above properties can be used to 
classify time axis R, and thus they are temporal type. If 
)(t? ( Rt ? ) is only one point (i.e. time tick), then ?  
is called atomic temporal type, otherwise ?  is called 
non-atomic temporal type. The temporal type usually 
used in our daily life is Non-atomic. The following 
properties are obtained according to the Definition2.1. 
Property 2.1 If 21 tt ? , then ,)()( 21 ?=? tt ??  
or )()( 21 tt ?? = . 
Property 2.2 Let ?  be a non-atomic temporal 
type and n  an integer. [ , ']T T  is a given absolute time 
interval. Then there exist n  real numbers 1 2, , , nt t t"  
with 1 2 nt t t< < <" , which satisfy )(]',[
1
?n
i
itTT
=
? ? , 
therein whenever , {1, 2,... }i j n? with ji ? , 
?=? )()( jtit ?? .  
Property 2.3 For any Rt ? , sup ( )t?  and 
inf ( )t? , then inf ( )t? ?? it sup ( )t?  for all 
( )it t?? . 
Then, we present the length of temporal factor ( )t?  
with the formula )(t? sup ( ) inf ( )t t? ?= ? . Clearly, 
the actual measure of time axis depends on the time 
unit used in application under consideration. A year 
may be partitioned into 12 months, and also into 365 
days. Which partition is more applicable? For example, 
in a geological database on sediments, days will be too 
fine as a time unit. So day is used to partition the time 
interval there. Basic temporal type helps to solve the 
aforementioned problem. Then, we give the definition 
and properties about basic temporal type. 
Definition 2.2 Let ??,  be two temporal types. If 
)(|)(| tt ?? <  holds for any t R? , which is called 
temporal type ?  less than temporal type ? . For any 
temporal factor )(t? of ? , if there is only one 
temporal factor of ? , noted as )'(t? , such that 
)'()( tt ?? ? ,  then ? is called a basic temporal type 
of ? . 
Obviously second is the basic temporal type of 
minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter and year. That 
is, each second falls entirely within one minute, one 
hour, one day and so on. Likewise hour is the basic 
60
temporal type of day, week, month, quarter and year. 
The rest may be deduced by analogy. Whereas week is 
not the basic temporal type of month due to the overlap 
of temporal factors, i.e. a month can start in the middle 
of a week. For example, the fifth week of January 
2003, i.e. from January 26, 2003 to February 1, 2003, 
falls in January   and February.  
Property 2.4 Let the temporal types ? be a basic 
temporal type of ? . Then for any )(t?  of ? , there 
exist n  real numbers 1 2, ,..., nt t t  with 1 2 nt t t< < <"  
such that )()(
1
?n
i

, {1, 2,... }i j n?  with ji ? . ?
=
=
n
i
itvt

)()(?   holds.  
Definition 2.3 Let ? be a non-atomic temporal 
type and ?  a basic temporal type of ? . And 
)()(

?n
i
itt
=
= ??  therein 
1 2 nt t t< < <"  and whenever 
, {1, 2,... }i j n?  with ji ? , ?=? )()( jtit ?? . So 
the relative length of  ( )t?  to v  is n , which is 
denoted by Re ( ( ))llen t n?? = . 
Definition 2.4 Let ?  be a non-atomic temporal 
type and ? a basic temporal type of ? . Then we have 
the following definitions: 
(1) If the lengths of all temporal factors of ? are 
equal, ?  is called a time granularity.  
(2) If ? is a time granularity, then ? is called a 
basic time granularity of ? .  
(3) If all temporal factors ( )it? of ?  can be 
classified as finite classes in accordance with the 
length of ( )it? , ?  is called a coarse time granularity.  
(4) If ? is a coarse time granularity, ? is called a 
basic coarse time granularity of ? . 
Any time granularity is coarse time granularity. 
We can conclude the following corollary according to 
the property 2.2. 
Corollary 2.1 Any given time interval can be 
covered by finite time factors of any coarse time 
granularity. 
So, the temporal types often used in our daily life 
such as second, minute, hour, day and week are time 
granularities, while the temporal types such as month, 
quarter and year are only coarse time granularities 
because the lengths of all their temporal factors are 
different. Obviously second, minute, hour and day are 
the basic time granularities of month, quarter and year. 
Basic time granularity is often used to measure other 
time granularities or coarse time granularities. For 
example, in stock statistic second and day are often 
used as basic granularities to describe the trend of 
stock fluctuation. Also we can use coarse time 
granularity to measure other time granularities or 
coarse time granularities. Month has four different 
lengths, i.e. 28 days, 29 days, 30 days and 31 days. A 
quarter which has four different lengths has three 
months. A year which has two different lengths has 
twelve months or four quarters.  
 
3. Discovering Temporal Similarity Pattern 
in Event Temporal Types Space 
 
Let A be a set of objectives, denoted by 
),,,( 21 mAAAA "= , where each iA  (i=1,2,m) has 
the same attributes 1 2{ , , }qS S S S= " , and each 
attribute iS  (i=1,2q)  includes many values e. The 
value e may be finite or infinite number (or symbol). A 
value ie  ( i =1,2,,q) of attribute iS  is called a state 
of iS . All values ie  of state are denoted by a set Ei. 
Let ),,,(~ 21 qeeee "= , qEEEE ×××= "21 , then 
( ,iA e ) is called an event. Then ( A ,E) is called event 
types space of objective A which consists of all event 
types ( ,iA e ). Let ?  be a temporal type, then 
))(,~,( tveAi  is called a temporal event for objective 
iA  at temporal factor )(t? .  ( A ,E,? )  is called event 
temporal types space. 
For example, some stock can be defined as objects 
sets. Each stock has some attributes such as opening 
price, closing price, selling deal and so on. Each price 
has real number. ))(,~,( tveAi =(Stock A, 
61
(10.00,10.12,45000),20/08/2006) means that Stock A 
has  as opening price 10.00, closing price 10.12, 
selling deal 45000 on August,20,2006. 
In fact, a temporal event may be a record in 
database. We can discover some knowledge by mining 
these temporal data. But,  there are too many 
anomalistic data in temporal database so that it is very 
difficult to discover  valuable knowledge, such as the 
price of stock. We need change value of attribute into 
other value so that we can easily find out some 
valuable knowledge, such as temporal associate rule, 
approximate period.  We give definition the 
metamorphosis of data. 
Definition 3.1 Let  ( A ,E,? )  and ( A ,E, ? ) be 
event temporal types space, where ?  is a basic 
temporal type of ? . Let a map i?  : i iE ?? ,  where 
i?  is also state value of each attribute iS . All values 
of state i?  is denoted by a set  Ei
, 
)',,','(' 21 qEEEE "= .  Then ),,,( 21 q???? "=  is 
called a metamorphosis of data from E to E for 
( ,? ? ). When  v ?= ,  ),,,( 21 q???? "=  is called a 
metamorphosis of data from E to E.  
Let A={A1, A2, , Am} be a set of finite 
attributes. Suppose that v is a temporal type, an event 
that an attribute Ai happens in state e at the temporal 
factor v(t) is represented as (Ai, e, v(t)).  
Let a set  
1 1 2 2( , ) {( , , ( )), ( , , ( )), , ( , , ( ))}i i i i J JA e v A e v t A e v t A e v t=
G G "
 ( 1 2 Jt t t< < <" ) denotes an event sequence for state 
je  to  attribute Ai  at  v(tj), j=1,2,,J. All event 
sequence set is denoted by ( , )e v
G G
A .  
Definition 3.2  Let any two ( ', '), ( ', ')i iA e v A e v

For given number ? , let  1 2( ) ( ( ), ( ),x e e e? ?=  
...., ( ))Je?  and 1 2( ') ( ( '), ( '),...., ( '))Jx e e e e? ? ?= , 
( ) ( ')x e x e ?? ? . Then  ( ', ')iA e v
G G
 is called temporal 
similarity to ( , )iA e v
G G
 for ? . Let a set  TSJ( ( , )iA e v
G G
) be 
temporal similarity pattern to ( , )iA e v
G G
 for ? , where  
each ( ', ')iA e v
G G
 in  TSJ ( ( , )iA e v
G G
) is temporal similarity 
to ( , )iA e v
G G
 for ? , when number of  element in  TSJ 
( ( , )iA e v
G G
) is enough big.  
When 1 2 Je e e= = ="  , each ( , )iA e v
G G
 in 
TSJ( ( , )iA e v
G G
) is a repeated sequence to occur. Each 
event sequence in TS( ( , )iA e v
G G
) means similarity law of 
continuous state under different temporal factors if 
there is not any temporal factor between ( )jv t  and 
1( )jv t +  for all j=1,2,,J-1. If there are all same 
number of temporal factors between ( )jv t  and 1( )jv t +  
for all j=1,2,,J-1, TSJ ( ( , )iA e v
G G
) is a similarly period 
pattern. On the other hand, let  pjj+1 be number of 
temporal factors between ( )jv t  and 1( )jv t + . If p12 = 
p23 ==pJ-1J, then TS( ( , )iA e v
G G
) is a similarity period 
pattern when all state are same in TSJ ( ( , )iA e v
G G
).  
 We propose a method based on self-organizing 
map (SOM) to find similarity pattern in ( , )e v
G G
A . The 
SOM consists of disciplinarian neuron of two 
dimensional matrix m×m, which a weight vector from a 
input vector Xi (= ( )x e ) to each neuron or connected 
unit j in output layer is defined as a vector wij, where 
the dimension value of Xi is equal to that of wij. The 
number of neuron from ten to thousand decides 
efficiency and validity of the SOM. The  training 
algorithm of SOM is as follows:  
Step 1. Give a training set ( , )e v
G G
A  and ? , a 
metamorphosis map : [0,1]E? ? , then we obtain set 
{ ( )x e }.  
(a) In each step of the iterative training, choose an 
event sequence Xi { ( )}x e?   as input vector and 
compute distances from vector Xi to all units of SOM 
so that  the winner unit, denoted by wib, is obtained. 
62
Here, wib is the closest vector to Xi  among all vectors { 
wij }, i.e.,  
      ||Xi-wi b ||= minj ||Xi-wij||                         (1) 
(b) Select weigh value wij of point in the 
neighborhood of the winner b to close input vector by 
training SOM. The iteration equality is satisfied in grid 
as follows.  
       wij(k+1)=wij(k)+ ? (k)[Xi-wij (k)]                   (2) 
where k is the number of iteration, ? (k) is learning rate 
in (0,1). Additionally, wij approaches to Xi , when k 
increases. 
(c) Then, we repeat  (a) and  (b) till all event 
sequences are trained. 
(d) Get all mapping structure set {wij} of all input 
vector Xi with corresponding to  ( , )e v
G G
A  which is 
equal to classification Cij. 
Step 2.  Find all temporal similarity patterns 
TSJ( ( , )iA e v
G G
). 
        (a)  Let i=1, j=1, TSij( ( , )iA e v
G G
)=? . 
        (b)  For all ( , )iA e v
G G
? Cij, if  ( ) ijx e ?? ?w /2, 
then  ( , )iA e v
G G
 is added into set TSij( ( , )iA e v
G G
). 
(c)  For i?i+1,j?j+1, repeat  (b) till i=j=m. 
According to the above algorithm, TSij( ( , )iA e v
G G
) 
is a temporal similarity to ( , )iA e v
G G
 for ? , because 
( ) ( ') ( ) ( ')ij ijx e x e x e x e ?? ? ? + ? ?w w . 
Let denote TSJ( ( , )iA e v
G G
)={TSij( ( , )iA e v
G G
)}. For 
given different ? , we may obtain different temporal 
similarity patterns TSJ( ( , )iA e v
G G
). 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
This paper proposes definition of temporal type and 
time granularity to divide into segments for time. We 
build an event temporal space which may describe 
something change of data at temporal type, such as 
similarity pattern. We give the conception of 
metamorphosis data in event temporal types space so 
that it is easier to discover valuable knowledge. And 
we present the similarity pattern on the basis of 
temporal type. And lastly, we discuss a clustering 
algorithm based on self-organizing map to detect 
temporal similarity pattern. The algorithm of this paper 
has discovered some similarity patterns in the web 
data. It is very significant in the practical application in 
the web page couldnt be commonly found. A future 
work direction will be to extend the work that looks for 
other pattern on multi-attribute and multiple time 
granularities. Another interesting extension of our 
work will be the development of the algorithm to raise 
its efficiency.
