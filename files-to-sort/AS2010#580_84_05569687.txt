Abstract-Mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is the 
integration of mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic constructed by the 
author and interval arithmetic. It is used to deal with the 
fuzziness of interval values. It can be used to mine the fuzzy 
interval association rules embraced in the interval-values 
relational databases.

I. INTRODUCTION 
An implicational proposition has a couple of mutually 
inverse processes: the process of establishing the implicational 
proposition and the process of employing it to make 
hypothetical inference after it is established. Classical logic[1] 
does not have the mutually inverse processes, so the author 
proposes mutually-inversistic logic[2]. Fuzzy logic[3] is an 
extension of classical logic, dealing with fuzziness. It also 
does not have the mutually inverse processes, so the author 
proposes mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic, also called 
mutually-inversistic logic with uncertainty[4]. The membership 
grade of an interval cannot be described by a single value, it 
can only be described by an membership grade interval. So, in 
this paper, the author combines mutually-inversistic fuzzy 
logic with interval arithmetic[5], proposing mutually-
inversistic fuzzy interval logic. 
Up to now, the fuzzy association rule mining of interval-
valued relational databases[6, 7] is to regard the interval as a 
single value. The fuzzy support and fuzzy certainty of the 
fuzzy association rules mined are also single values. This does 
not reflect the real situation of the interval-valued relational 
databases. The fuzzy interval association rule mining based on 
mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is to mine the 
intervals, the strength of support of the fuzzy interval 
association rules mined is a membership grade interval. This 
reflects the real situation of the interval-valued relational 
databases. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
introduces mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic. Section 3 
is fuzzy interval association rule mining from the interval-
valued relational databases. Section 4 is prediction. Section 5 
is the concluding remarks. 
 
II. MUTUALLY-INVERSISTIC FUZZY INTERVAL 
LOGIC 
Mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic can be formed 
by combining mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic and interval 
arithmetic. The membership grade of an interval cannot be 
described by a single value, but by a membership grade 
interval. Suppose the membership grade interval of interval 
[xi-, xi+] is [?xi- , ?xi+ ], then we use [?x1- , ?x1+ ]/ [x1-, 
x1+]+…+[?xi- , ?xi+ ]/ [xi-, xi+]+…+[?xn- , ?xn+ ]/ [xn-, xn+] to 
represent the fuzzy interval –A+. ?–A+ [xi-, xi+]= [?xi- , ?xi+ ]. 
The adequate set of mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is 
{¬i (interval negation), ?i (interval conjunction), ?i-1  (interval 
mutually inverse implication)}. ¬i [?x- , ?x+ ] is defined as [1-
?x+ , 1-?x- ]. [?x1- , ?x1+ ] ?i [?x2- , ?x2+ ] is defined as [(?x1- 
+?x2- )/2, (?x1+ +?x2+ )/2]. 
For fuzzy interval mutually inverse implication 
proposition –A+ ?i-1 –C+ ?there is a process of determining the 
membership grade interval of it, that is, the process of fuzzy 
interval association rule mining, and the process of 
hypothetical inference after it has been established as the 
major premise. The hypothetical inference consists of two 
steps. The first step is determining the membership grade 
interval of the minor premise –A+ . The second step is the 
membership grade interval of the major premise times that of 
the minor premise to obtain that of the conclusion. 
The fuzzy interval association rules are mined like this. 
Suppose the universe is {[i1-, i1+], [i2-, i2+],…, [in-, in+]}. The 
membership grade interval of [ii-, ii+] to the antecedent –A+ is 
[ai-, ai+], to the consequent –C+ is [ci-, ci+]. The strength of 
support interval [ssi-, ssi+] of [ai-, ai+]?i-1 [ci-, ci+] is depicted by 
Algorithm 1.

(7)     temp2=1- int- ; 
                                                                                                                                          243

(12)      then {if(int- >=0.5) then ss- = ss- =0.5; 
(13)                      else if(int+ >=0.5) then { ss- =0.5; 
(14)                                          ss+=1- int- ; 
(15)                                         } 
(16)                                     else { ss+=1- int- ; 
(17)                                          ss- =1- int+ ;

(21)      then { ss+=1+ int+ ; 
(22)           ss- =1+ int- ; 
(23)          } 
 
After [ss1-, ss1+],…, [ssn-, ssn+] have all been calculated, 
we use [sst-, sst+]=([ss1-, ss1+]+…+ [ssn-, ssn+])/n to calculate 
the total strength of support interval [sst-, sst+], that is, the 
membership grade interval of the fuzzy interval mutually 
inverse implication proposition –A+ ?i-1 –C+ . 
III. FUZZY INTERVAL ASSOCIATION RULE MINING 
Suppose we have an air quality interval-valued relational 
database shown in Table 1. 
Table 1 Air quality interval-valued relational database 
Universe Coal Consumption (CC) Traffic Density (TD) SO2 Density (SO2) 
[i1-, i1+] [0.58, 0.62] [2.5, 3.5] [0.015, 0.025] 
 [i2-, i2+] [2, 2.5] [8.5, 9.5] [0.085, 0.095] 
[i3-, i3+] [0.2, 0.3] [18, 20] [0.011, 0.015] 
[i4-, i4+] [1.35, 1.45] [47.5, 48] [0.08, 0.095] 
 
  Suppose we want to mine the fuzzy interval association 
rule “if coal consumption (CC) is high and traffic density 
(TD) is heavy, then SO2 is dense”(-CC+ ?i -TD+ ?i-1 -SO2+ ). 
High, heavy, and dense are fuzzy concepts, their membership 
functions are shown in Fig. 1 through Fig. 3.

Each interval of attribute CC is converted to membership 
grade interval using Fig. 1, then we obtain fuzzy interval -
CC+. 
-CC+ =[0.232, 0.248]/ [i1-, i1+]+[0.8, 1]/ [i2-, i2+]+[0.08, 
0.12]/ [i3-, i3+]+[0.54, 0.58]/ [i4-, i4+]. 
Likewise,  
-TD+ =[0.05, 0.07]/ [i1-, i1+]+[0.17, 0.19]/ [i2-, i2+]+[0.36, 
0.4]/ [i3-, i3+]+[0.95, 0.96]/ [i4-, i4+]. 
-SO2+ =[0.1, 0.167]/ [i1-, i1+]+[0.566, 0.633]/ [i2-, 
i2+]+[0.073, 0.1]/ [i3-, i3+]+[0.533, 0.633]/ [i4-, i4+]. 
Now, let’s calculate the strength of support interval of 
each interval to the association rule. 
For [i1-, i1+], [a1-, a1+]=([0.232, 0.248]+[0.05, 
0.07])/2=[(0.232+0.05)/2, (0.248+0.07)/2]=[0.141, 0.159]. 
[int1-, int1+]=[c1-, c1+]-[a1-, a1+]=[0.1, 0.167]-[0.141, 
0.159]=[(0.1-0.159), (0.167-0.141)]=[-0.059, 0.026]. ss1+=1. 
temp11=1-int1+=1-0.026=0.974. temp21=1+int1-=1+(-
0.059)=0.941. ss1-=temp21=0.941. [ss1- , ss1+ ]=[0.941, 1]. 
Likewise, [ss2- , ss2+ ]=[0.952, 1]. [ss3- , ss3+ ]=[0.823, 
0.88]. [ss4- , ss4+ ]=[0.763, 0.888]. 
The total strength of support interval (the membership 
grade interval) of the fuzzy interval association rule (the major 
premise) -CC+ ?i -TD+ ?i-1 -SO2+ is [sst- , sst+ ]=( [ss1- , ss1+ ]+ 
[ss2- , ss2+ ]+ [ss3- , ss3+ ]+ [ss4- , ss4+ ])/4=([0.941, 1]+[0.952, 
1]+[0.823, 0.88]+[0.763, 
0.888])/4=[(0.941+0.952+0.823+0.763)/4, 
(1+1+0.88+0.888)/4]=[0.871, 0.942]. 
 
IV. PREDICTION 
Suppose we have checked [i5-, i5+]: [CC5-, CC5+]=[0.135, 
0.142], [TD5-, TD5+]=[10, 10.5]. And we want to predict the 
SO2 density. 
First, let’s calculate the membership grade interval [a5-, 
a5+] of the minor premise -A5+. By Fig. 1, we can obtain 
-CC5+: [0.054, 0.057]/ [i5-, i5+]. 
Likewise, 
-TD5+: [0.2, 0.23]/ [i5-, i5+]. 
[a5-, a5+]=([0.054, 0.057]+[0.2, 0.23])/2=[(0.054+0.2)/2, 
(0.057+0.23)/2]=[0.127, 0.144]. 
Then, by the membership grade interval of the major 
premise [0.871, 0.942] times the membership grade interval of 
the minor premise [0.127, 0.144], we obtain the membership 
grade interval of the conclusion, that is, the membership grade 
interval of the SO2 density [?-SO25 , ?+SO25 ]=[0.871, 
0.942]*[0.127, 0.144]=[(0.871*0.127), 
(0.942*0.144)]=[0.111, 0.135]. 
By Fig. 3, [SO-25, SO+25]= [?-SO25 , ?+SO25 
]*0.15=[(0.111*0.15), (0.135*0.15)]=[0.017, 0.02]. So, the 
predicted SO2 density interval is [0.017, 0.02]. 
 
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The membership grade of an interval cannot be 
described by a single value, but by a membership grade 
interval. So, this paper combines mutually-inversistic fuzzy 
logic with interval arithmetic to form mutually-inversistic 
fuzzy interval logic. Up to now, the fuzzy association rule 
mining of interval-valued relational databases is to regard the 
interval as a single value. This does not reflect the real 
situation. The fuzzy interval association rule mining based on 
mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is to mine the 
intervals.
