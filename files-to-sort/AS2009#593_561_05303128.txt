Abstract- Supply chain Management is increasingly challenging 
in today's competitive world. The greater the uncertainties in 
supply and demand, globalization of the market in complex 
international supply network relationships have led to higher 
exposure to risks in the supply chain. In this paper, we develop a 
framework of knowledge-based supply chain risk management 
system which includes four modules: basic database, knowledge 
database management, supply chain risk early warning and risk 
management strategies module. We analyze the basis process of 
knowledge-based supply chain risk management which includes 
four steps: knowledge collection, knowledge discovery, 
knowledge share and knowledge study.At last, we define three 
simple association rules application to supply chain risk 
management.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Today's modern, industrialized society is based on 
globalization, specialization and mass-production. It is a 
society dependent upon highly integrated supply chain flows. 
Disruptions in those flows may cause devastating negative 
consequences, both for the individual company, for the supply 
chain, and for the society at large. 
Supply chain has cross-boundary and multi-aspect features 
which always includes multi-suppliers and multi-distributors. 
So supply chain vulnerable to the external environment and 
internal enterprises and come into being supply chain risk. In 
February and June 2008, Chinese steel enterprises had 
accepted Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Rio Tinto 
Australian company two suppliers of iron ore price, its price 
up to 71% and 96.5%.By October 2008, with steel prices and 
iron ore prices fall, China's domestic iron and steel enterprises 
suffered enormous losses, the overall loss of about 25 billion 
yuan. The majority of enterprises were difficult to reverse the 
losses in next two years. The same happened all over the 
world in 2008.Such as automobile manufacturing, electronics 
manufacturing, toys and clothing export processing, these 
enterprises increased production capacity too fast and neglect 
market risk. In result, many companies were bankrupt and a 
large number of workers losing their jobs. 
In 2003,The United States investigation and consulting 
firm Gartner Group had predicted that 1/5 of the enterprises 
would be subject to some kinds of supply chain disruption, 
and more than 60 percent enterprises would be quit their 
industries[1].The empirical research of Hendricks & Singhal 
(2003[2],2005[3]) also fully reflected that the risk factors of the 
supply chain had significant effect on the wealth of the 
company. Based on 519 samples of data from 1989 to 2000, 
they found that the isturbance of the supply chain would make 
the company wealth declined 10.28%. They also based on 827 
sample data from 1989 to 2000 estimates of supply chain 
disturbance for long-term effects of company wealth. The 
research found that supply chain sudden risk would make the 
normal average earnings decrease of 33%~40%. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. supply chain risk management 
There exists no generally agreed definition of supply chain 
risk management. Supply chain risk management may be 
regarded as a collaborative and structured approach to risk 
management, included in the planning and control processes 
of the supply chain, to handle risks which might affect the 
achievement of the supply chain goals[4]. Paulsson?2004?have 
developed the concept of supply chain risk management ?
SCRM? and thought that “Supply chain risk management is 
to, collaboratively with partners in a supply chain or on your 
own, apply risk management process tools to deal with risks 
and uncertainties caused by, or impacting on, logistics related 
activities or resources in the supply chain”[5].Yan-ju 
Zhou(2006) [6]summarized the major literatures that focus on 
risk identification, risk assessment and risk management 
process in supply chain. Furthermore, the author proposed the 
future research directions on supply chain risk management, 
such as risk identification on supply chain network, 
quantitative risk assessment, risk management process with 
feedback mechanism under dynamic circum stance. There are 
also several scholars conduct empirical research on supply 
chain risk management, mainly include Hendricks & Singhal
?2003?2005?and Kleindorfer & Saad?2005?[7].They mainly 
used some normal data released by market research in the 
supply chain risks and uncertainties affect the Company's 
effective. Fisher(2007)[8] examined the enterprise risks from 
the perspective of the whole supply chain and propose some 
methods to control procurement risk to Intel Corporation as an 
example. About supply chain risk quantitative research, 
research methods used are mainly financial option theory, 
game theory, dynamic ordering and inventory model, Markov 
decision-making methods, case-based reasoning methods.

B. Knowledge-based supply chain management 
In support of the Government of the United Kingdom, 
Hall (1998) carried out a major research projects, "the 
strategic partnership and the Knowledge Management 
Planning on the basis of the ability elevation", analyzed the 
hidden resources (including knowledge resources) impact on 
supply chain[9].Subsequently, Crone (2001) studied supply 
chain knowledge transfer and dissemination of the 
multi-national corporations in Northern Ireland, analyzed the 
cause of barriers to knowledge transfer leading, put forward a 
multi-national corporations achieve the supply chain 
knowledge transfer measures[10].Toyota Motor Corporation of 
Japan set up a knowledge-sharing mechanism in its global 
supply chain, with their suppliers and customers to share 
explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge resources, and had 
achieved success in practice[11].Presently supply chain 
knowledge management research focused mainly in the 
following areas: the basic theory of knowledge management, 
knowledge types, knowledge learning, knowledge sharing and 
transfer in supply chain; knowledge absorptive capacity of 
supply chain enterprises, supply chain knowledge 
management implementation, relationships of supply chain 
knowledge management and supply chain performance[12]. 
C. The paper’s research focus 
From above, supply chain knowledge management 
research focuses on the study of knowledge dissemination and 
sharing of models and their implications for the importance of 
supply chain performance. Research is rare on how to dig up 
chain enterprises knowledge and information to decrease risk 
of supply chain. Therefore, the paper focus knowledge 
management theories and data mining methods apply to 
supply chain risk management and set up framework of 
knowledge-based supply chain risk management system. 
III. KNOWLEDGE-BASED SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT 
A. Framework of knowledge-based supply chain risk 
management system 
The point of studying knowledge management of supply 
chain risk management system is to respond to the rapid 
change of the market environment and to avoid predictable 
problems in the supply chain. The object is to improve ability 
of supply chain risk management while discovering and 
learning continuously. 
Knowledge-based supply chain risk management system 
Mainly includes the following four modules:1) Basic database 
module; 2) Knowledge database Management Module; 
3)Supply Chain Risk Early Warning Module; 4)Risk 
Management Strategies Module. The basic framework of 
knowledge-based supply chain risk management system 
shown in Figure 1.  
1) Basic database module. Basic database includes all 
kinds of enterprises information,documents,case. For example, 
inventory information, the fluctuation of price in market, etc.  
2) Knowledge database Management Module. This part 
mainly includes indicators base, model base, case base and 
experts base, includes early-warning indicators, models, early 
warning knowledge, used to store the various cases of early 
warning plans. 
3) Supply Chain Risk Early Warning Module.We put 
supply chain risks into two categories: the general risks and 
the sudden risks. The general risks which are characterized by 
high probability,little harm and easy to control. The sudden 
risks which are characterized by low probability,great harm 
and difficult to control. The fundamental reasons for general 
risks are uncertainty of customer demand and imbalance of 
supply and demand in supply chain certain aspect. The 
fundamental reasons for sudden risks are unpredictable 
sudden events.For the general risks, in accordance with the 
information collection and screening, risk indicators 
identifying, risk forecasting, thresholds for alarm identifying 
and alarm mechanisms to carry out the supply chain risk 
management.For the sudeen risks, make the risks into further 
classification, analysis the impact through empirical research 
and software scenarios simulation, and then set up the general 
response mechanism. 
4) Risk Management Strategies Module. The risk 
management system will generate risk assessment report and 
put forward several feasible strategies.

management system 
B. Process of knowledge-based supply chain risk 
management 
Generally speaking, the process of knowledge-based 
supply chain risk management includes knowledge collection, 
knowledge discovery, knowledge share and knowledge study. 
First, the collection of knowledge means that data and 
information of supply chain is collected by technology such as 
Knowledge database Management
Indicators Base Management 
Experts Base Management 
Model Base Management 
Case Base Management 
Risk Management Strategies 
Basic database  
Information Documents Cases
Supply Chain Risk Early Warning 
Indicator System 
Risk forecasting 
alarm mechanisms 
general risks sudden risks
Case-based 
reasoning 
software scenarios
simulation 
agent or database, for example, inventory information, the 
fluctuation of price in market, etc. This step provides the 
foundation resources for the later steps. 
Second,the discovery of knowledge means that knowledge 
is extracted from a large amount of information. OLAP, data 
mining, and case-based reasoning are used to dig out 
knowledge. In this step, the information collected form former 
step is translated into knowledge. For instance, it needs to 
start the response mechanism when the fluctuation of price 
exceeds the warning line. In this example, what is the warning 
line’s level and how the repsonse mechanism operates all 
belong to the category of knowledge, and all the knowledge 
need to be analyzed with specific tools. 
Third,the share of knowledge implies that knowledge is 
spread to the nodes in the supply chain. Not only must the 
network spread the knowledge rapidly, but also public and 
friendly atmosphere in the network are essential. The Notes 
based on network is a software which can provide the 
approach of sharing knowledge and improving the working 
efficiency between supply chains. In this step, the share of 
knowledge is dominated by the core enterprise. A good 
example is the well-known case of Toyota and its supply 
chain, that Toyota played a core role in its supply chain. 
Fourth,The study of knowledge is the purpose why the 
knowledge Management is studied. It is also a necessary 
condition that knowledge increases in value. This step is 
crucial for the enterprise to keep its competitive advantage. 
Special topic discussion and on-line studies are viable 
approaches towards studying of knowledge. 
IV. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING IN SUPPLY CHAIN RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
A. Data mining and Association Rule Mining 
Data mining (sometimes called data or knowledge 
discovery) is the process of analyzing data from different 
perspectives and summarizing it into useful information, 
which can be used to increase revenue, cut costs, or both. Data 
mining software is one of a number of analytical tools for 
analyzing data. It allows users to analyze data from many 
different dimensions or angles, categorize it, and summarize 
the relationships identified. Technically, data mining is the 
process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of 
fields in large relational database. For example, one Midwest 
grocery chain used the data mining capacity of Oracle 
software to analyze local buying patterns. They discovered 
that when men bought diapers on Thursdays and Saturdays, 
they also tended to buy beer. Further analysis showed that 
these shoppers typically did their weekly grocery shopping on 
Saturdays. On Thursdays, however, they only bought a few 
items. The retailer concluded that they purchased beer to have 
it available for the upcoming weekend. The grocery chain 
could use this newly discovered information in various ways 
to increase revenue. For example, they could move the beer 
display closer to the diaper display. And, they could make sure 
beer and diapers were sold at full price on Thursdays. 
While large-scale information technology has been 
evolving separate transaction and analytical systems, data 
mining provides the link between the two. Association rule 
mining is one of the analytical data mining software. The goal 
of the techniques described is to detect relationships or 
associations between specific values of categorical variables 
in large data sets. This is a common task in many data mining 
projects as well as in the data mining subcategory text mining.  
B. Simple Association Rule in supply chain risk management 
Association rule mining finds interesting associations and 
correlation relationships among large set of data items. 
Association rules show attribute value conditions that occur 
frequently together in a given dataset. Through describing 
hiding rules between items in the database, we can find out 
some meaningful rules with high support and confidence. The 
following three definitions are related to association rule: 
Definition 1:Let { }miiiI ,,, 21 "=  be a set of m distinct 
default partners attributes. Let D  be a database, where each 
record represents an item of several attribute values of default 
partner who has a unique identifier. An association rule is an 
implication of the form YX ? , where IYX ?, , are sets of 
attributes called databases, and ?=?YX . Hence, X  is 
called antecedent, and Y  consequent. 
Moreover, two important measures for association rules, 
support and confidence, can be defined as follows. 
Definition 2: The ( )YX ?support  of an association rule 
YX ? is the ratio of the attributes that contain YX ?  to the 
total number of attributes in the database.  
Thus if we say that the support of a rule is 10%, then it means 
that 10% of the total default partners contain YX ? . Support 
is the statistical significance of an association rule. Supply 
chain decision makers and practitioners probably would not 
be concerned about how default attributes like profitability 
and location are related if less than 10% of given attributes 
have this combination to model its impact on default.. While a 
high support is desirable for association rules, this is not 
always the case. For example, if we were using association 
rules to predict the failure of abide by the contract based on 
what set of events occurs prior to failure, even if these events 
do not occur very frequently association rules showing this 
relationship would still be important. 
Definition 3:The ( )YX ?confidence  is the ratio of the 
number of default partners attributes that contain YX ?  to 
the number of attributes that contain X . 
( ) ( )( ) ( )XYPX
YXYX =×?=? %100
support
supportconfidence  
Thus if we say that a rule has a confidence of 75%, it 
means that 75% of the attributes containing X  also contain 
Y . The confidence of a rule indicates the degree of correlation 
in the dataset between X  and Y .Confidence is a measure of 
a rule’s strength. Often a large confidence is required for 
association rules. If a set of events occur a small percentage or 
if attributes is related only rarely with other attributes, these 
relationships may not be of much use for supply chain 
decision makers. 
The overall association rule mining in history database 
process is interactive and iterative, involving the following 
steps: 
Step1. Data cleaning and pre-processing: basic operations 
include removing noise if appropriate, collecting the 
necessary and easy to quantified information to model or 
account for noise, deciding on strategies for handling missing 
data fields. This step is necessary and important, without it 
software could not deal with the attributes and can not get the 
result as well as influence the efficiency. 
Step2. Find out all the rules that meet the user-specified 
threshold support and confidence. Because decision makers 
may not be concern with rules that with small support and 
weak confidence. 
Step3. Analyze the obtained results, and put the rules in 
the knowledge database. It is vital for all partners in the 
supply chain to share their information. Knowledge database 
collects rules and hiding knowledge of employees which 
could provide convenience to exchange knowledge with other 
partners. 
We collected recently five years history data from a 
manufacturer. All these data record all the default partners 
with detail attributes. According to the proposed three steps, 
we delete distinctive useless attributes such as suppliers’ name 
and ensure each item is integrity and all attributes are 
nonempty.  
After step 2, we could discover a series of explainable 
rules. To the suppliers default, we find out that transportation 
mode always associate with default times. The support of this 
rule is 0.3, and the confidence of this rule is up to 87.5%. 
Besides, material values are associated with transportation 
mode which has a high support and confidence. But to the 
retailers, the finance status and management conditions 
usually associate with delay payment. The confidence of this 
rule is up to 62.5%. Those rules have meaningful and 
instructional sense, managers have the ability to predict the 
default action and also can take some actions to prevent 
default occurrence. 
V.   CONCLUSION 
At present the point of the supply chain management has 
shifted from the integration of information to the integration 
of knowledge. On the other hand, the uncertainty of the 
supply chain has increased because of the effect of 
globalization. This paper analyzes the framework and the 
process of knowledge-based supply chain risk management 
system. Then several association rule mining are discussed. 
The significance of this paper is the integration of the 
knowledge management and the supply chain risk 
management. It is advantageous to raise the competitiveness 
of the supply chain in market. At last,we also think that 
implementing supply chainwide risk management is not a 
simple task. Often it is difficult already to assess risks, and it 
becomes less practical and more extensive to analyse the 
exposure further on in the chain, both up- and downstream.
