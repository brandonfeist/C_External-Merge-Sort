Abstract—This paper aims to find interested association
rules, known as data mining technique, out of the dataset
of downloading logs by focusing on the coordinated activity
among downloading servers. The result of the analysis shows
the association rules of the downloading servers and that of
the malwares.

Attack; Sequential Pattern;
I. INTRODUCTION
The botnet has a feature that cooperative attacks for
multiple servers making a victim infected by a set of
malwares [1]. For example, Table I shows sequential in-
fections observed the Cyber Clean Center (CCC) DATAset
2009, the captured packets data by 94 honeypots [2] in
which a host is infected by three malwares, PE_VIRUT.AV,
TROJ_BUZUS.AGB and WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD as sched-
uled in the same way. Although the these servers are as-
signed different IP addresses, it turns out to be a correlation
in the malware infections. In this paper, we call the multiple
infections made by several servers the botnets coordinated
attacks.
The discovery of the coordinated attacks is, however, very
difficult because it is necessary to investigate huge amount
of captured data for looking for common sequential pat-
terns. For example, the CCC DATAset 2009 of downloading
logs [2][3] contains more than 30,000 packets even in top 4
IP addresses shown in Figure 1.
There are many difficulties in identifying coordinated at-
tacks. (1) The number of infections depends on IP address of
honeypot. (2) The number of infections is not stable. There
is a period when no malware is observed at all, before after
many infections happen. (3) The complexity of generating
is high. Since 1,335 kinds of malware will be observed in
one year [2], there are possible 1,335C3 = 395, 654, 395
combination of three kinds of distinct malware chosen out of
total number of slots of 365 day × 94 honeypots × 24 hour

Figure 1. Number of downloadings observed in one year
× 3 slots/hour = 2, 470, 320, it is not feasible to examine 1.
Therefore, a coordinated attacks is hard to be discovered.
Then, in this paper, we try to introduce an association
analysis, Apriori, well-known the data mining technique
from large-scale data, in order to extract association rules
of coordinated attacks.
Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal et al. [4]. By
pruning useless combinations with the minimum support and
confidence, the association rules can be efficiently extracted.
In this paper, we apply Apriori Program [5] to the alert log,
in order for extracting the most frequently attack patterns in
a year.
The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, the algorithm
of the association analysis is explained. An example the
association analysis is presented, and how to detect the
association rules is shown. Secondly, we explain experimen-
tal data and experiment objectives. Thirdly, we show the
experimental result. The attack patterns has combinations
of malwares, and coordination between download servers.
We verify dependency of honeypots and observation time,
1The definition of the slot is described later by Section III-A.

II. BUILDING BLOCKS
Apriori is an algorithm of data mining for extracting
association rules of the form
X(antecedent)? Y (consequent)
from a given set.
A support is a probability of set of an association rule
(X ? Y ) to be shown out of all transactions N , which is
defined as
Supp(X ? Y ) = |X ? Y |
N
A confidence is a probability of the rule is satisfied,
namely, a chance of Y is true if X is true. The definition is
given by
Conf(X ? Y ) = |X ? Y |
X
Apriori is a well-known algorithm for association rule
discovery due to Agrawal et al. [4]. It allows to efficiently
discover all useful association rules by excluding the rules
those support and confidence are smaller than giving min-
imum support and confidence. With the minimum support,
we can squeeze many useless rules to be examined.
For example, the association rule B,C ? E in Table III
has support and confidence as
Supp(B,C ? E) = 2/4 = 0.5,
Conf(B,C ? E) = 2/2 = 1.
Table III
EXAMPLE OF TRANSACTION
TID A B C D E
1 1 1 1
2 1 1 1
3 1 1 1 1
4 1 1
Thus, the rule of B,C ? E is support 50% and confidence
100%. In other word, this rule shows with probability of
50%, and B,C ? E appears with probability of 100% when
B and C appear.
III. EXAMINATION METHOD
A. Experimental Data
In order to verify efficiency of our proposed method, we
apply the Apriori algorithm to the experimental data, CCC
DATAset 2009. More than 90 independent honeypots have
observed malware traffic at the Japanese tier-1 backbone
under coordination of the Cyber Clean Center (CCC). CCC
DATAset 2009 consists of the access log of attack for a
year during May 1, 2008 until April 30, 2009. 94 honeypots
are periodically rebooted every 20 minutes. We call the
time interval time slot in this paper. Observation in 2 days
gives 145 time slots. A transaction consists of malware
names that are downloaded in a time slot. Similarly, malware
downloading logs is divided in terms of time slots. In out
experiment, we use vulnerable Windows XP as honeypot.
542
B. Experiment Objectives
Our experiments are shown as follows.
1) Association rules of malware names extracted from
the captured packets data
2) Association rules of downloading servers extracted
from the captured packets data
3) Dependency on location of honeypots in extracting
rules from malware downloading logs
4) Dependency of observation time in extracting rules
from malware downloading logs
The malware names are identified by commercial anti-
virus signature. In the 1st and 2nd experiments, we investi-
gate relativity strength of the coordinated attacks from two
viewpoints of malware name and IP address. We compare
the result of manual analysis in Table I with one in the
automated method. In the 3rd experiment, we aim to extract
general association rule in the sense that a common patterns
are observed on a different honeypots. The purpose of 4th
experiment is to examine whether association rules varies in
long period.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Association Rules of Malwares
Malicious coordinated servers send same kind of malware
to a single target host. Table IV shows an instance of
sequences of malware observed in a each time slot, indi-
cating 58 infected slots out of 145 slots. The most frequent
infection observes 11 distinct names of malware at a single
slot.
We apply the Apriori algorithm to dataset of malware
shown in Table IV and successfully discover significant
association rules of malware in Table V. This result shows
all association rules with support more than 10% and
confidence more than 80%. A support is a percentage of
the slots that the association rule appears for 145 slots. A
confidence is defined as a conditional probability of malware
of consequent of the rule to be observed given malware of
antecedent of the rule.
We are interested in whether the rule of coordinated
attacks pattern PE_VIRUT.AV ? TROJ_BUZUS.AGB,
WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD marked as Table V is automatically
detected or not. Unfortunately, Table V does not contain the
exactly same rules to the rule, but has many similar asso-
ciation rules to No.5 PE_VIRUT.AV, TROJ_BUZUS.AGB
? WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD and rule No.6 PE_VIRUT.AV,
WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD ? TROJ_BUZUS.AGB. From the
observation of Table V, we found significant correlation
between TROJ_BUZUS.AGB and WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD
in Rule No.1, 2, 3.
B. Association Rules of Downloading Servers (IP address)
We investigate the correlation of downloading servers
using the Apriori algorithm. Table VI shows the association
rules of IP address of downloading servers. We specify the
minimum support of 10% and confidence of 50%.
The input of out analysis is data that consists of IP
address from which the list of malware in Table IV are
downloaded. Note that the malware name does not mean
one-to-one corresponding IP Address, e.g. PE_VIRUT.AV
is downloaded from 16 in rule distinct IP addresses.
Note that some IP addresses are assigned for particu-
lar malware. For example, addresses 114.145.**.166 and
122.18.***.123, used 12 and 21 times in rule No.1 and 2,
respectively, are mainly used for PE_VIRUT.AV.
While, rules No.3 and 4 are dedicated to download-
ing TROJ_BUZUS.AGB and WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD. How-
ever, we fail to detect the first downloading server for
PE_VIRUT.AV in Table I.
C. Dependency on Honeypot
We are interested in whether the extracted association
rules depends are honeypots, or not. We show the numbers
of honeypots that have observed the top 10 association rules
of malware in Table VII.
We investigate 94 honeypot IDs in March 13, 2009. For
example, 36 out of 94 honeypots have observed common
rule No.1, suppressing the difference of support and confi-
dence.
Figure 2 shows the number of association rules by num-
ber of distinct honeypots that observe the rule, denoted
by k. The vertical axis shows number of distinct asso-
ciation rules, N(k), where k honeypots detect the rule.
We note that using the most common association rules
using TROJ_BUZUS.AGB and WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD are
typically observed by single honeypot. On the other-
hand, the rule consisting of TROJ_BUZUS.AGB and
WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD has been widely observed by more
than 1/3 honeypots. The widely observed hosts can be
considered as ones being used for coordinated attacks. We
also note that only specific malware is used to coordinate
attack.
D. Lifecycle of Association Rule of Malware
A duration of coordinated attacks is not so long. Ta-
ble VIII shows the number of association rule observed in
Honey003 with the minimum confidence more than 80%.
Association rules are observed 365 days, Table VIII shows
that PE_VIRUT.AV is observed throughout year.
The top 3 frequent malware names,
PE_VIRUT.AV (PE), TROJ_BUZUS.AGB (TROJ),
WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD (WORM), are detected as correlated
in the association rules as follows
1) PE_VIRUT.AV WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD ?
TSPY_KOLABC.CH,
2) TROJ_BUZUS.AGB ? WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD,
3) TSPY_KOLABC.CH ? WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD.

10 PE_VIRUT.AV WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD ? TROJ_BUZUS.AGB 6
We see the first Rule is related with WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD,
which is the most frequent malware over a long period. We
note that Rule 1 and 3 contain TSPY_KOLABC.CH, which
was not found in 2-days analysis in Section IV-A.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of activities of the top 3
association rules except for UNKNOWN, defined by
1) BKDR_VANBOT.HI ? BKDR_SDBOT.BU,
2) BKDR_POEBOT.AHP ? TROJ_QHOST.WT,
3) TSPY_KOLABC.CH ? WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD.
The period of the above rules is short. The reason of short
period is that the short period of coordinated attacks is hard
to be detected. Moreover, coordinated pattern is constantly
renewed every time new malware is developed.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed an automated method to detect
the association rule of malware for coordinated attacks. We
showed that our proposed method can extract all coordinate
attacks correctly. The result of our experiment shows strong
correlation between PE_VIRUT.AV, TROJ_BUZUS.AGB
and WORM_SWTYMLAI.CD.
The widely observed rules are likely to be coordinated
attacks. As a result of our observation in a long term, the

duration of coordinated attacks is very short, mostly within
a month. It is hard to detect significant association rules
because PE_VIRUT.AV is distributed by multiple servers.
Our future works include considering the relation of time
of the malwares. We plan to apply yet another algorithm of
data mining in [6].
