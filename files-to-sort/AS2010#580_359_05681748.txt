Abstract—Warehouse management plays an important role in 
every manufacturing company. The inventory provides a buffer 
for the production plants. The Put-away process is one of the key 
activities in warehouse operations and has a significant impact on 
the overall performance of the warehouse. The put-away 
operation, if done effectively by the warehouse operators, helps 
the production plant to run smoothly. Warehouse management 
systems (WMS) can assist the warehouse operators in managing 
the warehouse. However, the current WMS cannot fulfill the 
individual warehouse objectives. Due to this drawback, 
warehouse operators have to rely solely on their knowledge and 
experience when doing the put-away process. As human beings 
are involved in the operation, mistakes and inconsistency cannot 
be avoided. Hence, as described in this paper, a RFID-based fuzzy 
storage assignment system (R-FSAS) has been developed to 
maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the put-away process 
by means of formulating feasible and tailor-made storage plans 
for products coming into a warehouse. Through using R-FSAS, 
real-time warehouse operations are monitored by Radio 
Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and a hybrid fuzzy 
association rule engine is adopted to formulate different storage 
plans. By applying R-FSAS in a manufacturing company, the 
overall results illustrate that R-FSAS enhances the efficiency of 
the put-away process in a warehouse.

I. INTRODUCTION
anaging the supply chain is one of the most complex and 
challenging processes in this global business world. The 
main objective of managing the complex supply chain is 
to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of processes in the 
chain so that the entire system can be cost effective and

efficient. In the supply chain, a warehouse, which holds and 
stores goods, is an essential component for linking the chain 
partners. Warehousing provides a time and place utility for raw 
materials, work in process inventories and finished products. 
According to [1], efficient performance of the warehouse is one 
of the key success factors that help enterprises to maintain their 
competitive advantage. In order to provide high quality 
customer service and low cost operations, effective and 
efficient warehouse operations are necessary. This paper 
focuses on the Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP) 
of the put-away process in a warehouse. The SLA problem is 
how to assign incoming products to storage locations in storage 
departments/zones in such a way as to reduce material handling 
costs and improve space utilization [1]. This is one of the most 
critical activities in warehouse operations. Without achieving 
optimal space utilization and low material handling costs, the 
warehouse operation will be hindered and the cost will be 
higher than necessary.  
There are many different storage location assignment policies, 
such as random, class-based, and dedicated storage, applied in 
current industrial practice. However, the current storage 
location assignment policies are incapable of providing timely 
and accurate decision support for the put-away process. This is 
because the policies rely heavily on warehouse operators’ 
knowledge and experience to formulate the policies manually. 
As human error is inevitable, the manual process may lead to 
long put-away operation time and inaccuracy in assigning the 
SKUs to the right storage location [2]. Besides, there are not 
many warehouse management systems (WMS) that support 
intelligent slotting (storage location selection) on the market 
[3]. Therefore, a system with real-time and automatic data 
retrieval features for the storage location assignment policies is 
badly needed. 
Described in this paper is a RFID-based fuzzy storage 
assignment system (R-FSAS) that has been developed for 
solving the storage location assignment problem. The R-FSAS 
consists of three components. They are:- i) Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) technology in Data Collection Module 
(DCM), ii) a Fuzzy Association Rule Extraction Algorithm 
(FAREA) in the Storage Location Assignment Module 
(SLAM), and iii) a Fuzzy Association Rule Container Module 
(FARCM). The DCM visualizes the actual operation status in a 
warehouse. The captured information is stored in a centralized 
database and the aim of SLAM is to formulate feasible storage

2plans for incoming products. All the extracted fuzzy association 
rules from SLAM are then stored in the FARCM for further 
use. In this way, the objective of maximizing the efficiency of 
the put-away process is achieved. 
This paper is divided into six sections. Section 1 is the 
introduction. Related studies are reviewed in Section 2. The 
design methodology of R-FSAS is illustrated in Section 3 while 
a case study in Curtain Products Manufacturing Limited is 
demonstrated in Section 4. Section 5 contains the results and a 
discussion of the findings. Finally, a conclusion about the use 
of the R-FSAS is drawn in Section 6. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP) 
According to [1], the SLA problem is how to assign incoming 
products to appropriate storage locations with minimum 
material handling cost and optimal space utilization. Storage 
affects the performance of the warehouse operation such as 
material handling cost, space utilization, and operating 
productivity. Many researchers suggest different approaches to 
solve the SLAP. [4] proposed the cube-per-order index (COI) 
policy to minimize the long term order picking costs. COI is 
expressed as the ratio of storage space required (cube) per SKU 
to the popularity (frequency of storage or retrieval requests for 
the SKU). The COI policy ranks the SKUs from low to high. 
The SKUs with the lowest COI are assigned to the lowest 
retrieval and storage cost storage addresses. [5] verified that the 
COI policy is optimal in minimizing the material handling costs 
in put-away strategy when these particular assumptions are met 
: i.e. i) the objective is to minimize the long-term average order 
picking costs; ii) the travelling cost is dependent only on 
locations; iii) when dual command order picking is used, there 
is no dependence between the picked items in the same picking 
tour; iv) certain routing policies are assumed for dual command 
order picking; and v) the compatibility constraints would affect 
the storage location assignment. In addition, a computerized 
warehouse management system (WMS) is suggested, in order 
to facilitate the storage location assignment process. According 
to [6], the WMS should be able to: 1) help to anticipate the 
problem areas, and major change in activity levels and patterns; 
2) monitor warehouse performance such as productivity, 
inventory accuracy, storage density, and order cycle time; 3) 
simplify and smoothen warehouse operations by reliably 
optimizing and communicating transactions between 
warehouse operators and equipment; 4) manage the inventory 
and material flows; 5) provide appropriate warehouse 
conditions (temperature and humidity) control and security 
(access control); and 6) allow for flexible groupings. However, 
[7] pointed out that “very few warehouse management systems 
and very few warehouses have the data, let alone the 
engineering and computer support to intelligently slot the 
warehouse and to keep the slotting aligned with the current 
warehouse activity profile.” Thus, additional technologies are 
necessary to assist the WMS or the warehouse operators to 
access the required qualitative data for the put-away process. In 
this paper, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology 
and a fuzzy logic are proposed as being useful for solving the 
SLAP 
2.2 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
RFID is an automatic data capturing and searching technology 
which consists of an integrated circuit chip and an antenna. It is 
able to send, process, and store information by transmitting 
radio waves either from or to the RFID reader and antenna in a 
real-time manner [8; 9]. Unlike barcode technology, RFID 
technology is able to identify products at the item level, read 
without line of sight to the reader and operate in harsh 
environments such as under dirty, dusty and moist conditions 
[10]. Therefore, many enterprises would like to this technology 
in their own business as no line-of-sight on the tags is required, 
even though it is much more expensive than barcode 
technology. This technology has been widely adopted in 
different business operations to identify, locate and track 
people, animals or assets. [11] utilized RFID technology and 
artificial intelligence technologies to collect dynamic and static 
logistics data in order to facilitate warehouse operations. [12] 
suggested implanting RFID tags into human teeth for human 
identification purposes. [13] suggested the use of RFID to 
capture the status of the mould while it is being manufactured. 
2.3 Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Association Rule Mining 
Data Mining (DM) involves selecting, exploring, modeling and 
analyzing data in huge databases with an objective to uncover 
previously unknown yet useful associations, patterns and 
knowledge [14]. 
Fuzzy set theory provides the mechanism for carrying out 
approximate reasoning processes when available information is 
uncertain, incomplete, imprecise, or vague [15]. Fuzzy sets deal 
with the type of uncertainty that arises when the boundaries of a 
class of objects are not sharply defined and cope with the 
concept of “partial truth’, which can compensate for the 
deficiencies of classical mathematical models [15]. Fuzzy logic 
enables the qualitative and inexact nature of human reasoning 
to be harnessed. [16] stated that the use of fuzzy logic which 
reflects the qualitative and inexact nature of human reasoning 
can enable expert systems to be more resilient. With fuzzy 
logic, the precise value of a variable is replaced by a linguistic 
description the meaning of which is represented by a fuzzy set. 
Fuzzy logic is able to incorporate the human knowledge in 
system [17]. [18] used the fuzzy logic to solve the distribution 
network reconfiguration problem. [19] stated that fuzzy logic 
can be used to solve the problems related to decision making 
with the aim of optimizing one or more objectives. Thus, this 
has proven that fuzzy logic can be used to meet the 
multi-objectives of put-away activity in warehouse operations. 
Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (Fuzzy AR-Mining) is an even 
more powerful DM technique which is an integration of Fuzzy 
Sets and AR-Mining. It is practical to the real world 
applications as it can deal with fuzzy taxonomies which are 
characterized with vagueness [20]. Due to the great benefits 
brought by Fuzzy AR-Mining, it is widely applied in various 
areas such as business sector to boost profits. [21] have 
proposed a process mining system using Fuzzy AR-Mining 
aims at discovering the hidden relationships in a supply chain 
network to support continuous quality improvement that allows 
greater customer satisfaction. [22] have put out an algorithm for 
discovering fuzzy periodic association rules in fuzzy periodic 
3calendars. Internet providers may benefit by better 
understanding periodic client access behaviors and hence offer 
better services to them. 
III. METHODOLOGY
When there are SKUs that need to be stored, the warehouse 
operators have to make a decision based on the Put-away 
Decision Tree on where the SKUs should be put. The Put-away 
Decision Tree consists of 4 major layers as shown in Figure 1.
This means that the warehouse operators would have to go 
through the 4 layers before the location decision can be 
successfully made. The decision tree starts from the top with 
selection of the warehouse followed by selection of the storage 
zone, then the storage location and finally reaching the bottom 
layer, namely the tier selection. All these decisions are based on 
the operators’ knowledge and experience. Therefore, the 
put-away process is quite inefficient and time-consuming while 
the decisions are rather subjective and inconsistent, that is, 
different operators may make different storage location 
decisions for the same SKU. Apart from this, as the put-away 
process relies heavily on manual operation, the operators 
responsible for such decision making would normally have to 
stick to the same task which leads to inflexible scheduling of 
operators and warehouse management.  
Figure 1 - Put-away Decision Tree 
In order to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
put-away process, the RFID-based fuzzy storage assignment 
system (R-FSAS) is proposed. Figure 2 illustrates the system 
architecture of R-FSAS. With this new system, the necessary 
data is collected and analyzed to extract the experts’ knowledge 
involved in the put-away process. Once the knowledge is 
extracted, it is stored in the form of fuzzy association rules. 
These rules help determine a suitable storage location for the 
incoming SKU. Faster and more efficient storage location 
decisions can then be made without much human intervention. 
The R-FSAS consists of three components which make this 
possible, namely (i) a Data Collection Module, (ii) a Storage 
Location Analysis Module (SLAM) and (iii) a Fuzzy 
Association Rule Container Module. 
Figure 2 - System Architecture of R-FSAS 
(i) Data Collection Module 
To automate the put-away process, certain data must be first 
collected to analyze the hidden rules used to make such storage 
location assignment decisions. Data such as the features of the 
SKUs to be stored and their assigned storage locations are some 
of the necessary data which have to be collected beforehand. 
Some examples of SKU features are their dimensions, weights, 
loading values and popularity. All these are important in order 
to find out the relationship between the SKU features and the 
assigned storage location.        
This data collection process is very time-consuming and 
error-inducing if it is done manually, so in order to facilitate 
this tedious process, RFID is introduced to help. With RFID 
technology, each SKU has a RFID tag attached to it which 
contains all the necessary information related to the 
corresponding SKU. When the SKUs arrive, their information 
can be easily collected as they pass through the gate where their 
RFID tags are scanned automatically. Apart from facilitating 
this data collection process, this procedure is also useful to the 
proposed automated put-away process as the details of each 
SKU are known before a suitable storage location is generated 
for it.  
(ii) Storage Location Analysis Module (SLAM) 
After all necessary data are collected and stored; they are 
passed to the Storage Location Analysis Module (SLAM). The 
SLAM is equipped with a Fuzzy Association Rule Extraction 
Algorithm (FAREA) which helps analyze the data collected 
and extracts the hidden rules linking the SKU features and SKU 
storage location. The notation and the mechanism of FAREA 
4are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively.  
Figure 4 – The Notation of FARCA 
The SLAM represents the extracted rules in the form of 
fuzzy association rules where the “IF” condition would be 
something about the SKU features while the “THEN” result 
would be something about the assigned storage location as 
shown in Figure 6.
Figure 5 - Mechanism of FAREA 
(iii) Fuzzy Association Rule Container Module 
After the collected data have gone through the SLAM, a set 
of fuzzy association rules giving directions on how SKUs 
should be assigned to their storage locations is generated. These 
extracted fuzzy association rules are then stored in the Fuzzy 
Association Rule Container waiting to be used. The whole 
process above is repeated and looped before a set of 
comprehensive and practical rules can be generated and put into 
practice. However, once this is all done, the put-away process 
will no longer require labor to make the storage location 
assignment decisions. The whole process will be done 
automatically from passing the SKUs through the RFID gate, to 
reading the attached RFID tags, to generating their assigned 
storage locations. The put-away process can thus be enhanced 
in terms of its efficiency and accuracy.

IV. CASE STUDY
Curtain Products Manufacturing Limited is a China based 
manufacturer. It provides multi-categories of products, such as 
window fashions, indoor and outdoor furniture, industrial 
tooling, machinery, and industrial components. Besides, it also 
provides industrial solutions to customers. It is set up with a 
highly vertical integration capability and is capable of 
undertaking product design, all kinds of tooling, plastic 
injection molding, aluminum extrusion, stamping, and wood 
based production. In addition, it has different kinds of surfacing 
capability such as powder coating, aluminum anodizing, 
electrical plating, and lacquering. The size of the 
manufacturing plant is up to 45,000 m2 and it employs around 
500 skilled workers. Its total annual revenue is currently more 
than US$13 million. The company vision is to provide clients 
with valuable products and services at competitive cost and 
with a high degree of efficiency. 
In the case company, there is a warehouse which stores the raw 
materials and semi-finished products. However, there is no 
computerized system in the warehouse to keep track of the 
SKUs. The warehouse operators pick up and store the SKUs 
according to their experience and daily practice. They may 
have difficulty in identifying the correct storage location for the 
incoming SKUs. Also, it takes the warehouse operators a long 
time to find and pick up the SKUs from the storage location and 
take them to the production plant. Thus, the put-away operation 
is inefficient. Customers require high quality products and a 
short lead time. The inefficient warehouse operation will 
disappoint customers since it may delay the delivery of the raw 
materials and semi-finished products to the production plants 
and cause interruptions to the production process.  
Existing Workflow of the case company 
Figure 7 shows the current practice of handling the incoming 
SKUs in the case company. The current practice of handling the 
incoming SKUs starts with receiving the raw materials from 
suppliers. The supplier has to submit the delivery note to the 
warehouse manager and the manager will see whether the raw 
materials are required urgently such as in a case of emergency. 
If those raw materials are needed urgently for production, they 
are delivered to the production material preparation area for 
temporary storage. If the need is not so urgent, then the raw 
materials will be delivered to the warehouse. Warehouse 
operators needs to check the quantity of the purchase order with 
what is written on the delivery note and then check the quality 
of the materials. When the materials do not pass the quality 
inspection, they are returned to the supplier. If the materials 
pass the quality inspection, the quantity of materials are 
checked by the warehouse operators. Any mistake in the 
quantity of materials ordered is reported to the purchasing 
department. If the quantity of materials is correct, the urgently 
needed materials are delivered to production plants 
immediately and those that are not so urgently needed are 
stored in the storage location. The warehouse manager has to 
decide where to store the incoming raw materials. Finally, the 
warehouse operators record the storage data.  
Beside raw materials, semi-finished products are also stored in 
the same warehouse so as to achieve the benefits of mass 
production and avoid delay in the production process. The 
warehouse operators deliver the semi-finished products from 
the production plants to the warehouse. Then they check the 
quality and quantity of those semi-finished products. If all of 
them are correct, they are stored in a storage location and 
warehouse operators record the storage data. Otherwise, the 
semi-finished products are transferred back to the production 
plants. The warehouse manager also needs to decide where to 
store these semi-finished products. 
The current practice of the case company is that the warehouse 
manager decides all the SLAP decisions based on his 
experience. When the storage location is found, the warehouse 
operators put the SKUs in that location and store them. The 
storage data are recorded by hand using a pen. 
6Figure 7 - Workflow of incoming SKUs in the case company 
In the storage location selection process, the physical 
parameters such as the dimensions, weight and product value of 
SKU (Figure 8) play the dominant role. When the information 
of these parameters is available, the put-away decision can be 
made appropriately. However, assigning the incoming SKUs to 
the storage location in the warehouse is complicated as several 
factors are affect the put-away decision. The major issue is the 
material handling cost which depends on the travelling distance 
between the storage location and the entrance to the warehouse. 
One of the objectives in warehouse management is to minimize 
the material handling cost i.e. to shorten the distance that SKUs 
have to be moved. Activities associated with the SKUs 
activities include popularity (frequency of demand), turnover, 
cube movement, and pick density, significantly influence the 
total material handling cost in the warehouse. For example, 
when the SKUs have a high popularity, they should be stored in 
the most accessible zone in order to reduce the travelling 
distance and time. Therefore, the warehouse manager has to 
capture all the parameters of SKU activities and use his 
knowledge and experience to complete the task in an efficient 
way. 
In selecting the tier level when placing pallets on racks for 
storing the incoming SKUs, the objective in this task is to 
minimize the damage and loss of the SKUs during the put-away 
and storage process. The safety of the warehouse operators is 
also important. They may easily get injured when they put a 
heavy item on a high level tier. In warehouse practice, storing 
the heavier SKUs in the higher tiers of the pallet racks makes it 
easier for damage to occur during the put-away process. The 
more expensive the SKUs, the greater the loss to the company if 
any damage is caused. Therefore, the warehouse manager 
needs to consider the weight and value of the SKUs when 
making the put-away decisions.  
From the above problems and current practice of the case 
company, quality storage data are necessary in SLAP. However, 
there is no advanced IT system in the company such as the 
WMS, vendor managed inventory (VMI) or enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) systems. Data cannot be transmitted from one 
department to another. Warehouse managers cannot access the 
quality data from other departments. Hence, a central data 
warehouse is needed in the company.  
Figure 8 - Some Examples of Parameters in the SLAP 
Experiment of R-FSAS In order to demonstrate the flexibility 
of the proposed methodology, a supplier delivery order is 
chosen and inputted into the R-FSAS. It is assumed that the 
purchasing department has ordered the raw materials from a 
supplier. The warehouse department receives the delivery order 
from the supplier. The no. of delivery order is 10032911. After 
the purchasing department enters the relevant data into the 
database by using RFID technology, the warehouse operators 
have to start to go through the procedure shown on the 
put-away decision tree. The warehouse operators can access the 
decision support data with the help of the Fuzzy Association 
Rule Container Module. They can get the critical information 
by selecting the storage location for that particular SKU, such 
as the loading length, loading width, loading height, loading 
weight and loading cube for that delivery order from the 
supplier.  
Besides this, the warehouse operators can also view the 
decision support data including popularity, turnover, cube 
movement, pick density of the SKU for the storage location 
selection. These decision support data help the warehouse 
operators to select the most appropriate location (golden zone, 
silver zone or bronze zone). In order to select the tier level for 
the SKU, the warehouse operators have to know the loading 
height, loading length, loading width, loading weight , loading 
cube and loading value of that delivery order. These decision 
support data help the staff to choose the best tier level (T1, T2, 
T3 or T4).  
7The fuzzy association rules extracted from the historical data 
will be stored in the Fuzzy Association Rule Container Module 
and used to suggest the put-away decisions for the case 
company. In the put-away decision, the fuzzy outputs need to 
be generated, i.e. storage location (golden, silver or bronze zone) 
and tier level (tier 1, 2, 3 or 4). The parameters required to 
perform the put-away process are popularity, turnover, cube 
movement, pick density, loading height, loading length, 
loading width, loading weight, loading cube and loading value 
The warehouse operators have to input these parameters into 
the fuzzy system to find out the best storage location and most 
suitable tier level for the delivery order.  
V. CONCLUSION
This research has proposed a hybrid technique that enjoys the 
advantages of RFID, fuzzy sets and association rule extraction 
to provide decision support functionality for improved 
warehouse management. The developed methodology is able to 
discover the hidden knowledge and in turn help with the 
strategic decision making process for solving storage location 
assignment problems. It also provides a way for firms to better 
understand the changing business landscape, while the main 
objective is to assist companies to achieve greater operational 
efficiency, more efficient managerial arrangements, greater end 
customer satisfaction and most importantly, superior overall 
company performance.  
However, the disadvantage is that the proposed methodology 
may need much computational time to perform the tasks and a 
sound data collection and integration system has to be 
developed before the system can be implemented.
