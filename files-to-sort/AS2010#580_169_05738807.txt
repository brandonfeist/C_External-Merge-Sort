Abstract— Data mining is the process of extracting hidden 
information from the database. Data mining is emerging as one 
of the key features of many business organizations. The current 
trend in business collaboration shares the data and mined results 
to gain mutual benefit. The problem of privacy-preserving data 
mining has become more important in recent years because of 
the increasing ability to store personal data about users, and the 
increasing sophistication of data mining algorithms to leverage 
this information. Apart from classification and regression, one of 
the most important tasks of data mining is to find patterns in 
data. In particular, new advances in data mining and knowledge 
discovery that allow for the extraction of hidden knowledge in 
enormous amount of data impose new threats on the seamless 
integration of information. In this paper, we consider the 
problem of building privacy preserving algorithms for one 
category of data mining techniques, the association rule mining. 
 
Keywords— Data Mining, Privacy Preserving Data Mining,  
Association rule.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Data mining is a recently emerging field, connecting the 
three worlds of Databases, Artificial Intelligence and 
Statistics. The information age has enabled many 
organizations to gather large volumes of data. However, the 
usefulness of this data is negligible if “meaningful 
information” or “knowledge” cannot be extracted from it. 
Data mining, otherwise known as knowledge discovery, 
attempts to answer this need. In contrast to standard statistical 
methods, data mining techniques search for interesting 
information without demanding a priori hypotheses. Privacy-
preserving data mining considers the problem of running data 
mining algorithms on confidential data that is not supposed to 
be revealed even to the party running the algorithm. There are 
two classic settings for privacy-preserving data mining 
(although these are by no means the only ones). 
In the first, the data is divided among two or more different 
parties; the aim being to run a data mining algorithm on the 
union of the parties' databases without allowing any party to 
view another individual's private data. A classical example of 
a privacy-preserving data mining Problem of the first type 
occurs in the field of medical research. Consider the case of a 
number of different hospitals that wish to jointly mine their 
patient data for the purpose of medical research. Furthermore, 
let us assume that privacy policy and law prevents these 
hospitals from ever pooling their data or revealing it to each 
other, due to the confidentiality of patient records. This is 
another example where privacy-preserving data mining could 
be used to balance real privacy concerns with the needs of 
governments to carry out important research. 
Association rule algorithms produce thousands of rules, 
many of which are redundant (Li & Zhang, 2003; McGarry, 
2005). In order to filter the rules, the user generally supplies a 
minimum threshold for support and confidence. [1] Support 
and confidence are basic measures of association rule 
interestingness. Additionally, these are the most common 
measures of interest. However, generating rules that meet 
minimum thresholds for support and confidence may not be 
interesting. This is because rules are often produced that are 
already known by a user who is familiar with the application 
domain. The challenge in association rule mining (ARM) 
essentially becomes one of determining which rules are the 
most interesting. With so many interestingness rules to choose 
from, it is difficult to determine which one to use for a given 
domain. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different 
interestingness measures produce different results for the 
same data set, thus making it difficult for the user to interpret 
the measures (McGarry, 2005). 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we present an overview of Association rule mining. Section 3 
discusses about association rule techniques. Section 4 gives a 
review on Association rule hiding in privacy preserving data 
mining .Section 5 discusses about interesting measures in 
Association rule mining.  Analyses of papers are given in 
Section 6.Conclusion are given in section 7.  
II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING 
Association rule hiding refers to the process of 
modifying the original database in such a way that certain 
sensitive association rules disappear without seriously 
affecting the data and the non-sensitive rules. Association rule

mining is defined as: Let be a set 
of n binary attributes called items. Let 
be a set of transactions called 
the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction 
ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is defined as 
an implication of the form X?Y where  
and . The sets of items (for 
short item sets) X and Y are called antecedent (left-hand-side 
or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS) of the rule 
respectively 
• The support supp(X) of an item set X is defined as 
the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the 
item set. In the example database, the item set {milk, bread} 
has a support of 2 / 5 = 0.4 since it occurs in 40% of all 
transactions (2 out of 5 transactions). 
• The confidence of a rule is defined 
 
      For example, the rule  has a 
confidence of 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5 in the database, which means that 
for 50% of the transactions containing milk and bread the rule 
is correct. 
     Yehuda Lindell, Benny Pinkas introduce The issue of 
privacy preserving data mining. Specifically, we consider a 
scenario in which two parties owning confidential databases 
wish to run a data mining algorithm on the union of their 
databases, without revealing any unnecessary information. 
This work is motivated by the need to both protect privileged 
information and enable its use for research or other 
purposes[12].  
      The above problem is a specific example of secure multi-
party computation and as such, can be solved using known 
generic protocols. However, data mining algorithms are 
typically complex and, furthermore, the input usually consists 
of massive data sets. The generic protocols in such a case are 
of no practical use and therefore more efficient protocols are 
required. We focus on the problem of decision tree learning 
with the popular ID3 algorithm. Our protocol is considerably 
more efficient than generic solutions and demands both very 
few rounds of communication and reasonable bandwidth. 
      Lee and Siau captures Data mining algorithms should be 
flexible enough to deal with data from different sources. 
Finally, a major concern within data mining today is the threat 
to privacy and data security. This is because data mining 
makes it easy to establish profiles of individuals based on data 
from multiple sources. 
      One research team (Lee & Siau, 2001) outlined the 
requirements and challenges associated with data mining.  
• Data mining must be able to handle different types of 
data. 
• Data mining algorithms must be scalable and 
efficient. 
• Data mining must be able to handle noisy and 
missing data. 
• Data mining techniques should present results in a 
way that is easy to understand. 
• Data mining techniques should support requests at 
different levels of granularity. That is, data   mining 
can be done at different levels of abstraction. 
 Murat Kantarcioglu, Chris Clifton proposed Data mining 
can extract important knowledge from large data collections. 
These collections are split among various parties. Privacy 
concerns may prevent the parties from directly sharing the 
data and some types of information’s about the data. This 
addresses secure mining of association rule over horizontally   
partitioned data.[7] The methods incorporate cryptographic 
techniques to minimize the information shared, while adding 
little overhead to the mining task. 
Matthew Eric Otey, Chao Wang, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, 
Adriano Veloso, Wagner Meria introduce Traditional methods 
for frequent itemset mining typically assume that details 
centralized and static. Such method supposes excessive 
communication overhead when data is distributed, and they 
waste computational resources when data is dynamic. First 
unified approach that overcomes these assumptions. These 
approaches makes use of parallel and incremental technique to 
generate frequent itemsets in the presence of data updates 
without examining the entire database and imposes minimal 
communication overhead when mining distributed databases. 
These approaches are able to generate both local and global 
frequent itemsets. [5] This ability permits our approach to 
identify high contrast frequent item sets, which allows one to 
examine how the data is skewed over different sites. 
Juliano Brito Da Justa, Marina Teresa Pires Vieria, Marina 
Teresa, Pires Vieira introduce Parallel and distributed 
association rule mining are very important research subjects, 
with various work addressing them. Data skewness, which 
describes the degree of non-uniformity of the itemset 
distribution among database partitions, causes various 
problems to parallel and distributed association rule mining 
algorithms, such as the generation of many false candidate 
itemsets. Some algorithms employ techniques in order to not 
only overcome these problems but also to take advantage of 
data skewness with the purpose of improving their 
performance. For instance, some algorithms employ skewness 
based pruning techniques. In the literature, an entropy-based 
metric has been used for measuring data skewness. A method 
for identifying skewed itemsets which uses tests of statistical 
hypotheses. [4] This method has some advantages over the 
entropy-based method and can also be used in environments 
with privacy-preserving constraints. 
Gediminas Adomavicius, Alexander Tuzhilin proposed an 
overview of the field of recommender systems and describes 
the current generation of recommendation methods that are 
usually classified into the following three main categories 
(2005) content-based, collaborative, and hybrid 
recommendation approaches. The various limitations of 
current recommendation methods and discusses possible 
extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and 
make recommender systems applicable to an even broader 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Communication and Computational Intelligence – 2010

range of applications. These extensions include, among others, 
an improvement of understanding of users and items, 
incorporation of the contextual information into the 
recommendation process, support for multcriteria ratings, and 
a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of 
recommendations. 
Kotsiantis and Kanellopoulos proposed Association rule 
mining is a category of data mining tasks that correlate a set of 
items with other sets of items in a database. Association rules 
"aim to extract interesting correlations, frequent patterns, 
associations or causal structures among sets of items in the 
transaction databases or other repositories”. 
Sheng Zhong introduces Standard algorithms for 
association rule mining is based on identification of frequent 
itemsets. How to maintain privacy in distributed mining of 
frequent itemsets. Two (or more) parties can find frequent 
itemsets in a distributed database without revealing each 
party's portion of the data to the other.[11] The existing 
solution for vertically partitioned data leaks a significant 
amount of information, while the existing solution for 
horizontally partitioned data only works for three parties or 
more. The design algorithms for both vertically and 
horizontally partitioned. 
Dan Bogdanov , Richard Sassoon proposed The statistical 
analysis of data warehouses, i.e., repositories for an 
organization’s data, is used for finding patterns or trends that 
are useful in decision making. This process is often called data 
mining. One way to use such data is through collaborative 
ltering, in which suggestions are given to a user based on 
previous transactions of other users. The question of privacy 
in this context is important, since one doesn’t want to disclose 
his private transaction in order to perform this analysis. This is 
so even, if disclosing this information gives the user to some 
service. An alternative solution to cryptographic and statistical 
randomization algorithms for privacy preserving association-
rule mining for collaborative, ltering applications. [3] This is 
achieved by using a multi-purpose framework. 
Mohammad Naderi Dehkordi, Kambiz Badie, Ahmad 
Khadem Zadeh proposed Extracting of knowledge form large 
amount of data is an important issue in data mining systems. 
One of most important activities in data mining is association 
rule mining and the new head for data mining research area is 
privacy of mining.[8] Today association rule mining has been 
a hot research topic in Data Mining and security area. A lot of 
research has done in this area but most of them focused on 
perturbation of original database heuristically. Therefore the 
final accuracy of released database falls down intensely. In 
addition to accuracy of database the main aspect of security in 
this area is privacy of database that is not warranted in most 
heuristic approaches, perfectly. In this paper introduce new 
multi-objective method for hiding sensitive association rules 
based on the concept of genetic algorithms. [6] The main 
purpose of this method is fully supporting security of database 
and keeping the utility and certainty of mined rules at highest 
level. 
“Aris Gkoulalas- Divanis, Member, IEEE, and Vassilios 
S.Verykios, Member , IEE” proposed a novel, exact border-
based approach that provides an optimal solution for the 
hiding of sensitive frequent item sets by 1) minimally 
extending the original database by a synthetically generated 
database part—the database extension, 2) formulating the 
creation of the database extension as a constraint satisfaction 
problem, 3) mapping the constraint satisfaction problem to an 
equivalent binary integer programming problem, 4)exploiting 
underutilized synthetic transactions to proportionally increase 
the support of nonsensitive item sets, 5) minimally relaxing 
the constraint satisfaction problem to provide an approximate 
solution close to the optimal one when an ideal solution does 
not exist, and 6) using a partitioning in the universe of the 
items to increase the efficiency of the proposed hiding 
algorithm. Extending the original database for sensitive item 
set hiding is proved to provide optimal solutions to an 
extended set of hiding problems compared to previous 
approaches and to provide solutions of higher quality.[2] 
Moreover, the application of binary integer programming 
enables the simultaneous hiding of the sensitive itemsets and 
thus allows for the identification of globally optimal solutions. 
 
III. ASSOCIATION RULE TECHNIQUES 
There are different types of algorithms in association rules 
namely: 
• A Priori algorithm 
• Partition algorithm 
• Pincher-search algorithm 
• Dynamic item set counting algorithm 
• FP-TREE growth algorithm. 
 
A. Apriori Algorithm  
Apriori algorithm is the most popular algorithm to find all 
the frequent sets. It makes use of the downward closure 
property. Apriori algorithm is a bottom-up search, moving 
upward level-wise in the lattice. Before   reading the database 
at every level it graciously prunes many of the sets which are 
unlikely to be frequent sets. 
The apriori frequent item set discovery algorithm uses the 
two functions namely (candidate generation and pruning) at 
every iteration. It moves upward in the lattice starting from 
level I till level k, where no candidate set remains after 
pruning.[10] 
 
B. Partition Algorithm 
The partition algorithm is based on the premise that the size 
of the global candidate set is considerably smaller than the set 
of all possible itemsets. As a result if we partition the set of 
transactions to smaller segments such that each segment can 
be accommodated in the main memory, then we can compute 
the set of frequent sets of each of these partitions. It is 
assumed that these sets contain reasonably a small number of 
itemsets.

C.  Pincer-Search Algorithm 
The pincher-search computation algorithm starts from the 
smallest set of frequent itemsets and moves upward till it 
reaches the largest frequent itemset. The pincher –search 
Algorithm is based on the principle of finding frequent item 
sets in a bottom-up manner but, at the same time, it maintains 
a list of maximal frequent item sets. 
D.   Dynamic Itemset Counting Algorithm 
The rationale of dynamic set counting algorithm is that it 
works like a train pruning over the data, with stops at intervals 
M between transactions. When the train reaches the end of 
transaction file, it has made one pass over the data, and it 
starts all over again from the beginning for the next pass. 
 
E.   FP-Tree Growth Algorithm 
The main idea of the algorithm is to maintain a Frequent 
Pattern Tree of the database. It is an extended prefix-tree 
structure, storing crucial and quantitative information about 
frequent sets. In this the tree nodes are the frequent items and 
are arranged in such a way that more frequently occurring 
nodes will have better chances of sharing nodes than the less 
frequently occurring ones. The method starts from frequent1- 
itemsets as an initial suffix pattern and examines only its 
conditional pattern base, which consists of the set of frequent 
items co-occurring with the suffix pattern. 
 
IV. INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES 
Interestingness measure produces different results, and 
experts have different opinions of what constitutes a good rule 
(Lenca, Meyer, Vaillant, & Lallich, 2008). The interestingness 
of discovered association rules is an important and active area 
within data mining research (Geng & Hamilton, 2006). The 
primary problem is the selection of interestingness measures 
for a given application domain. However, there is no formal 
agreement on a definition for what makes rules interesting. 
Association rule algorithms produce thousands of rules, many 
of which are redundant (Li & Zhang, 2003; McGarry, 2005). 
Two important measures within association rule mining are 
support and confidence. Support for an association rule          
X =>Y is the percentage of transactions in the database that 
contains X U Y. Confidence for an association rule 
(sometimes denoted as strength, or ?) X => Y is the ratio of 
the number of transactions that [1] contain to the number of 
transactions that contain X. (Dunham, 2003). In other words, 
support describes how often the rule would appear in the 
database, while confidence measures the strength of the rule. 
A user establishes minimum support (minsup) and minimum 
confidence (minconf). Rules are then generated based on 
those criteria. Users can select minsup and minconf 
parameters before or after rule generation. An example 
follows. Given a database of supermarket transaction data, a 
rule might be generated that infers milk eggs, with support = 
40% and confidence = 75%. This means that milk eggs 
occurred in 40% of the transactions in the database. It also 
means that 75% of the time that milk occurs, so do eggs. The 
antecedent for this rule is milk, while the consequent is eggs. 
Larger values of confidence and smaller values of support are 
normally selected when determining which association rules 
to keep. A third measure of interestingness is lift. Lift is a 
measure of the probability of finding the consequent in any 
random basket. In other words, lift “measures how well the 
associative rule performs by comparing its performance to the 
“null” rule” (Marakas, 2003, p. 342). 
An example of an association rule is as follows. 60% of 
customers that purchase potato chips also purchase soda in the 
same transaction. Agrawal et al.'s work established a formal 
model for association rules and establishes algorithms that 
find large itemsets, confidence, and support of each rule 
discovered in the itemset. Association rules have been applied 
to a wide variety of application areas, which will be covered 
later in this paper. Association rule algorithms can generate 
thousands of rules, many of which can be redundant. These 
redundant rules are essentially useless, so researchers have 
solved this problem by defining new interestingness measures, 
incorporating constraints, or by designing templates to mine 
for restricted rules (Xu & Li, 2007). Also, a primary goal of 
knowledge discovery in databases is to produce interesting 
rules that can be interpreted by a user (Lenca et al., 2008). 
 
 
V.  ASSOCIATION RULE HIDING 
 
Recent years have seen tremendous advances in the 
ability to perform association rule mining effectively. Such 
rules often encode important target marketing information 
about a business. Some of the earliest work on the challenges 
of association rule mining for database security. Two broad 
approaches are used for association rule hiding: 
Distortion: In distortion [9], the entry for a given transaction 
is modified to a different value. Since, we are typically 
dealing with binary transactional data sets, the entry value is 
flipped. 
Blocking: In blocking [8], the entry is not modified, but is left 
incomplete. Thus, unknown entry values are used to prevent 
discovery of association rules. 
We note that both the distortion and blocking processes 
have a number of side effects on the non-sensitive rules in the 
data. Some of the non-sensitive rules may be lost along with 
sensitive rules, and new ghost rules may be created because of 
the distortion or blocking process. Such side effects are 
undesirable since they reduce the utility of the data for mining 
purposes. A formal proof of the NP-hardness of the distortion 
method for hiding association rule mining. The techniques are 
proposed for changing some of the 1-values to 0-values so that 
the support of the corresponding sensitive rules is 
appropriately lowered. The utility of the approach was defined 
by the number of non-sensitive rules whose support was also 
lowered by using such an approach. This approach was 
extended in which both support and confidence of the 
appropriate rules could be lowered. In this case, 0-values in 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Communication and Computational Intelligence – 2010 
103 
 
the transactional database could also change to 1-values. In 
many cases, this resulted in spurious association rules (or a 
ghost rule) which was an undesirable side effect of the 
process. A complete description of the various methods for 
data distortion for association rule hiding. Another interesting 
piece of work which balances privacy and disclosure concerns 
of sanitized rules may be found in [8]. 
The attractiveness of the blocking approach is that it 
maintains the truthfulness of the underlying data, since it 
replaces a value with an unknown (often represented by ‘?’) 
rather than a false value. Some interesting algorithms for 
using blocking for association rule hiding. The work has been 
further extended in [11] with a discussion of the effectiveness 
of reconstructing the hidden rules. Another interesting set of 
techniques for association rule hiding with limited side 
effects. The objective of this method is to reduce the loss of 
non-sensitive rules, or the creation of ghost rules during the 
rule hiding process .It has been discussed how blocking 
techniques for hiding association rules can be used to prevent 
discovery of sensitive entries in the data set by an adversary. 
In this case, certain entries in the data are classified as 
sensitive, and only rules which disclose such entries are 
hidden. An efficient depth-first association mining algorithm 
is proposed for this task [8]. It has been shown that the 
methods can effectively reduce the disclosure of sensitive 
entries with the use of such a hiding process. 
 
VI. ANALYSIS OF PAPER 
Data mining can extract important knowledge from 
large data collection. Association rule mining is a category of 
data mining tasks that correlate a set of items with other sets 
of items in a database. The main purpose of this method is 
fully supporting security of database and keeping the utility 
and certainty of mined rules at highest level. In recent years, 
advances in hardware technology have lead to an increase in 
the capability to store and record personal data about 
consumers and individuals. This has lead to concerns that the 
personal data may be misused for a variety of purposes. In this 
paper various communities such as the database community, 
the statistical disclosure control community and the 
cryptography community techniques are discussed. Now a 
day’s Privacy preserving data mining has becoming an 
important factor in association rule mining which has been 
used in various fields for its efficiency and security. 
 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
Privacy becomes an important factor in data mining so that 
the sensitive information is not revealed after mining. But the 
data quality is important such that no false information is 
provided and the privacy is not jeopardized. Association rule 
is one category of data mining technique. Other data mining 
techniques should also be considered for securing both data 
and knowledge. In future we will give privacy preserving data 
mining based on association rule using Tabu search 
optimization technique.
