Abstract—This paper presents results for the economical analysis 
of efficient monophase transformers when used instead of 
standard transformers made at the High Voltage Laboratory if 
Federal University of Itajubá (LAT-EFEI). The analysis was 
made using capitalization rules based into two wages cycles, as 
recommended by Brazilian Electrical Energy Agency - ANEEL. 
In addition, it is also discussed, briefly, a comparison made with 
the traditional method using the present value of transformer 
losses costs. Finally, authors propose a methodology to study the 
application of efficient transformers to replace the ones 
standardized by Brazilian normative association, ABNT. 
Keywords-loading; Economical viability analysis, payback,

I. INTRODUCTION 
Distribution transformers are equipments that present a 
high performance, about 99%. Although, when used in 
electrical networks, considering different voltage levels, the 
total amount of losses can be considerably high. 
When an efficiency increase is desired, it is necessary to 
decrease the load and no load losses. Therefore, increasing the 
efficiency depends on the dimensions, quality and quantity of 
materials used for the transformer’s core and windings and no 
additional technological innovation is necessary.  
No load losses are related to the core project. If silicon 
steel is used, the core must present larger dimensions, so that 
the magnetic flow can be reduced. Load losses are related to 
the windings design so that, when the conductors section is 
increased the current density is decreased, reducing the load 
losses. 
In general, transformers must be designed according to 
losses levels established in technical standards. Actually, there 
is no common definition about high efficiency transformers. 
Each standard and each country define their own limits taking 
into account losses, costs or the production of transformers 
over a certain period. 
An economical viability study for a transformer design 
indicates is the design is feasible or not, considering its costs. 
This paper presents a study based on data supplied by AES 
Sul, a Brazilian power distribution company, using the rules 
imposed by Brazilian Electrical Energy Agency – ANEEL for 
investment analysis. 
Previous studies [1] using the PHOPHET Method indicate 
that this kind of studies may result in feasible projects with a 
payback time smaller than 5 years. 
II. INVESTIMENT CALCULATION 
Using ANEEL rules, the payback for the investment in 
transformers, for tariffs adjustment, are calculated using five 
years cycles. For AES Sul, the last cycle for tariff adjustment 
begun in 2008. According to ANEEL’s methodology, the 
profits with losses reduction by the replacement of equipments 
are calculated only in the period for the first cycle after the 
tariffs adjustment and do not depend on the year the 
investment was made. As a consequence, the capitalization 
period range from five to zero years. After finishing the first 
period, the investment is calculated according to the return on 
assets. The economical analysis presented in this paper 
includes a period of 10 years. 
A. Profits for the First Period of Tariff Adjustment 
According to ANEEL regulation, the profits for the first 
period of tariff adjustment are due to the losses reduction 
obtained with the replacement of standard transformers by 
efficient ones.  
At first place, it is necessary to consider the investment 
with the transformers replacement, represented by TRC? - 
Costs Difference between standard and efficient transformers. 
This difference is remunerated by costs of load and no load 
losses during the analysis time. Costs for maintenance and 
installation are not considered in this study. 
Costs for no load and load losses, based on the rated losses 
of transformers, are calculated by expressions in (1) and (2), 
values using Brazilian currency (R$): 
 NWOWO W.TC =  (1)

where TW0 is the tax for no load losses, R$/kW; TWL is the tax 
for load losses, R$/kW; WN is the no load losses, W; and WL 
is the load losses, W. 
For the taxes: 
 EEWO C.76,8T =  (3)

where CEE is the Electrical energy cost, R$/kWh; and FE is the 
Consumed energy factor, Hours/Day. 
The FE (Consumed Energy Factor) or TSMP (Time 
Supplying Maximum Power) defined by (5), indicates the total 
time, in one day, for which the transformer, working at full 
load, needs to present the series losses for a daily average duty 
cycle.

The profits obtained with the losses - ?CE due to the 
replacement of standard equipments, for the first cycle, as 
shown in (6), is constant for all the years that compose the 
cycle. Considering that the unities are acquired in a year “t” 
(before the next tariff adjustment - TRT) the profits with the 
first adjustment comprise the years between “t - TRT”. For 
AES Sul, the TRT, year for the next tariff adjustment, is 2013.

B. Profits for the Period Following the Tariff’s Adjustment 
According to ANEEL regulation, capital profits during 2nd 
and 3rd periods of tariff’s adjustment are due to the return on 
assets, considering cumulated inflation and depreciation in the 
period. The depreciation for a transformer is of 4% per year, 
considering a 25 years lifetime. 
The depreciation for the difference of assets (costs 
difference between standard and efficient transformers) after 
the first and following periods for tariff’s adjustment – ?CTRDK 
is calculated by equation (9).

WACC for the corresponding period, according to (11).

III. ECONOMICAL ANALYSIS 
This economical analysis was developed based on the data

some values come from the respective standards and the 
transformers depreciation is of 4% per year.

A.  Sensibility Analysis – year 2009 
In order to evaluate the sensibility of the achieved results, 
some studies were conducted considering variations in FE, 
difference of costs between efficient and standard transformers 
and investment date, using 2009 as basis year. Results are 
shown in Table 2. 
It can be seen, in Table 2, that a positive cash flow can be 
obtained, with a payback time of 10 years, if a high value of 
FE and a small costs difference is used. It is also possible to 
see that, for a fixed payback time, decreases in the FE result in 
reduction in the manufacturing costs.

Table 3 shows some aspects related to “the best year to 
initiate the investments” in efficient transformers. Payback 
and analysis time were considered constant and equal do 10 
years. Present values are referred to year 2009 and the FE is 
also constant and equal do 12. It means that load losses during 
a daily cycle match with the operation of transformers using 
rated power during half a day.

Considering investment values and energy factor – FE 
presented, independently of the year for the beginning of 
investment, the projects are economically feasible as the 
present values are always negative. Analyzing data in Table 3, 
there is no straight relation linking the year for the beginning 
of investment and present value. Anyway, in cases where the 
investment is considered high, there is a tendency to reduce 
economical losses (increase in profits) as the time for the 
beginning of investment is closer to the end of the tariff’s 
adjustment cycle, implying in a larger weight for the return on 
assets. On the other hand, if the cases with a small investment 
are considered, there is a tendency to reduce economical 
losses as the beginning of investment is close to the beginning 
of tariff’s adjustment cycle, implying in a larger weight for the 
present value of losses costs, assumed as constant. 
Figure 2 depicts this tendency for several investment 
difference values, FE equal to 12 and losses and energy costs 
according to Table 1. For each economical data and losses set 
there is a difference between transformers costs that updates 
the present value to a fixed value. For this example, this costs 
difference is equal to R$ 900.00. Smaller values indicate that 
it is more opportune to invest in the beginning of the first 
cycle of tariff’s adjustment. On the other hand, larger values 
make it more appropriate to invest in the end of the first cycle 
of adjustment. From the exposed data, it is possible to verify 
that only differences in transformers costs below R$ 200.00 
result in positive present values. 
 
Figure 2.  Present Value versus Investment Year – FE = 12. 
Figure 3 depicts the influence of the reduction of spent 
energy factor. According to this figure, reductions in energy 
factor imply in modifications for the characteristics “Present 
Value x Investment Year”.  It is possible to notice a 
displacement, with no tendency, of the transformers’ costs 
difference bringing the present value to a constant cost. 
Taking technical limitations of this study into account, for FE 
= 3, it is possible to notice a tendency to define a cost 
difference between standard and efficient transformers about 
R$ 100.00 to R$ 150.00. 
 
Figure 3.  Present value versus Investment Year – FE = 3. 
Table 4 presents variations for the investment year and 
transformers’ cost difference so that it is possible to find an 
energy factor to make the cash flow equal to zero. This is 
important information, as it is related with the minimum load 
to make the efficient transformer project become feasible, 
according to adopted technical and economical limitations.

Figure 4.  Present Value versus Investment Year – FE = 3 – Losses Costs. 
Comparing information from figures 3 and 4, it is possible 
to conclude that for high differences in costs, ANEEL’s 
capitalization method presents outstanding advantages. In 
these cases, as an example, for FE = 3, basis year and 
investment year 2009, costs differences equal to R$ 1,200.00, 
and an analysis time of 10 years, ANEEL’s method presents a 
present value of R$ - 607.39, against R$ - 900.59. On the 
other hand, considering a cost difference of only R$ 200.00, 
ANEEL’s method presents a present value of R$ 21.51 against 
R$ 99.41. For high investment costs (see figures 2 and 3), the 
assets amortization is predominant. In cases where the 
investment costs are small, the present value of losses costs is 
predominant for the return on assets. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The results presented in this paper reproduce distinctive 
conditions of winding and core losses in transformers obtained 
from manufacturers. A reduction of these losses was 
considered to calculate hypothetical costs to be paid, as though 
as its reflections on the investment payback. In the used 
examples, a difference for the core losses of about 30 W 
(reduction of 13.6%) and winding losses of 130 W (reduction 
of 16.7%) presents a difference for the investment costs in the 
range of R$ 100.00 to R$ 1,500.00. Some technical aspects 
were not taken into account, as the hypothesis that larger costs 
differences must result in smaller losses. 
As noticed in table 2, considering the limits indicated 
above, large differences for the investment costs request large 
spent energy factors, above 12 hours a day in full load. On the 
other hand, small energy factors, around 3 hours a day in full 
load, implies in the necessity of smaller costs differences, 
around R$ 200.00 (Figure 4). 
It is not possible to indicate directly which the best 
methodology for investment payback is. It seems that, for each 
pattern of losses reduction, there is an investment that results 
approximately in the same present value, considering the same 
period of analysis. This value depicts boundaries between the 
regions where the return on assets or the present value of 
losses costs are predominant. Consequently, considering the 
possibility of small investments, considering energy factors 
below 5 hours per day at full load, it is possible to deal with 
maximum investment differences in the order of R$ 400.00. 
Finally, the usage of efficient transformers needs to 
consider the models for investment payback, losses profits and 
assets amortization, as proposed by ANEEL, so that it can 
become economically feasible. The variables that take part in 
this process present strong correlations and each case must be 
studied in particular. Calculation procedures must take into 
account load measurements, as indicated by the consumed 
energy factor (FE), which is related to the transformer thermal 
model and its time constants. To make the whole process 
reasonable, i.e., smaller costs to result in larger profits with 
losses reduction, the model for investment payback according 
to present value of losses costs must be considered. After the 
attainment of the most appropriate losses configuration and 
presentation of the final transformer project to manufacturers, 
the values for losses and costs must be reassessed   according 
to ANEEL’s proposal for return on assets.
