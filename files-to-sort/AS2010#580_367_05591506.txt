Abstract—It has been widely accepted that association rules 
mining, the task of searching for correlations between items in a 
database, can discover useful rules in stock analysis. Previous 
studies mainly emphasize on mining intratransaction associations. 
In this paper, we introduce the concept of intertransaction and 
the FITI algorithm so that we can effectively forecast the price 
changes in Chinese capital markets, then we compare FITI with 
EH-Apriori, and demonstrate the advantages of FITI over EH-
Apriori. At the end of this paper, we apply the algorithm to a 
dataset of Chinese asset indices and the results indicate the 
usefulness of intertransaction association rules in price prediction.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Data mining is widely used in various academic fields 
such as forecasting stock market or bank bankruptcies, 
financial risk management, credit rating, bank customer 
profiling and cross-selling analysis. One important problem in 
data mining is mining association rules, which was introduced 
by Agrawal [1]. Given two item sets X and Y, an association 
rule means X?Y. 
Association rules mining can be used in market analysis, 
fraud detection, medical research and process re-engineering 
[2]. The most often cited work on market analysis is mining 
interesting rules from supermarkets transaction database. Each 
transaction contains the items bought by one of its customer. 
An example of the rule is “70% of customers who bought milk 
also bought bread” which can be expressed:  
R1: milk? bread. (support: 60%, confidence 80%). 
Association rules mining of large databases gives rise to 
many research directions, including Apriori-like mining 
methods [3][4]); quantitative association rules mining[4]; 
constraint-based rules mining [5]; mining association rules 
with multiple supports [6]; constraint-based rule mining [7]; 
mining sequential patterns and episodes[4][9].  
In spite of all these efforts, there is a kind of association 
relationships of great importance and usefulness that could not 
be expressed using the traditional association rule mining 
framework---intertransaction association rule mining. This 
problem was first explored by Anthony [10], which introduced 
the notion of intertransaction association rule, defined its own 
measures support and confidence and developed an efficient 
Apriori-like algorithm---FITI algorithm. This algorithm 
decomposes intertransaction association rule mining problem 
into three subproblems. First, one finds and stores frequent 
intratransaction item sets; and then, he/she transforms the 
database into a set of encoded Frequent-Itemset Tables (Called 
FIT tables); finally, he/she can find frequent intertransaction 
item sets.  
The difference between the traditional association rule and 
intertransaction association rule can be depicted as the 
following: 
R2: ‘‘When the prices of TCL and Changhong go up, the 
price of Hisense will increase on the same day with 
probability of 80%.’’ 
However, stockjobbers may be more interested in the 
following rule. 
R3: ‘‘If the prices of TCL and Changhong go up on the 
first day, the price of Hisense will increase two days later 
probability of 80%.’’ 
Classical association rules, like R2, discover the 
relationship among items within the same transactions, while 
R3 expresses association among items of different transactions 
along certain dimension. Relevant studies include sequential 
patterns mining [5] and mining episodes [9].  
In this paper, we will investigate the application of 
intertransaction association rules mining in stock price 
predication and the possibility of generalizing this method to 
futures market.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2 we explain the definitions of intertransaction and 
describe the intertransaction association rule mining task; in 
Section 3, we present the framework of intertransaction 
association rule mining method and express the main idea of 
FITI algorithm, then briefly review the FITI algorithm and 
show the advantage of it over traditional algorithms. Real 
datasets are investigated in Section 4, where we discuss the 
generalization and application of this method to Chinese 
capital market. We summarize our work in Section 5. 
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS 
Definition 1. Let 1 2{ , , , }ue e e6    denote a set of 
items, where u is the number of transactions, and denote D a 
set of non-negative integers called domain attributes. A

transaction database is a set of transactions 1 2{ ,  ,  ,  }nT T T , 
where Ti (i= 1, 2,…, n ) is a subset of 6 . A transaction is in 
the form of <d, E>, where ( )d Dom D?  and E ? 6 . d is 
named a dimensional attribute and E is named an itemset. 
The dimensional attribute describes the properties 
associated with the data items, such as time and location. We 
assume that the domain of the dimensional attribute is ordinal 
and can be divided into equal length intervals. For example, 
time can be divided into hours, days, weeks, etc. The intervals 
can be represented by integers. 
Definition 2. A sliding window W in a transaction 
database *  is a block of w continuous intervals along domain 
D, starting from interval d0 such that *  contains a transaction 
at interval d0. Each interval dj in W is called a subwindow of 
W and denoted as W[j], where j= dj -d0. We call j the 
subwindow number of dj within W. 
The concept of sliding window is introduced to describe 
how many intervals an intertransaction association rule spans 
across. In order to save resources and mine more economically, 
the parameter maxspan ( w ) is introduced to express the size 
of the sliding window.  
Definition 3. A megatransaction M is defined as 
{ ( ) | ( )  [ ],   1 ,   0 1}i iM e j e j W j i u j w ? d d d d         (1)    
Items in one megatransaction are defined as extended-items 
and denote the set of all extended-items as 
1 1 2 2{ (0), , ( -1), (0), , ( -1), , (0),... , ( -1) }.  u ue e w e e w e e wc6     (2)                       
We define the set of items 1 I ?6  as intratransaction itemset 
and the set of items 2I c?6  as intertransaction itemset. 
Definition 4. An intertransaction association rule is 
written in the form of X Y? , where ,X Yc c? 6 ? 6  and 
X Y  ? . 
Definition 5. X and Y are both extended itemsets subject to 
Definition 4. We define the support and confidence of an 
intertransaction association rule X Y?  as  
  ^ `| |  and |Support

Above definitions can be explained by an example. Table 
1 shows a transaction database containing five transactions. 
The five transactions are located at intervals 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Let 
w=4, we now have five sliding windows W1 , W2 , W3 , W4  and 
W5, with addresses of 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, respectively. Each window 
contains 4 subwindows. For example, W1 has four subwindows 
W1 [0] (with items a, b), W1 [1] (with items b, d), W1 [2] and 
W1 [3] (with items a, b, c, d).  
Each sliding window forms a megatransaction, which is 
the itemset of all the items in one sliding window. In our case, 
the megatransaction in W1  is {a[0], b[0], b[1], d[1], 
a[3],b[3],c[3],d[3]}. Thus, we have c6 ={ a1[0], b1[0], b1[1], 
d1[1], a1[3], b1[3], c1[3], d1[3], b2[0], d2[0], a2[2], b2[2], c2[2], 
d2[2], b2[3], c2 [3], a3[0], b3[0], c3[0], d3[0], b3[1], c3[1], a3[2], 
b4[0], c4[0], a4[1], a5[0]}. 
Then, after we set the two essential parameters minsup 
(denotes minimum support level) and minconf (denotes 
minimum confidence level), we can mine intertransaction 
association rules from the transaction database. For instance, 
setting minsup=0.4 and minconf=0.8, we can get one rule 
mined from Table 1, {b[0], d[0]} ? a[2] (support=0.4, 
confidence=1).

III. 0INING INTERTRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES 
In this section, we give an overview of intertransaction 
association rules mining. Like the traditional association rule 
mining, the novel one consists of two steps: 
(1)  Find frequent intertransaction itemsets whose support 
is higher than minsup. 
(2) For every frequent intertransaction itemset L, output 
an intertransaction association rule ,S L S?   if the 
following conditions are satisfied: 
i.  ( ) ,  1 ,ie j S i u? d d   
ii.  ( ) ,   1 ,   0,ie j L S i u j?  d d z   
iii. Confidence of S L S?   is higher than minconf. 
According to Anthony [10], first intratransaction then 
intertransaction (FITI), consists of three steps: 
(1) Mining and Storing frequent intratransaction itemsets; 
(2) Transforming the database into a set of encoded 
Frequent-Itemset Tables (Called FIT tables); 
(3) Mining frequent intertransaction itemsets.  
The outline of algorithms is as follows. 
ALGORITHM I  DATABASE TRANSFORMATION ALGORITHM. 
Void Transform () { 
while (!feof (T)) { 
read next transaction Ti; 
write di to all Fj; 
Subset (Ti, 1, 1, 0) }} 
void Subset (Ti, index, k, and NodeID) { 
if (k= =1) { 
1423
for each item ej in Ti { 
Search Itemtable for ID of {ej} 
If (found) { 
Let nowID be ID found; 
Write nowID to F1; 
For each item em (m>j) in Ti { 
Search childs of nowID for an itemset I that 
Contains em; 
If (found) { 
Let nextNode be the ID of I; 
Subset (Ti, m+1, k+1, nextNode); }}}} 
Return;} 
else { 
Write NodeID to Fk; 
For each item em (m>= index) in Ti { 
Search childs of NodeID for an itemset I that 
Contains em; 
If (found) { 
Let nextNode be the ID of I; 
Subset (Ti, m+1, k+1, nextNode); }} 
Return ;}} 
 
ALGORITHM II LEVEL-WISE MINING OF FREQUENT 
INTERTRANSACTION ITEMSETS. 
Input: A set of FIT tables: F1,…, Fmax, and the minimum 
support threshold: minsup. 
Output: The complete set of frequent intertransaction 
itemsets  
Generate frequent intertransaction 2-itemsets, L2; 
k=3; 
While (Lk-1 )z ) { 
Generate candidate intertransaction k-itemsets, Ck; 
Scan transformed database to update the count for Ck; 
Let Lk = { kCc? support(c)tminsup}; 
k++;} 
 
ALGORITHM III GENERATION OF ALL THE (K-ITEMSET) SUBSETS OF 
AN INTERTRANSACTION (K+1)-ITEMSET. 
Let S be the set of k-subsets of I; 
S= {}; 
for (p=0; p < w; p++) { 
if (Ip! = 0) { 
If (Ip is an intratransaction one-itemsets) { 
If (p!=0) 
Add {I0,…, Ip-1, 0,…, Iw-1} to S 
Else 
Add {I0,…, Iw-1,0} to S 
} else 
{Let Ip be an intratransaction h-itemsets, h > 1 
For each (h-1)-subset of Ip 
{Let t be the ID of the (h-1)-subset 
add {I0,…, Ip-1, t,…, Iw-1} to S}}}} 
Return S; 
 
Then we compare the FITI algorithm with EH-Apriori as 
the way it is made in Anthony [10]. We adjust the value of 
maxspan, minsup, minconf and the size of transaction of 
synthetic data, respectively. The result shows that although 
FITI requires larger computer memory space than EH-Apriori, 
it outperforms the traditional algorithm, since FITI could save 
considerable running time. 
IV. $PPLICATIONS IN CHINESE REAL FINANCIAL DATA 
In this section, we apply the FITI algorithm to various 
financial datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of 
intertransaction association rules in price prediction. All the 
dataVHWV DUH obtained from the Wind Database. 
(http://www.wind.com.cn/). 
A. Dataset of Chinese capital market 
We first consider the dataset of Chinese treasury bond 
(T-bond) daily price index traded in Shanghai Stock 
Exchange (TB), Shanghai Composite Index (CI) daily price, 
daily exchange rate of Euro against RMB (ER) and US 
dollar against RMB (UR) traded in the inter-bank foreign 
exchange market from January 23, 2007 to June 23, 2007.  
We use these data for several reasons. First, the capital 
market comprises of foreign exchange market, stock market, 
bonds and loan market. Most existing studies investigate 
the relation between stock market and bond market. Here 
we apply our method to the capital market and try to find 
intertransaction association rules from them.  
We separate the dataset into two portions: one is UP, 
and the other is DOWN. The UP consists of the stock 
indices, bond indices and exchange rates that rise on the 
experiment day, and the latter group contains their decrease 
counterparts.  
We set maxspan = 5 so that we could detect the 
association rules happening within five days. The results 
are quite interesting. One rule of the UP part is “ER (1), TB 
(2)?CI (4)” with support=0.19 and confidence=0.86. This 
means that if Euro against RMB rises on the first day 
followed by the increase of Chinese Treasury bond on the 
second day, then the possibility that Shanghai Composite 
Index rises on the fourth day is 86%. For the Down part, a 
rule is “CI (1), ER (3)?TB (5)” with support = 0.10 and 
confidence = 0.81, which indicates that if Shanghai 
Composite Index decreases on the first day and the 
exchange rate of Euro against RMB decreases on the third 
day , the possibility that the Chinese treasury bond index 
decreases is 81%. With these rules, one speculator can buy 
the stock index when the events in the first rule happen, and 
sell the bond when the events in the second rule happen. 
From this example we can see the usefulness of 
intertransaction association rule mining in finding rules and 
stock price prediction.  
B. Dataset of stock indices 
The second dataset consists of Shanghai Composite 
Index (SCI)? Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI)?
Taiwan Weighted Stock Index (WTI) for 129 trading days 
from January 1, 2007 to June 29, 2007. Like the above 
1424
method, the data is first separated into two groups. From 
the UP group, one interesting rule we find is “HSI (1), TWI 
(2) ? SCI (5)” with support=0.26 and confidence=0.81, 
which means that if the HIS and TWI increase on the first 
and second day, respectively, the possibility that the SCI 
increases on the fifth day is 81%. 
This rule among the three indices may reveal a potential 
effect of the stock markets of Hong Kong and Taiwan on 
the stock market of China mainland. Such unaware 
relationship can be discovered using the intertransaction 
mining method introduced. 
C. Dataset of futures market 
The third dataset considers SHFE and LME copper (Cu) 
futures, NYMEX crude oil (CL) futures, exchange rate of 
US dollar against RMB and the exchange rate of Euro 
against US dollar for 334 trading days from July 3, 2006 to 
June 1, 2007.  
We use futures market data for several reasons. 
According to Chan et al. [11], Jiang and Zhou [12] and 
Andersen et al. [13], there may be certain relations among 
the LME Cu, SHFE Cu, NYMEX CL and foreign exchange 
rate. The mining result shows that there is a certain relation 
among SHFE Cu, LEM Cu, and NYMEX HL. Let 
maxspan=4, one of the rules is “SHFE Cu (1), LEM Cu (3) 
? NYMEX HL (3)” with support=0.11 and 
confidence=0.79. But we can't find any relation among 
them and foreign exchange rate. 
V. &ONCLUSIONS AND POSSIBLE FUTURE WORK 
 There is no doubt that traditional association rule 
mining is a useful method for price prediction. However, 
the classical method is limited within individual transaction. 
In this paper, we demonstrate that the mysterious 
association rules among different transactions could be 
mined by the intertransaction association rule mining and 
FITI algorithm, and apply the intertransaction association 
rule mining method into Chinese financial market trend 
prediction. From our dataset analysis, we find the 
effectiveness of intertransaction association rule mining in 
mining rules among different economic indicators.  
In the future, we will extend our study further to mine 
more advisable and interesting rules that could explain 
Chinese financial market better.
