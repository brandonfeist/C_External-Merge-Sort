I.  INTRODUCTION 
Data Mining is the process of finding hidden patterns in a 
large data set. It can be defined   as the nontrivial extraction of 
implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful 
information from data .spatial data mining can be defined as a 
set of exploratory computational and statistical approaches for 
analyzing very large spatial and spatiotemporal data sets.  
Data mining techniques are often grouped into categories that 
include clustering, categorization, summarization, rule-
mining, and feature extraction[1].  All of these types of 
techniques are generally oriented towards identifying spatial 
or spatio-temporal patterns in geographic observations or 
measurements. Challenges in spatial data mining arises 
because traditional data mining deals with continues and 
discrete variables whereas spatial data is more complex and 
rich comprising of objects like points, lines and polygons. 
Spatial Data Mining comprises of spatial attributes like 
distance, spatial autocorrelation and spatial predicates like 
overlap that are quite implicit as compared to tradition data 
mining where inputs are explicit [2]. 
Several methods has been developed to discover spatial 
association rules. These are statistical analysis, generalization 
techniques, extension of techniques from mining association 
rules based on market basket transaction data and collocation 
rules discovery techniques. Statistical techniques handles 
numerical data very well and there is rich set of algorithms 
developed using these techniques [3]. But they usually assume 
statistical independence of spatial data which proves to be 
unrealistic due to influence of neighboring regions. These 
techniques heavily depend on domain and statistical 
knowledge [4]. Generalization techniques employ high level 
concepts. These concepts describe general relation ships 
between spatial and non-spatial data.  
Extension of techniques for mining association rules in 
transaction-based databases to mining spatial association rules 
is another solution. A transaction is artificially created in some 
of these techniques so support, confidence, pruning from 
transaction-based algorithm can be applied to spatial 
databases. 
As mentioned in previous section Statistical algorithms to 
discover spatial association rules is one of the methods. These 
methods heavily depend on numerical data and they make 
unrealistic assumption in case of spatial data [5]. Influence of 
neighboring regions is an example where it becomes very 
challenging for these methods. These methods also deals very 
poorly with symbolic names like Expensive(condo) <-> 
inside(condo, downtown)^area(condo,large).  
Generalization techniques use high level concepts. These 
algorithms are used for non-spatial dominant generalization 
and spatial-dominant generalization. These methods can not 
deal with the rules reflecting structure of spatial objects and 
relationships which contain spatial predicates such as 
adjacent_to, inside, close_to etc [6].  
Moreover, spatial data has a strong auto correlation 
wherein different spatial variables are correlated with other 
whereas traditional data mining focuses on independence of 
variables.  
A concept lattice is generated automatically from a 
relation between two sets, objects and attributes The concept 
(or Galois) Lattice of a binary relation formalizes it as a 
concept system, dually ordered in "extension" / "intension". 
All implications between conjunctions of properties holding in 
it are summarized by a canonical basis - all basis having the 
same cardinality [7]. Using these tools lattices have been used 
to analyze binary data since the early eighties. Some 
procedures address more the former direction (lattice drawing, 
gluing decomposition, sub-lattices...) while others the latter 
(canonical basis of implications and lattice's core, box 
decomposition, weighted lattices). 
This paper proposes an algorithm about spatial association 
rule mining which is based on concept lattice. Then, 
conception lattice is used in mining spatial association rules by 
the way that used in attribute association rules. Hence, the 
978-1-4244-4639-1/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE
method of mining spatial association rules is reduced to the 
method of mining attribute association rules. 
II. DEFINITION OF SPATIAL CONCEPT LATTICE 
Concept lattice, which is also named as Galois lattice, is a 
relatively new approach to the mathematics normalization and 
representation of conceptual knowledge. A concept lattice (a 
concept hierarchy) can be represented graphically using line 
(or Hasse) diagrams. These structures are composed of nodes 
and links. Each node represents a concept with its associated 
intensional description. The links connecting nodes represent 
the sub-concept and super-concept relation among them. This 
relation indicates that the parent’s extension is a superset of 
each child’s intension. A node covers all of the instances 
covered by the union of its descendents, making the concept 
hierarchy a sub-graph of the partial ordering by generality. 
More abstract or general nodes occur higher in the hierarchy, 
whereas more specific ones occur at lower levels [8]. Object 
concepts are named with the specific object that produces the 
concept while attribute concepts are labeled with the specific 
attribute that generates the concept. A diagram contains all the 
context information; an object has an attribute if and only if 
there is an upwards leading path from its object concept to this 
attribute concept (Figure 1 shows the diagram for the attribute 
concept).

First, we give some standard definitions of formal concept 
analysis and some new definitions: 
Definition 1: The formal context is a triple ( , , )T O D R= , 
where O is a set of objects, D is a set of their attributes, and R 
is the binary relation between O and D. according to the 
inclusion relationships between extensions, there is a unique 
lattice structure lattice L, which defines natural groupings and  
relationships descriptions between the objects and their 
attributes in the context.  . 
Corresponding, besides the set of descriptors (attributes), 
definition of spatial concept lattice is the same as that of 
concept lattice which is proposed by Wille. The set of 
descriptors (attributes) is defined as the set of spatial relations 
and other spatial attributes of objects in spatial concept lattice. 
Spatial concept satisfies properties described as follow [9]:  
Each node of lattice L is a pair ( , )A B   as concept, A 
pair ( , )A B  is called an object oriented concept, Sets A, B are 
called the intension and extension of formal concept ( , )Y X    
respectively. 
Definition 2: For a set A O?  of objects and a set B P? of 
properties we define: 
The set of properties common to the objects in A: 
  { }A p P oRp for all A= ? |    ??                             (1) 
The set of objects which have all properties in B: 
{ }B o O oRp for all p B= ? |    ?                               (2) 
The couple of operators ( , )  is a Galois Connection. 
The set of all concepts of a context ( , , )O D R together with 
the order relation  is always a complete lattice, called the 
concept lattice of ( ( , , )T O D R=  and denoted 
by ( , , )B O D R . The lattice structure imposes a partial order 
on concepts and any concept subset must have one greatest 
common sub-concept and one smallest common super-
concept. 
III. GENERALIZATION OF SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP 
A spatial association rule indicates certain relationship among 
a set of spatial and possibly non-spatial predicates. It describes 
the implication of one or a set of features in spatial databases. 
Extension techniques for mining association rules in 
transaction-based databases is used for spatial association rule 
mining. A spatial association rule is in the form of “X->Y” 
where X and Y are set of predicates and some of which are 
spatial ones. The predicates involved in spatial association 
rules may represent topological relationships between spatial 
objects such as disjoint, intersects, inside/outside, adjacent to, 
cover/covered by equal etc [10]. They may also be in form of 
spatial orientation or ordering such as left, right, north, east 
etc. They may contain some distance information such as 
close to, faraway etc. Many spatial association rules are 
expressed at a relatively high concept level. Support and 
confidence concepts from traditional data mining are applied 
to discover spatial association rules. Support indicates the 
probability of a patterns occurrence in set of spatial objects. 
Confidence X->Y is the occurring probability of Y whenever 
X occurs. Minimum support and minimum confidence 
threshold levels are used to eliminate the patterns that are not 
supposed to be interesting. This also reduces the number of the 
candidates and speeds up pattern discovery process. A concept 
hierarchy defines a sequence of mappings from a set of low-level 
concepts to higher-level, more general concepts. Consider a 
concept hierarchy for the dimension location. City values for 
Figure 1 the diagram for the attribute concept 
 
location include some cities. Each city, however, can be mapped 
to the province or state to which it belongs. For example, 
Wuhan can be mapped to Hubei, and Changsha to Hunan. The 
provinces and states can in turn be mapped to the country to 
which they belong, such as China or the USA. These 
mappings form a concept hierarchy for the dimension location, 
mapping a set of low-level concepts (i.e., cities) to higher-level, 
more general concepts (i.e., countries). The concept hierarchy 
described above is illustrated in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Many concept hierarchies are implicit within the database 
schema. For example, suppose that the dimension location is 
described by the attributes number, street, city, province or 
state, zip-code, and country. These attributes are related by a 
total order, forming a concept hierarchy such as "street < city < 
province or state < country". Alternatively, the attributes of a 
dimension may be organized in a partial order, forming a 
lattice. An example of a partial order for the time dimension 
based on the attributes day, week, month, quarter, and year is 
"day < {month <quarter; week} < year".2 A concept hierarchy 
that is a total or partial order among attributes in a database 
schema is called a schema hierarchy. Concept hierarchies that 
are common to many applications may be predefined in the 
data mining system, such as the concept hierarchy for time. 
Data mining systems should provide users with the flexibility 
to tailor predefined hierarchies according to their particular 
needs. For example, users may like to define a fiscal year 
starting on April 1, or an academic year starting on September 
1. 
Based on attribute values and distances, we will identify 
the data mining context this can be identified with a concept 
hierarchy, or in our model a “partition hierarchy”.  Concept 
hierarchies are commonly defined as a tree of mappings from a 
set of low-level concepts to more general concepts, such as 
"city" < "province or state" < "country". This section begins by 
introducing two constructs that are fundamental to the 
framework subsequently developed. Assume we are given a 
spatial dataset providing information about some geospatial 
phenomenon and structured according to a prescribed 
representation. This representation will possess both extent and 
granularity. 
IV. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM BASED ON 
SPATIAL CONCEPT LATTICE 
Association Rule Mining aims at finding rules on the basis of 
their relevance.. Its basic idea is to create all rules of each 
node without redundancy and its primary gist is the number 
and form of the parent node. When the graph has set of spatial 
concept lattice is given, the spatial association rule mining 
algorithm can be divided into two steps: the first step is to 
acquire parent nodes of all lattice nodes; the second one is to 
create association rule using theorem 1~3. 
Theorem1. If node '( , )H X X=  in the lattice has only one 
parent node '( , )M Y Y=  , then any rules’ foreside created 
from H could only be a single descriptor, and for 
' '( )p X Y=  ?  there exists a rule '( )p X p=>  ?  without 
redundancy. 
Proof: Suppose a rule created from node H is: 
 
'
1 2 1 2... ...n np p p X p p p=>  ?  
1n >   and ' , 1, 2,...,ip Y i n?  =   Then for x Y? ? , the 
rule '1 2 1 2... ...n np p p X p p p=>  ?  comes into existence. 
So this rule should be created from parent node M. 
If there is a descriptor ' '{ }, {1,2,....., }kp X Y k n?  ? ?  
in 1 2... np p p  , 
Then rule '1 2 1 2... ...n np p p X p p p=>  ?  is redundant 
relative to rule ' 'kp X Y?  ?  
Hence, any rules’ foreside created from node H could only be 
a single descriptor 'kp  , and for 
' '{ }kp X Y? ?  ? , rule 
'p X p=>  ?  is irredundant. 
Theorem2. If node '( , )H X X=  in the lattice has parent 
nodes with the number of d ,which are  '1 1 1( , )M Y Y= ?
'
2 2 2( , )M Y Y= ,… , ( , )d d dM Y Y= , then for any descriptor

V. EXPERIMENTATIONS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
To examine the above algorithm, We test the execution time 
with the increasing of records, and increase the number from 0 
at first to 1000 gradually.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The algorithms were carried out on a laptop with an Intel 
Pentium IV 1GHz CPU and 512M main memory, running 
Microsoft WindowsXP. All programs were coded in Microsoft 
Visual C++ 6.0. The experimental dataset consists of two kinds 
of data , a pwer transmission lines graph and then transformed 
into a talbe; The two attribute table of the power pole which 
respectively contain five attributes. An attribute has 2~10 
attribute values after generalization. During the mining of the 
single layer spatial association rule, these two tables are 
connected into a dataset of six attributes. The minimum support 
of each data layer is 6%, and the minimum confidence is 
75%.Figure3 shows the CPU-time of the experiments with iris 
data set when using Apriori algorithm and this method 
presented in this paper. Moreover, from the Figure.4, we can 
see that this approach based on Concept Lattice is quite 
effective in reducing memory. According to the experimental 
results, we can see that CPU-times decreases significantly 
when we use this algorithm based on Concept Lattice 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented a new an algorithm about spatial 
association rule mining based on concept lattice. A concept 
hierarchy defines a sequence of mappings from a set of low-level 
concepts to higher-level, more general concepts is introduced, 
Moreover, we gave association rule mining algorithm to build 
the coverage of formal concepts and to create optimal item-
sets from data records. The experimentation of the proposed 
method is done on a variety of data sets having different data 
formats (structured and unstructured). The proposed method is 
faster than Apriori.
