I. INTRODUCTION 
In the furious competition market, any information 
related to customers is very important to business managers. 
In front of massive commodity transaction information, how 
to find out the customers' consumption tendency, and then 
discover and obtain customers is necessary to enterprises[l]. 
In recent years, Data Mining Technique is widely used in 
marketing area, it has became the important method in 
gaining customer knowledge, supporting marketing 
decisions. We can attain much valuable and utility 
information from enormous data by using Data Mining 
Technology[2]. 
In actual trade, customers will not tell you when they 
would leave or he/she will buy which kind of products[3]. 
Any enterprise will make focus on how to increase profit by 
using current information resource. There are many methods 
to increase profit. Paper [4] uses cluster analysis method to 
enable researchers to understand the differences of major 
functions of quality systems at different stages, and give the 
method to adopt any obstacles that they will meet. Ming­
Chyuan Lin[5] et al. gives a approach combined AHP and 
TOPSIS to classify the the customers. ZhaoHua[6] et al. used 
boosting idea to optimize the decision tree algorithm and 
gives a reasonable data ming process to obtain potential 
customer. 
On the basis of data mining theory, this paper puts 
forward a reasonable data minging method which combined 
association rule and markov transition probability matrix to 
analyze the charcatiristics of customer purchasing behavior, 
which can minimize the range of related products, used to 
determine the optimal sales combination. This method can 
improve potential consumption capacity of consumers and 
can increase companies' income.

II. PRODUCT OPTIMAL COMBINATION MODEL 
A. Sequence combination method 
From the view of data mining, customer consumption 
behavior analyze can be assigned to classification problem. 
Paper [7] gives two kinds of combination classification: 
sequence combination and parallel combination. Sequence 
combination series two or more method models, the target 
values of the latter classifier come from the results which 
former one calculated; parallel combination parallels several 
classifiers, parallel combination shunt several classifiers, 
under the condition of given input parameters, every 
classifiers give respective classification results, then use 
combinatorial algorithm obtains the final classification result. 
In this paper, we combine association rules and Markov 
transfer matrix to classify customers. 
B. Association Rule 
Association rule is put forward by Rakesh Agrawal first, 
and it becomes a important subject in the data minimg field. 
The basis of association rule is basket analysis. The products 
in the basket always have internal connection. Through 
analyzing the sale data, we can know the potential relevance 
in the basket. Because the sale data comes from customer 
relation point, so the quality of the data for market basket 
analysis is low usuallyl'8]. Before mining, the data should be 
clean, association rule just used for discover the significant 
correlation in the customer purchase behaviors preliminary. 
In general case, the problem should be studied from two 
aspects: complexity and correlation. The complexity of rule 
is used for count the number of terms, the more the terms, 
the bigger of the complexity. Under the existing condition of 
cettain complexity, we consider the correlation of products. 
The size of relevance depends on the support threshold and 
confidence degree of products. Assuming that 
I = {ip i2 , ... , im} is the set of m different object, and 
given a sale database D ,  T is the subset of I, association 
rule can be understanded as X ? Y , where X, Yare 
all the subset of I, and also X n Y = ¢ . 
(I)We define that S as the support threshold of X ,if 
the percentage is s% in D 
(1) 
m is the total trade amount, Xi is the trade amount where 
i appeared in D . 
(2) We define that C is the support threshold of 
X ? Y , if the times Y appeared in D which is also 
appeared in X 
c.. = 
Yj 
lJ X. I 
Yj stands for the count of j where i also appeared. 
(2) 
If the confidence degree of rules exceeds the min 
confidence degree, we can conclude that the rule has a 
strong association; and what we should do is to find out the 
strong association in the data. 
In order to enhance the persuasion of analysis, we 
advanced some assumptions as follows: 
Al Ignore the influence of climate, time and season 
A2 There is no once buying behavior 
A3 Do not think of the factor of sex, age and state 
A4 Ignore the influence of decision time 
C. Markov process 
Markov process is a widely used method which takes an 
important role random process. The kinetic disciplinarian of 
a Markov chain lies on the Markov transition matrix. Markov 
chain decision method appears in many fields, Zeng Yi­
feng[9] et al.use Markov blanket induction algorithm to 
improve the classification performance.ln paper [10], Su Tao 
et al. give a new method to solve the proble of apital assert 
price, they use Markov process to decrease market risk and 
the result shows that the method is feasible. Yan Wei and 
Qian YU_yu[ll] use a.a.markov rolling forecast Method to 
provide a direction of the rational management in estate 
business. And no varying is the most notable features. In 
order to To facilitate the description, we cite the definition 
and nature of Markov as follows: 
Definition 1 Given that {Xn , n  E N+} is a random 
sequence, N+ = {O,1,2, ... } is a time set, and the estate 
set is J = {al,a2 , ••• ,} , we defines {Xn , n  E N+} is a 
Markov chain, if any n E N+ and where 
= P{Xn = ain I Xn_1 = ain_
)
 
Definition 2 We define {X n , n E N+} as 
homogeneous Markov chain, if any k -times transition 
probability P J k) ( m ,  n) always independent on m ,  and 
any k -times transition probability can be decided by once 
transition probability 0 
Once transition 
Pij =P{Xm
+
1 =jlXm =i} ,  
matrix is 
probability 
i,j E J .The 
is 
transfer 
555 
P = PJk) (i,j E J) 
And it has a property: 
i = 1,2 ... n 
j=1 
(3) 
(4) 
In the Markov process, it is available that the 
probabilities in the similar production can transfer to each 
other, and it is impossible to transfer in different kinds. So 
we assume that: 
A5 Customers always buy the relative products, and the 
non-relative products can be dismissed. The non-correlation 
product can be ignored. The correlation in independent 
products is O. The purpose of this article is finding out the 
optimum combination in different products, so we also 
assume that the correlation of self-dependent products is O. 
A6 The correlationship of products is irreversible, e.i. the 
correlated value of A->B is different from B->A. 
III. MARKOV ASSOCIATION MATRIX 
At first, we should select and tidy the sale data. We use 
equation (1 ) to find out the correlationship during the 
products, and ascertain the target which have the high 
correlation. And then use equator (2) to set the value of 
reliability. In this paper, we use binary reaction behavior 
model analyse[12] to express, ie. 1 means that the products 
have correlation and 0 means not. 
Because the cardinal number of different products is 
different from each other, which can't meet the demand of 
equation (4), so we should normalize the target data by 
theequation: 
n i = 1,2 ... m (5) 
L Cij 
j=1 
Calculated by equation (5), the initial tranSItIon 
probability matrix emerged and it can meet the qualification 
of closed diffuse. 
In order to simplify explaintion, we introduce the 
conception of first arrive, calculate the probability from one 
condition to the next one: 
00 
lij = Lit) 
n=1 (6) 
00 
In which 1",;; = " p .. p . ... p. . when 1". = 0, it J!, £.oJ lJl lth In-Il J ij 
j,oF j I';;s';;n-I 
express that from condition i can't arrive condition j; 
when lij = 1 , it means that from condition i do arrive 
condition j . And at that that time , we shoule compute the 
average cycle from i to j by equation (7). 
00 
flij = L nlijn (7) 
n=1 
Especially, when i = j, J.1i means the cycle period of i . 
After calculation, the association becomes more lumped. 
IV. EXAMPLE ANALYSIS 
In practical commodity transaction, we should analyse 
the data in order to find out the correlationship during 
different products. We give a simple sample to explain 
process of calculation. 
We choose 100 purchase records from sale data at 
random, and use equators (1) and (2) to process and find out 
the significant correlation. The results of support threshold 
and reliability is showed in table 1. 
TABLE 1. TABLE I STATISTICAL RESULTS OF SUPPORT THRESHOLD 
AND RELIABILITY 
Support Reliability(% ) 
threshold(% ) A B C D E F G 
A 60 0 70 61 40 43 28 63 
B 60 73 0 50 41 39 46 76 
C 50 78 67 0 45 39 27 65 
D 40 55 40 48 0 70 33 45 
E 40 57 51 40 67 0 32 53 
F 30 47 76 36 42 42 0 52 
G 60 68 80 55 53 43 33 0 
We set that Si > 50, Cij > 70 and select the 
objectsA,B,C,G to give a example which can meet constraint, 
and the estate set is I = {1,2,3,4} relatively. The sequence 
of number is showed as followes: 
0 70 61 63 
p'= 
73 0 50 76 
78 67 0 65 
68 80 55 0 
We use 0, 1 method to standardize the sequence of 
number, and use equator (5) to normalize the sequence and 
establish the initial transition probability matrix: 
p= 
0 1 0 0 
112 0 0 112 
1 0 0 0 
0 1 0 0 
After establishing the Markov transfer matrix, we use 
equator (6) to compute the probability from the initial state to 
the terminal state. 
Take h I for example: 
h', = PII = 0 
2 1 1  
hI = P12P21 =1x-=-
2 2 
556 
I 2 I 1 
hI =h, + hI + ... + hI =-
2 
So we can calculate that finally matrix by using the 
equator (6) 
1 
2 
1 
2 
1 
1 
2 
1 0 
1 0 
o 0 
1 0 
o 
1 
2 
1 
o 
From above calculation results, we can conclude that, 
state 12,22,21,42,34 all can arrive stable state, but after the 
further calculation by equator (7) 
J.112 = 1 
J.122 = 2 
J.131 = 1 
J.142 = 1 
J.134 = 3 
We can see that the transfer cycle of state 12, 31, 42 are 
all 1, the cycle of 22 is 2, and the cycle of 34 3, so state 
12,31,42 can arrive the stable state more easily. So at actual 
market selling operation, we can binding commodities 
AB, A C, BD to sale together. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper a model combined association rule and 
markov transition matrix has been presented. Searching over 
the history sale data, optimum combination of products for 
promote consumption has been built. The association rules 
used to explore the obvious association of products, and 
markov transition matrix is usde to estiblish the product 
combination. By using the new model, the income of 
company can be incresed quickly.
