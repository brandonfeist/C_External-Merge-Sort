Abstract—Since the fact that the non-signal roundabout allows 
less flow rate, and with the increasing of roundabout flow rate, 
series of problems have occurred in respect of traffic jam, 
rising of accident rate, growth of traffic delay and increasing of 
saturation degree, etc. Arrangement of signal control help to 
enhance the efficiency at roundabout and security, but there 
exist big difference for applicable conditions and traffic 
efficiencies under different signal control methods. The main 
concern of this text, on the foundation of Left-turn with Two -
stop Control Method at Roundabout, with consideration of the 
number of different entrance paths and on the basis of signal 
control theory and optimal method, is on the three control 
methods related with “Control of In-turn Discharge Clockwise 
at Signal-entrance Path”, “Control of In-turn Discharge 
Clockwise at Signal-entrance Path + Interlace of Minor Flow” 
and “Association Roundabout Control at Multi--entrance 
Path”. It is on such a basis that the methods analyzing the 
effect rule on stop rate coming from the signal cycle and space 
strategy parameters and radius of island under different signal 
control methods by applying approaches of numerical 
calculation and experimental traffic engineering. The research 
achievement will perfect the theory system for signal control 
roundabout and provide technical support for the 
reconstruction of uncontrolled roundabout as well as selection 
of signal control method of roundabout, meaning significant 
application value.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Uncontrolled roundabout features in less conflict points, 
non-necessity of stopping and simpler way of management. 
The increasing demand for roundabout traffic have brought 
forth series problems at Uncontrolled roundabout in respect 
of traffic jam, rising of accident rate, growth of vehicle delay 
and increasing of saturation. Signalizing at roundabout has 
greatly improved the traffic capability of roundabouts while 
differences exist between condition of adaptability and 
traffic efficiency under different signal controlling methods. 
In addition to difference between traffic capacity and real-
time vehicle delay, there is bigger difference for stop rate, 
especially for stop rate of left-turn traffic flow. Stop rate 
affects the vehicle's fuel consumption and automotive 
emission. Less stop rates as possible will effectively reduce 
environment pollution. Hence, it is necessary to make a 
study on the adaptability for various methods when 
searching for the optimization method to effectively lower 
the stop rate. 
II. RESEARCH REVIEW 
It is divided into two directions of unsigned-controlled 
roundabout and controlled roundabout in the related 
domestic research. For the research of unsignal-controlled 
roundabout, it mainly involves the study of traffic 
characteristics and its applicable conditions, capacity, delay, 
safety and geometrical design, etc. in which, for most cases, 
the capacity and delay of roundabout entrance under 
different conditions of entrance and loop is calculated by 
using gap-acceptance model[1][2][3][4]. For foreign researchers, 
they tend to connect safety with geometrical design of 
roundabout which is made under guidance of safety 
requirements for vehicle and pedestrians[5][6][7]. In the 
countries of the States, Australia and Britain, numbers of 
national regulations have been issued concerning 
roundabout design, which have laid a foundation for the 
study of space related optimal design of signal-controlled 
roundabout and evaluation of traffic efficiency. 
The study on signal-controlled roundabout started at a 
later time and according to designing guidance for 
roundabout in the States and Australia, it qualitatively 
regulates that signal control could be implemented for 
certain entrances if necessary, stressing that it should be 
used with great care and should not be used for purpose of a 
long-term solution to traffic jam. Baranowski[8] made a 
study on the signal control method for roundabout 
pedestrians, exploring condition and safety of arranging 
signal for roundabout pedestrians. Akçelik made a study on 
the limit control of capacity at entrance of roundabout[9]. We 
study the relevant research in our country in 1998, which 
was initially raised by researchers from engineering 
department of Tongji University[10][11]. They established 
basic principle and approach for left-turn with two-stop 
control at roundabout and gave it a good study in the way of 
traffic law, signal timing method, applicable condition, 
optimization control method and efficiency evaluation. Mr.

Ao Guchang[12] put forward signal control method for 
roundabout under condition without of straight flow. 
Researches from home and abroad focus on the field of 
non-signal controlled roundabout, with less time in the study 
of signal-controlled roundabout. It needs further research in 
terms of capacity of signal-controlled roundabout, condition 
of geometric topology, demand for mixed traffic flow and 
adaptability of signal control at roundabout. 
III. INTRODUCTION TO SIGNAL CONTROL METHOD AT 
ROUNDABOUT 
A. Control of in-turn discharge clockwise at signal-
entrance path 
In this control method, each entrance lane discharge In-
turn of clockwise, see Fig. 1. 
This control method could be converted into a one-way 
closed intersection group (Fig. 2). To take the five-fork 
intersection as a example, it could be regarded as an 
intersection group made of five intersections of A, B, C, D 
and E. To select datum point of coordination control, to set 
the Max delay as optimization target and to choose signal 
period, phase difference and queuing length as constraint 
condition, the optimization of other parameters will be 
carried out. 
B. Control of in-turn discharge clockwise at signal-
entrance path + interlace of minor flow 
With consideration of order and efficiency of multi-fork 
roundabout, on the basis of Control of In-turn Discharge 
Clockwise at Signal-entrance Path, the interlace of secondary 
traffic flow is introduced (Fig. 3), i.e. to treat a main flow 
and several secondary flows which have least conflicts 
between each other as the same phase. 
C. Association roundabout control at multi--entrance path 
Three phases are usually designed for three-fork 
roundabout and twice is released within one period at each 
entrance (Fig. 4). Two phases are usually designed for four-
fork roundabout (Fig. 5). Twice is released within one 
period at each entrance of five-fork roundabout, and release 
is made clockwise at entrance lane (Fig. 6). Three phases 
are arranged at for six-fork roundabout and release is made 
clockwise at entrance lane (Fig. 7). 
Associated Roundabout Control at Multi-entrance Path 
includes, in two ways, the coordination of entrance signal 
and loop signal, and then the coordination with loop signal. 
The optimization model of timing parameters is established 
under concept of equisaturation, but the space constraint of 
loop parking should be realized. When flow ratio between 
different entrance lanes in the same phase is unbalanced, or 
queuing vehicles inside the loop go beyond conflict point (or 
stop line), which influences the normal traffics, it is 
suggested to take coordination measures of delayed start-up, 
early disconnection or start-up and late disconnection for 
green signals of conflict flows. 
IV. CALCULATION METHOD FOR STOP RATE OF SCR 
When discharging method is adopted in sequent 
clockwise order at one-way entrance in terms of roundabout, 
stop rate will be influenced by the control of the first stop 
line at entrance lane while it will be mutually influenced by 
the control of both the first stop line at entrance lane and the 
second stop line on circular road when the cooperative 
discharging method is adopted at multi way entrance. 
A. Stop rate for the first stop line of entrance lane 
Similar with ordinary intersections, the motion state for 
vehicles at the first stop line of entrance lane of signal-
controlled circular road usually applies the calculation 
method for intersection stop rate[14] . The stop rate af of the 
first stop line at SCR entrance lane is decided by the sum of  
stop rate between “random and over-saturation stop rate” 0f  
and “normal block” uf , i.e.

In which, ?t is the correction factor set after complete 
consideration of a full stop, Q0 is the average number of

signal circulation under saturation (pcu), Qt is the traffic 
capacity at direction of such entrance (pcu /s), s is the

saturation of entrance lane, T is the time interval of research 
for average delayed queuing vehicles(s), x0 is the saturation 
threshold at entrance lane, g is the effective green time(s), ? 
is the green ratio. y is the flow ratio. 
B. Stop rate for the second stop line of roundabou 
1) State analysis for left-turn vehicles at the second stop 
line: In accordance with the relationship of driving time th 
that the left-turn front vehicle goes from the first stop line to 
the second stop line and the effective green time geLa for 
left-turn at the first stop line, the motion state of left-turn 
vehicles could be divided into the following three (See Fig. 
8): 
• The light turns green for the second stop line when 
the left-turn front vehicles arrive at the second stop 
line, i.e. 2Igt
a
eLh +> . The left-turn flow does not 
stop at the second stop line, encountering no jams 
and the stop rate is 0. 
• The light simultaneously turns green for the second 
stop line when the left-turn front vehicles arrive at 
the second stop line, i.e. 2Igt
a
eLh += . The left-turn 
flow does not stop at the second stop line, 
encountering no jams and the stop rate is 0. 
38
• The light turns red for the second stop line when the 
left-turn front vehicles arrive at the second stop line, 
i.e. 2Igt
a
eLh +< . The left-turn front flows stop at 
the second stop line, restarting until the light turns 
green at the second stop line, which will drive into 
the entrance lane, leaving the roundabout and the 
left-turn vehicles encounter jams. 
When the design speed is set certain, th is merely related 
with the geometric conditions inside the roundabout while 
geLa relates with the signal cycle of roundabout as well as 
with the relevant control parameters, including the left-turn 
green ratio at the first stop line. To change the relationship 
between th and geLa into the relationship between geometric 
conditions of roundabout and control scheme for 
roundabout[10] , we obtain:

V. RELEVANCE BETWEEN FACTORS OF TIME-SPACE AND 
STOP RATE 
Besides the main factors of regular road and traffic 
conditions influencing the stop rate of other factors[11] of 
signal-controlled crossings, the number of lanes, central 
island radius of roundabout, signal cycle and green intervals 
are also included. This text mainly analyzes the relevance 
between central island radius, signal cycle and stop rate. 
To indicate the influence under such control mode 
coming from the central island radius and signal cycle, 
certain parameters are supposed to be at definite values. 
From the point of physical meaning of parameters, we 
presume that the roundabout belongs to the type of 
orthogonal crossing and the number of entrance lanes, the 
number of roundabout lanes and the number of exist lanes 
match. The saturation flow for straight forward lanes of 
entrances is 1650 pcu/h and saturation flow for left-turn 
lanes is 1550 pcu/h, which are symmetrically matching. 
A. Analysis on stop rate for control method of synergistic 
discharge at multi entrance lane 
1) Relevance between stop rate and signal cycle: On the 
basis of above calculation method via using VISSIM 
simulation results for model modification, we obtain variety 
laws of stop rate for straight forward and average left-turn 
vehicles with the changes of signal cycle under the control 
method for synergistic discharging at multi entrance lane of 
roundabout. Refer to Fig.9 and 10. 
It could be found that: 
• The stop rate of average straight forward vehicles 
varies little with the changes of central island radius 
under the synergistic control of discharging at multi 
entrance lane of roundabout, generally around 
0.6~0.7 time/pcu. 
• The stop rate for average left-turn vehicles increases 
at the beginning with the radius growth of central 
island while it tends to be stable when the radius of 
central island reaches certain value. The value is 
generally around 1.3~1.5 time/pcu. 
2) Relevance between stop rate and radius of central 
island of roundabout: On the basis of above calculation 
39
method via using VISSIM simulation results for model 
modification, we obtain variety laws of stop rate for average 
vehicles with the changes of central island radius under the 
control method for synergistic discharging at multi entrance 
lane of roundabout. From Fig.11, it could be found that: 
• The stop rate of average straight forward vehicles 
varies little with the changes of central island radius 
under the synergistic control of discharging at multi 
entrance lane of roundabout, generally around 
0.6~0.7 time/pcu. 
• The stop rate for average left-turn vehicles slightly 
increases at the beginning with the radius growth of 
central island while it decreases when the radius of 
central island grows at certain value. The smaller the 
cycle is, the more obvious the downtrend will be. 
B. Analysis on stop rate for control method of orderly 
discharge clockwise at single entrance lane 
For roundabout in the control mode of orderly discharge 
clockwise at single entrance lane, stop rate is mainly 
reflected at the fist stop line while the stop rate of the first 
sop line is not influenced by the radius of central island of 
roundabout, which is only influenced by the traffic control 
parameters, e.g. signal cycle, etc. By adopting the 
calculation mode for the stop rate at the first stop line of 
entrance lane and by using VISSIM simulation results for 
model modification, we obtain variety laws for the stop rate 
of average vehicle with changes of signal cycle when it is 
controlled by the discharging control of single entrance lane 
at roundabout, refer to Fig. 12. 
It could be found that the total stop rate of average 
vehicle at intersections (ratio for left-turn and straight 
forward is 1:2) will slightly increase with the growth of 
signal cycle, usually around 0.7~0.8. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Arrangement of signal control at roundabout can greatly 
help to increase the traffic capacity and safety and there lies 
difference for applicable conditions and traffic efficiency 
under different methods. This research puts forward three 
control methods concerning auto vehicles at signal-
controlled crossings, establishes stop rate models for the 
first stop line at entrance lane of signal-controlled crossings 
and the second stop line of roundabout and analyzes the 
influence laws on the stop rate of signal-controlled crossings 
caused by the signal cycle of time & space parameters and 
radius of central island under the two different modes of 
method of synergistic roundabout control discharged at 
multi entrance lanes and control method of orderly 
discharge clockwise at single entrance lane. 
Researches show that the signal cycle under two control 
methods is less influential on stop rate. With precondition of 
the same signal cycle, the stop rate for control method of 
orderly discharge clockwise at single entrance lane is 0.7~0.8, 
the stop rate for straight forward vehicles synergistically 
discharging at multi entrance lane is 0.6~0.7, stop rate for 
left-turn vehicles is 1.3~1.5. Hence, when the straight 
forward vehicle ratio at roundabout is more than 85%, the 
stop rate will be smaller for control method of synergistically 
discharging vehicles at multi entrance lane. Meanwhile, 
under certain signal cycle conditions, the bigger the radius of 
central island, the smaller the totally average stop rate at 
intersections will be. The research result has provided us 
with quantitative basis in theory when choosing signal 
control method of roundabout.
