Abstract
Discovery the association between web pages is an im-
portant task as the rapid growth of web data. This article
uses the fuzzy method to discover generalized fuzzy associa-
tion rules among the Web pages from Web logs. In the paper,
whether a web page is visited or not and time duration on
it are considered two important factors to reflect users’ in-
terest and preference. Numerical time duration is fuzzified
into a corresponding fuzzy variable with membership val-
ues. The mined rule has the form as page(fuzzy duration)
? page(fuzzy duration). These rules can reflect associa-
tion among Web pages with fuzzy duration. By the analysis
of the example, the generalized fuzzy association rules can
be effectively mined in a sustainable computational period
from Web user access patterns in Web logs.
Keyword: fuzzy web mining; fuzzy association rules;
fuzzy variable; user access pattern
1. Introduction
WWW not only creates huge profits to web designers
and operators, but also brings tremendous challenges. User
can move from a web site to another one easily. If a web
site does not meet the needs of users in a short time, then
the chairman of the user relative to another site soon. There-
fore, it is especially important to understand the needs and
characteristics of Web users. Web mining can be regarded
as extracting implicit structural information from structural
or semi-structured data sets. In other words, it can be seen
to discover data association from the given data sets. In the
past many web usage mining algorithms were proposed to
find interesting web access patterns from web logs[2, 8, 10].
Chen et al. [2] introduced the concept of using the maximal
forward reference to break down user session into transac-
tions for mining frequent traversal patterns. Spiliopoulou
et al. [8] proposed an algorithm for building an aggre-
gating tree from Web logs, then mining traversal patterns
by MINT mining language. Xing et al.[10]didn’t mine in-
teresting web access patterns only by frequencies of vis-
ited web pages. They thought support and preference of
web pages were used to extract interesting web access pat-
terns. Deriving association rules from transaction databases
is most commonly seen in data mining. It discovers re-
lationships among items such that the presence of certain
items in a transaction tends to imply the presence of cer-
tain other items. In the past, many researchers proposed
several mining algorithms for finding association rules[1].
Recently, the fuzzy set theory has been used more and more
frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity
and similarity to human reasoning [3]. Hong et al. [3]and
Lo et al. [6] used fuzzy set theory to efficiently discover
relationships among items from database.
Whether a web page is visited or not discloses the inter-
est of web users. Besides, duration on web pages is also an
important factor to reflect users’ interest. In addition, nu-
merical or scalar data directly was mapped into a partition
interval by traditional methods. This mapping approach is
clearly not sufficient. Using fuzzy approach, an element
for a collection doesn’t only take 1 or 0 and is extended to
[0,1]. This ”soft” transition eases the border ”hard” ques-
tions. Thus, this paper thus focuses on designing a sophis-
ticated fuzzy web mining algorithm to find relationships
among web pages. During the mining process, time du-
rations are transformed as corresponding fuzzy linguistic
variables. The proposal provided by Srikant and Agrawal
is improved to discover interesting fuzzy association rules
from web logs. Finally an example is given to verify the
proposed method. Experiments show that the algorithm can
effectively mine interesting rules for the understanding of
the needs and characteristics of web users.
2. Preliminary
Zadeh [11] proposed the notion of fuzzy set in 1965.
Later many researchers enriched and reinforced fuzzy the-
ory, such as Nahmias [7] and Liu [4]. In this section, some
basic concepts and results of fuzzy variable are reviewed.
                                                                                                                                          2475
Definition 1 A fuzzy variable ? is defined as a function from
a possibility space (?,P(?),Pos) to the set of real num-
bers, where ? is a universe, P(?) is the power set of ?,
and Pos is a possibility measure defined on P(?).
Definition 2 Let ? be a fuzzy variable on the possibility
space (?,P(?),Pos). Then its membership function is de-
rived from the possibility measure by
?(x) = Pos{? ? ?|?(?) = x}, x ? R. (1)
Definition 3 (Liu and Liu [5]) The expected value of a
fuzzy variable ? is defined as
E[?] =
? ?
0
Cr{? ? r}dr ?
? 0
??
Cr{? ? r}dr, (2)
provided that at least one of two integrals is finite. The cred-
ibility of a fuzzy event {? ? r} can be represented by
Cr{? ? r} = 1
2
[Pos{? ? r}+ Nec{? ? r}]. (3)
3. Algorithm of extraction fuzzy association
rules
Web server access log file contains a large number
of user’s browsing information, which reveals the user’s
browsing behavior. Web log data original data needs pre-
processing such as cleaning, user identification, session
identification and transaction identification. Whether a web
page is visited or not reflects the interest of web users. And
time duration on a web page discloses the interesting de-
gree of web users. Thus original web data is processed as
{web page 1(time duration 1), web page 2(time duration
2),· · ·, web page n(time duration n)}, which is named as
user access pattern. All user access patterns are stored in
the database Ds.
Firstly, user access patterns are fuzzified. Time duration
on each web page is denoted by a corresponding fuzzy lin-
guistic variable with its membership value. The method can
be described as follows.
Algorithm 1 Preprocessed algorithm
Input : n web access patterns, membership function sets
Output : n fuzzy web access patterns with fuzzy linguistic
variable
step 1. Get the corresponding membership functions of
time durations on all web pages by experts opinions
or by methods introduced in [9]. Each membership
function corresponds to a fuzzy region. Assume there
exist s different fuzzy regions. Each fuzzy region is
characterized as corresponding fuzzy linguistic vari-
able ?i, (i = 1, · · · , s).
step 2. Each time duration tk on web page wk visited by
user Di is transformed as fuzzy linguistic variable with
its membership values.
u1i,k(wk.?1) + · · ·+ uji,k(wk.?j) + · · ·+ usi,k(wk.?s)
The generalized mining algorithm combined with fuzzy
variables and generalized data mining technology can be
used to find web interesting rules from web access patterns.
The algorithm is given as follows.
Algorithm 2 Fuzzy generalized mining algorithm
Input: n fuzzy web access patterns with fuzzy linguis-
tic variable, predefined minimum support ?,predefined
minimum confidence ?.
Output: fuzzy generalized association rules
step 1. Each web access pattern is transformed as corre-
sponding fuzzy pattern with fuzzy linguistic variable
using method introduced in algorithm 1.
step 2. Calculate the scalar cardinality Countj(1 ? j ?
s) in every fuzzy region for each web access pattern
Di(1 ? i ? n) by the following equation.
Countj =
n?
i=1
?jk,i, (4)
where ?jk,i is the value of membership function of time
duration ti in the jth fuzzy region.
step 3. if Counttk =
s
max
j=1
Countjk(t is the label of a
fuzzy region), then the corresponding fuzzy linguistic
variable of t is used to express the fuzzy characteristic
of the web page.
step 4. Check the value counttk =
s
max
j=1
countjk in range
?j(1 ? j ? s). If it is greater than or equal to the
predefined minimum support ?, Put it into a frequent
1-itemset, that is L1 = {?j ? ?, 1 ? j ? s}.
step 5. Generate candidate 2-itemset C2 from L1.
step 6. For each item S = (s1, s2) in the newly formed
candidate 2-itemset C2 do the following steps :
Compute the fuzzy value of each S by the following
equation.
us = u1i1,k1(wk1.?1) ? u2i2,k2(wk2.?2). (5)
If the minimum number of operations is for
the intersection, then take the smallest us =
min(uj1i1,k1, u
j2
i2,k2). If it is greater than or equal to the
                                                                                                                                          2476
predefined minimum support ?, Put it into a frequent
2-itemset L2.
Calculate the scalar cardinality of the model S. If
its scalar cardinality is higher or equal to the minimum
support ?, then the model S is put in the L2.
step 7. If L2 is empty, quit the algorithm. Otherwise con-
tinue the next step.
step 8. Set r = 2, where r is the number of items of the
current frequent items.
step 9. Generate candidate item Cr+1 from Lr by Apriori
algorithm.
step 10. For each new r + 1-itemset Cr+1
(s1, s2, · · · , sr+1) do the following steps:
[a.] Calculate the fuzzy value of S by the
following equation.
us = u1 ? u2 ? · · · ? ur+1 (6)
where uj is the membership value of the fuzzy item sj .
If the minimum operator uses intersection operation,
then us = minr+1j=1 uj .
[b.] Calculate the scalar cardinality of the model
S by the following equation.
Counts =
n?
i=1
uis (7)
[c.] if counts is higher or equal to the prede-
fined minimum support ?, put the model S in Lr+1.
step 11. If Lr+1 is empty, continue the next step. Other-
wise set r = r + 1 and repeat the step 9-11.
step 12. For all frequent q-itemset Lq(including item
(s1, s2, · · · , sq), construct all possible association
rules.
(s1 ? s2 ? · · · ? sk?1 ? sk+1 ? · · · ? sq).
step 13. Compute the confidence of the above association
rules by the following equation.
Con =
n?
i=1
uis
n?
i=1
(uis1 ? · · · ? uisk, uisk+1 ? · · · ? uisq
(8)
where Con denotes the confidence of a association
rule.
step 14. Retain the rules whose confidence is greater than
or equal to the predefined minimum confidence ?.
step 15. Output the gained rules to the users as the inter-
esting rules.
4. Analysis of an example
In this section, an example is given to illustrate the pro-
posed fuzzy generalized mining algorithm.
4.1 An example
Because browsing information of all users are stored in
the Web log, so we extract user data from the Web logs.
User data consists of two parts, in the Web log is expressed
as (Urlik, tik), in which Urlik and tik denote the web page
and the time duration on it visited by the ith user. Assume
the extracted data is listed as follows.
Table 1. User access pattern from the log data
Client Id Browsing sequences
1 (A,30), (B,42), (D,118), (E,91)
2 (A,92), (B,89), (F,120)
3 (A,50), (B,61), (D,42), (G,98), (H,115)
4 (A,70), (C,92), (G,85), (H,102)
5 (A,40), (B,35), (D,112)
6 (A,52), (B,89), (G,92), (H,108)
Assume membership functions of time duration on web
pages by experts systems are shown as short(0,0,20,70),
middle(20,70,90,120) and long(90,120,140,140).
According to the given algorithm, data mining process is
described below.
Step 1: Fuzzy variables with membership values are
adopted to describe users’ data items in table 1. For
example, the time duration on web page A 30 can
be denoted as (0.8(short), 0.2middle0.0long. Web
access pattern of the first user can be described as
(0.8(A.short), 0.2(A.middle))(0.56(B.short),
0.44(B.middle))(0.07(D.middle), 0.93(D.long))
(0.97(E.middle), 0.03(E.long)).
Step 2: Calculate the scalar cardinality Count in every
fuzzy region for each web access pattern. As an ex-
ample of fuzzy interval A.middle, its scalar cardinal-
ity=0.2+0.93+0.6+1+0.4+0.64=3.77. Repeat the step
in other fuzzy intervals. Then scalar cardinality in each
fuzzy interval on every web page can be gained.
Step 3-4: Determine count value in different fuzzy region
of each web page whether greater than or equal prede-
fined minimum support ?. In the example, ? is set 1.5.
Each item higher or equal ? is set in ?1.
                                                                                                                                          2477
Step 5-6: Generate C2 from L1. Get frequent 2-items from
C2.
Step 7-13: The possible association rules generated from
frequent items are listed as follows:
If A=middle,then B=middle
If B=middle,then A=middle
If G=middle,then A=middle
If G=middle,then H=long
If H=long,then G=middle
Compute their confidence by the equation (7).
Step 14: Retain the rules whose confidence is greater than
or equal to the predefined minimum confidence ?. As-
sume minimum confidence ? = 0.8, the following
rules are retained.
If A=middle,then B=middle
If G=middle,then A=middle
If H=long,then G=middle.
Setp 15: Output the above rules to the users as the interest-
ing rules.
4.2 Analysis of the results
The rule If A=middle,then B=middle is chosen as an ex-
ample to analyze. Its confidence is 0.84. The rule could
be interpreted as: If the access time for A page is middle,
then duration on the page B is for middle. The confidence is
0.84. The rule is reflected not only the association between
web page A and page B, but also web browsing on a time-
dependent. The previous algorithms considered only the
association between web pages. They neglected the page
browsing time is also an important factor to reflect users’
interest. In addition, fuzzy method is adopted to deal with
numerical or scalar data. This ”soft” transition eases the
border ”hard” questions.
5. Conclusions
As the rapid growth of data on the web, discovery and
analysis of useful information from the web have become
an increasingly important task. In the paper, an algorithm
based on fuzzy theory is provided to mine fuzzy generalized
association rules from user access patterns. Whether a web
page is visited or not and time duration on it are considered
two important factors to reflect users’ interest. Therefore,
the mined association rules not only are reflected the rela-
tionship between web pages, but also are related to the time
duration on these web pages. Thus they reflect more exactly
the user’s interest and preference.
