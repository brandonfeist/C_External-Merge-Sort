Abstract: Expression and definition of spatial relationship are 
crucial for spatial data mining. A new method of spatial 
relationship expression based on DE-9IM theory is proposed. 
The accurate spatial topology relationship between different 
objects can be expressed when this method is used in multi-level 
association rules discovery. The corresponding algorithm is also 
implemented and efficiency is enhanced by the MBR test and 
meta-rule. Experimental results show that the algorithm is valid 
and efficient.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Association rule discovery, as one of the important 
component of data mining, already has a deep and extensive 
research. Now it is used in spatial data mining after expansion 
and improvement by some researchers, and corresponding 
discovery algorithms of spatial association rules and even 
multi-level spatial association rules have been proposed. 
Association rules in geo-database are similar to those in 
transaction database, such as A?B[s%,c%],where A and B 
are predicates set, s% is the support of the rule, and c% is the 
confidence of the rule[1]. In A or B there are not only non-
spatial predicates but spatial predicates as well, which are 
used to describe relationship between spatial objects like 
topological relationship (intersect, overlap, disjoint), distance 
relationship(close-to, far-away, distance interval),locative 
relationship(left, west) and so on. And many researches of the 
spatial association rules are based on the hierarchy of spatial 
predicates defined as Figure.1. 
Figure 1.  The hierarchy of spatial predicates. 
Spatial predicates definition and concept hierarchy are 
discussed in this paper base on the dimension-extend 9 
intersect matrix model (DE-9IM). The hierarchy has some 
difference with Figure.1 but the DE-9IM from all the 
hierarchy has been described by regular expression. And 
corresponding discovery algorithm of multi-level spatial 
association rules is designed and has been tested with 
farmland geo-database of Hongta district in Yuxi city in 
Yunnan province. The algorithm is proved to be valid and 
efficient by experiment. 
II. DIMENSION-EXTEND 9 INTERSECT MATRIX 
Dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix is a extension from 9 
intersect matrix by Clementini and etc[6][7].

the polygons. And -1 in the function dim(a)=p,p?{-1,0,1,2} 
means empty set of the geometry, 0,1,2 respectively 
represents that a is 0 dimension(point), or 1 dimension(line),or 
2 dimension(polygon). 
The range of dim(x) is {-1,0,1,2} and in dimension-
extend 9 intersect matrix there are 49=262144 kinds of 
relationships theoretically. However, not so many relationship 
types are meaningful to the discovery of spatial association 
rules and thus they have a reduction in this paper. Firstly a 
symbol set{T, F, *} is introduced which makes dim(x) ?{-
1,0,1,2,T,F,*},where T denotes p?{0,1,2} and geometry ‘a’ 
exists, F denotes p=-1 and geometry ‘a’ is an empty set(not 
existed), * denotes p?{-1,0,1,2} and geometry ‘a’ can be an 
empty set or not. 
The dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix discussed 
above has 49 kinds of relationship theoretically and can finely 
define and distinguish the topology of the spatial objects. 
However, large amount of spatial relationship is too much 
detailed in data mining especially in macro data mining and 
many of them can not be even described in nature language[2]. 
Presented as Table 1, a macro spatial predicates concept 
hierarchy model is built based on dimension-extend 9 
intersect matrix and topology names and the row priority 
matrix are given below:

In the second column of the table, ‘P’ represents 0 
dimension geometric body, such as point and multi-point; ‘L’ 
represents 1 dimension geometric body, such as line and 
polyline; ‘A’ represents  2 dimension geometric body, such as 
polygon and multi-polygon. Take ‘L/A’ for example, it shows 
the topology relationship between line and polygon in DE-
9IM. 
For the DE-9IM is associated with the dimension of the 
corresponding geometric body, some examples will be given 
combined with the algorithms in next section. 
III. SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING 
A. Related Definitions 
Some definitions for the algorithm are given below [3]: 
Definition 1. The form of spatial association rules is: 
( )P P P Q Q Q s%  ,  c%  m n1 1k k? … ? ? … ? ? ? … ? ? … ?  
Where P1…Pk…Pm and Q 1…Q k…Q n have at least one spatial 
predicate, s% is the support of the rule, and c% is the confidence of 
the rule. 
In the data set‘s’, the support of the rule ‘?(P?Q/S)’is the radio of 
objects number , which meet the requirement P1?…?Pk?…?Pm 
and Q 1?…?Q k?…?Qm, and cardinal number of ‘S’. The 
confidence of the rule ‘?(P?Q/S)’ is the radio of  ‘?(P?Q/ S)’and 
‘?(P/S)’. 
Definition 2. If the support of predicates set ‘P’ is greater than or 
equal the least support threshold value ?min from k level, then ‘P’ is 
frequent in set ‘S’ with k levels and all its ancestors in concept tree 
are frequent on their corresponding levels. If the support of the rule 
P?Q/ S is greater than or equal the least support threshold value ?min 
from k level, then the ‘k’ level include the high rule. 
Definition 3. If predicates ‘P?Q’ is frequent in set ‘S’ and the 
support of the rule ‘P?Q/S’ is high, then the rule ‘P?Q/S’ is a 
strong rule. 
A conclusion from the above definitions shows that spatial 
association rules are still the multi-dimension association rules within 
the confidence-support framework. There are some problems existing 
in multi-dimension association rules mining: 1)When the support set 
is very high, the rules from mining are less and lack of 
representative. 2) When the support set is too low, the mining results 
would have an explosive growth and it was proved to be an 
significant appearance in practice. In order to enhance mining work 
efficiency, the concept ‘meta-rule’ was introduced in this paper. 
Definition 4. The following rule form is a meta-rule 
P P P Q Q Q1 k m 1 k n?…? ?…? ? ?…? ?…?  
Where Pi ( I= 1, …,m ) and Qj ( j= 1, …, n) are example predicates 
or predicate variables. 
Definition 5. If R is consistent with Mp, then spatial association 
rule ‘R’ obeys the meta-rule ‘Mp’. It is assumed that there is a meta-
rule as: 
is-a(X,land)?S(Y,X)?P(Y,M)?Q(Z,C) 
Then the following rule obeys the meta-rule: 
is-a(X,land) ?Crosses(Y,X)?is_a (Y,highway)?income (X,high)  
B. Algorithm design and implementation 
The multi-level spatial association rule algorithm proposed 
in the paper is as follows:

SDB from the input in the table is the geo-database 
composed of spatial data and attribute data.SDB is a geo-
database like ESRI ArcSDE, Oracle Spatial?Postgis and so 
no. 
Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set are reference object set 
and task-related object set. Because of the huge number of 
data during the spatial association rule mining and calculation 
time consumption, object in SDB are divided into two parts 
(Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set)[5]. Reference object is 
the subject for problem description and task-related object 
which is from spatial query has a spatial association 
relationship with reference object.  
For example, Ref_Obj_Set={farmland block?farmland 
income},TaskRel_Obj_Set={resident zone?traffic network
?water resources},Sp_CH is spatial predicates concept 
hierarchy.It is assumed that the Ref_Obj_Set in current 
mining task is farmland block (2 dimension polygon, A)in 
SDB,TaskRel_Obj_Set is resident zone (2 dimension polygon, 
A), traffic network (1 dimension line, L), water resources(1 
dimension line, L).According to table ?,the spatial predicates 
concept hierarchy is built as follows: 
 
Figure 2.  spatial predicates concept hierarchy 
As it shows in Figure.2 the spatial predicates concept 
hierarchy is divided into 4 levels(0?3).The number before 
the spatial predicate is serial number of the level and the brace 
under the predicate shows the row priority string model for 
0.G-Close to

the corresponding DE-9IM which is called DE-9IM String in 
the paper. Data mining task always begins from the 1st level 
min_sup[l] and min_conf[l] are respectively the least support 
and least confidence in the first level in Sp_CH. 
Now, the algorithm subject is explained in detail according 
to the serial number before each statement as follows: 
• (1) export Relevant_SDB  from geodatabase according 
to the input Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set. 
• (2) test the reference object and task-related object in 
Relevant_SDB by using MBR method (Minimal 
Bounding Rectangle). MBR method is always used as 
the geometric solution of spatial object and is defined 
such rectangle that completely contains the object[4]. 
The inherent defect of MBR lies in the inconsistency 
between the MBR relationship and practical topology 
relationship from objects. For example, if the two 
objects are overlap but the actual topology might be 
separated. However, because of the superset coverage 
character and less time consuming compared with DE-
9IM String determination, MBR method is fit for the 
spatial association rules mining in this paper. And after 
MBR test in 2nd step, the spatial predicates of  
Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set in Relevant_SDB 
is roughly divided into two types: one passed the MBR 
test and the other not passed. For the MBR test allows 
Positive Testing but not Negative Testing, then the 
spatial predicates not passing the MBR test are 
considered as disjoints (Disjoints , FF*FF****)in the 
following calculation and only those passed ones need 
further determination. The divided Relevant_SD is 
denoted as MBR_Relevant_DB.  
• (3) export spatial predicates table of reference object 
and task-related object that denoted by DE-9IM String 
from MBR_Relevant_DB(DE-9IM 
_Predicate_DB).The table contains detailed topology 
relationship of reference object and task-related object 
and its form will be expressed in the latter table ?. 
Divided information is used during the export process. 
• (4) make a recursion of each spatial predicates concept 
hierarchy and discover the corresponding spatial 
association rules. 
• (5) According to Figure.1, generalize the spatial 
predicates in E-9IM _Predicate_DB which means 
making each detailed DE-9IM String generalized to 
current concept hierarchy spatial predicates. As 
showed in table 3, the DE-9IM String generalization in 
the paper used regular expression.And in this step, the 
DE-9IM String using regular expression in DE-9IM 
_Predicate_DB will be generalized to corresponding 
spatial predicates.

• (6) discover association rules by using Apriori 
property and the detailed process is shown in 
mine_association_rules. And the algorithm uses meta-
rule when exports the strong association rules. 
Awaiting discovery rule form is defined in meta-rule 
including logic relationship, the number of example 
predicates and so on. The introduction of meta-rule 
enhanced the effectiveness of strong association rule. 
Moreover, heuristic information in original rule is used 
in mining process and candidate frequence k-predicate 
table will be straightly generated from frequence 1-
predicate table not using the gradually deduction 
method in the paper. Then after scaning DE-9IM 
_Predicate_DB, the support of each candidate k-
predicate table is calculated and the candidate k-
predicate which is no less than the least support in 
corresponding concept hierarchy will be chosen to 
built frequence k-predicate table. After that, according 
meta-rule and the least support of corresponding 
concept hierarchy, strong spatial association rules will 
be created from frequence k-predicate table.  
 
IV. EXPERIMENT  
Algorithm of spatial association rules based on DE-9IM is 
implemented by java language and the API class library of 
JTS(JAVA Topology Suite) is used to built the 9 intersect 
matrix of polygons. 
The following spatial association rules mining process used 
farmland spatial data of Hongta area in Yuxi city in Yunnan 
province and the algorithm proposed in this paper is also 
explained: 
SDB in this example is farmland decide-grade spatial 
database in Yunnan province which includes farmland blocks, 
altitude, water resources, area network, residential area, 
markets, central towns and other FeatureClass in most 
counties in Yunnan province. And each feature contains 
corresponding spatial information and attributes data. 
Ref_Obj_Set={farmland block?farmland incoming}, 
TaskRel_Obj_Set={traffic resources}. 
The farmland block in Ref_Obj_Set is a feature class, the 
farmland incoming is a field of the feature class and the 
attribute table is as follows: 
ObjcetID Geometry annual earnings   
Where the value of “annual earnings” has five different 
standards as ‘high’, ‘relatively high’, ‘medium’, ‘relatively 
low’ and ‘low’ after it has been discretization. 
The attribute table of traffic network feature class in 
TaskRel_Obj_Set is as follows: 
ObjcetID Geometry Road type 
Where its type coding range is 
{VillageRoad,highway,RailRoad}. 
The buffer method is used to make close-to relationship to 
Intersects and Far-away relationship to Disjoints. In this test, a 
ten meters buffer area of traffic network which is original 
polyline in spatial database is formed before data mining, 
which made the traffic network buffer area (task-related 
object)has an A/A relationship with farmland block(reference 
object ). Then they can be described by the spatial predicates 
hierarchy in Figure.2. 
Meta-rule: P(t,x)?Q(t,y) ?R(t,z). In order to simplified, 
the least support and confidence of each level had been set as 
20% and 75%. 
TABLE IV.  SPATIAL PREDICATE SEGMENTS

high 212101212 Highway

…… 
The results of spatial association rule is shown as follows:  
Rule 1:  
Is_a(X,”farmland block”) ?Disjoints(X,Highway)?farmland 
incoming(X,low) 
Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block away from 
the highway is ‘low’. 
Rule 2:  
Is_a(X,”farmland block”) ?
Crosses(X,VillageRoad)?farmland incoming (X,”medium”). 
Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block passed 
through by country road is ‘medium’. 
Rule 3: 
 Is_a(X,” farmland block”) ?
Touches(X,Highway)?farmland incoming (X,”medium”) 
Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block near by the 
highway is ‘medium’. 
According to the information from the land and resource 
expert, farmland profit is effected by the traffic status. The 
spatial association rules from this experiment can be applied 
in local farmland decide-grade work such as the weight 
decision of farmland grade affected by traffic factors. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Expression and definition of spatial relationship are 
important contents in spatial data mining algorithm. A new 
method used for multi-level spatial association rules discovery 
is proposed in the paper to express and define spatial predicate 
and classify concept hierarchy based on DE-9IM theory. And 
the corresponding algorithm using MBR test and meta-rule is 
also put forward to enhance the efficiency of the rule 
discovery process. The advantage of the new algorithm is the 
use of precise spatial topology between reference object and 
task-related object to discover rules. Finally the algorithm is 
tested in farmland decide-grade spatial association rules 
mining of Hongta district in Yuxi city in Yunnan province and 
proved to be efficient and valid. In the future, we will make 
research on the micro spatial data mining based on DE-9IM.
