Ahstract-The huge number of generated association rules 
limits the growth of more appropriate techniques to assist the 
decision maker. In this context, based on the theory of Formal 
Concept Analysis, we propose to extend the notion of Formal 
Concept through the generalization of the notion of itemset in 
order to consider the itemset as an intent, its support as the 
cardinality of the extent. Accordingly, we propose a new 
approach to extract interesting itemsets through the concept 
coverage. This approach uses a new quality-criteria of a rule: 
the relevance bringing a semantic added value to formal 
concept analysis approach to discover association rules. 
Keywords- association rules, formal concept analysis, quality 
measure. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Given the information density and mass accumulation of 
data, it was crucial to explore this information in order to 
extract meaningful knowledge. 
The "Concept" is a couple of intent and extent 
aiming to represent nuggets of knowledge. Recently, 
researchers have been striving to build theoretical 
foundations for data-Mining based on Formal Concept 
Analysis [1,2,3]. Several interesting proposals have appeared, 
related to association rules [4]. 
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of 
association rules mining based on Formal Concept Analysis. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We 
outline in Section 2 the association rules derivation problem. 
Section 3 introduces the mathematical background of FCA 
and its connection with the derivation of association rule 
bases. We present, in Section 4, an heuristic algorithm to 
calculate the optimal itemsets from rows of data. Section 5 
describes the results of the experimental study. Illustrative 
examples are given throughout the paper. Section 6 
concludes this paper and points out future research directions. 
II. ASSOCIATION RULES DERIVATION 
Commonly, the number of the generated association rules 
grows exponentially with the number of data rows and 
attributes. This can reach hundreds' of thousands using 
only some thousands of data rows. So, their 
comprehension and their interpretation become a hard task. 
To remedy to this problem, several methods were 
proposed [17]. 
The commonly 
millions of rules -
generated thousands and even 
among which many are redundant 
(Bastide et aI., 2000; Stumme et aI., 2001; Zaki, 2004) 
-[5, 6, 7, 8] encouraged the proposal of more 
discriminating techniques to reduce the number of 
reported rules. 
This pruning can be based on patterns defined by the user 
(user-defined templates), on Boolean operators (Meo et aI., 
1996; Ng et aI., 1998; Ohsaki et aI., 2004; Srikant et aI., 
1997) [9,10,11,12]. 
The number of rules can be greatly reduced through pruning 
focusing on additional information namely the taxonomy of 
items (Han, & Fu, 1995) or on a metric of specific interest 
(Brin et aI., 1997) (e.g., Pearson's correlation or x2-test) 
[13, 14]. More advanced techniques that produce only 
lossless information limited number of the entire set of rules, 
called generic bases (Bastide et aI., 2000). The generation 
of such generic bases heavily draws on a battery of 
results provided by formal concept analysis (FCA) 
(Ganter & Wille, 1999) [15]. 
Primitively, the pruning strategy of association rules is 
based on crucial techniques namely the frequency of the 
generated pattern through discarding all the itemsets having 
a support less than MinSup, and the strength of the 
dependency between premise and conclusion by pruning 
all the rules having a confidence less than MinCon£ 
To prune effectively the extracted association rules, 
some authors [16] introduce another measures. In fact, 
Bayardo et al propose the conviction measure. Moreover, 
Cherfi et al [17] suggest five different measures such as the 
benefit (interest) and the satisfaction. Maddouri et al provide 
the gain measure [18]. 
In this paper, we introduce a new measure: the relevance. 
Indeed, it is backboned on the Formal Concept Analysis 
[19, 20]. Assuming that an itemset is completely represented 
by a formal concept as a couple of intent (the classic itemset) 
and extent (its support), it combines the support of the rule 
with the length of the itemset. Thus, we propose to include a 
semantic aspect on association rules extraction by taking into 
account the confidence measure during the selection of 
frequent itemsets during association rules generation. 
III. FORMAL BACKGROUND 
In the following, we recall some key results from the 
Galois lattice-based paradigm in FCA and its applications to 
association rules mining.

A. Basic notions 
In the rest of the paper, we shall use the theoretical 
framework presented in [20]. 
Let ° be a set of objects, P a set of properties and R a 
binary relation defined between ° and P [19, 20l

01 I I 0 0 
02 I I 0 0 
03 0 I I 0 
04 0 I I I 
05 0 0 I I 
Definition 1 [19]: A formal context (0, P, R) 
consists of two sets ° and P and a relation R between ° 
and P. The elements of ° are called the objects and the 
elements of P are called the properties of the context. In 
order to express that an object 0 is in a relation R with a 
property p, we write oRp or (0, p) E R and read it as "the 
object 0 has the property p". 
Definition 2 [19]: For a set A?O of objects and a set 
B?P of properties, we define : 
The set of properties common to the objects in A : 
A?={pEP I oRp for all oE A} 
The set of objects which have all properties in B : 
B<II ={oEO I oRp for all pE B} 
The couple of operators ( ?, <II) is a Galois Connection. 
Definition 3 [19]: A formal concept of the context (0, P, 
R) is a pair (A, B) with A?O, B?P, A ?=B and B<II =A. 
We call A the extent and B the intent of the concept (A, 
B). 
Definition 4 [19]: The set of all concepts of the context 
(0, P, R) is denoted by <l> (0, P, R). An ordering relation «<) 
is easily defined on this set of concepts by : 
(AI, BI)« (A2, B2) ¢:> AI?A2 ¢:> B2?Bl. 
FIGURE I. CONCEPT LATTICE OF THE CONTEXT (0, P, R)

In this paragraph, we recall basic theorem for Concept 
Lattices [19]: 
<l> (0, P, R, «) is a complete lattice. It is called the 
concept lattice or Galois lattice of (0, P, R), for which 
infimum and supremum can be described as follow: 
SUpj F I (Aj,Bj)=(( U j F I Aj) ? <II, (n j F I BD) 
In? F I (Aj, Bj)=( n j F I Aj , ( U j F I Bj) <II ?) 
Example [18]: table I illustrates the notion of formal 
context (0, P, R).The latter is composed of five objects {oI, 
02, 03, 04, 05} and four properties {A, B, C, D}. The 
concept lattice of this context is drawn in Figure 1 
containing eight formal concepts. 
Definition 5 [19]: Let (0, p) be a couple in the context (0, 
P, R). The pseudo-concept PC containing the couple (0, p) 
is the union of all the formal concepts containing (o,p). 
Definition 6 [20]: A coverage of a context (0, P, R) 
is defined as a set of formal concepts CV={RE I , RE 
2, ... , RE n } in <l> (0, P, R), such that any couple (0, p) in the 
context (0, P, R) is included in at least one concept of CV.

Example [18]: 
Considering the formal context (0, P, R) depicted by 
table 1, the figure 2.a represents the pseudo-concept 
containing the couple (03, B) being the union of the concepts 
FC2 and FCs. 
A coverage of the context is formed by the three concepts: 
{FC4, FCs, FC6} such as: 
FC4 is the concept containing the items ({ 0 1, 02}, {A, 
B}); 
FCs is the concept containing the items ({ 03, 04}, {B, 
C}); 
• FC6 is the concept containing the items ({ 04, 
o5}, {C, D}). 
The lattice constitutes concept coverage. 
IV. DISCOVERY OF OPTIMAL ITEM-SETS 
The most expensive step to derive association rules is 
the computation of the frequent itemsets [4]. Indeed, this 
step consists of applying, iteratively, some heuristics to 
calculate candidate itemsets. At the iteration i, we combine 
the item sets of the iteration i-I. After that, the support 
V2-521 
2010 International Coriference on Educational and Information Technology (ICEIT 2010) 
threshold (MinSup) is used to prune non-frequent 
candidates. The itemsets of iteration i-I, are also discarded. 
We keep the remaining itemsets of the latest iteration 
n with n is the number of properties in the formal context. 
Two characteristics are used in the association rules 
derivation: 
Support: is the cardinality of the set of objects which 
verify the rule. In Formal Concept Analysis, it refers to the 
extent of a formal concept. 
Cardinality of the Itemset: is the number of properties of 
the itemset. In Formal Concept Analysis, it refers to the 
intent of a formal concept. 
Assuming that the intent is not sufficient to represent the 
association rule, the latter is completely related to a formal 
concept namely both its intent and its extent. Having a 
support represented by the cardinality of the extent, a highly 
qualified selection of itemsets must be done according to the 
intent of the formal concept of the rule. 
Moreover, the association rule generated from the formal 
concept should take into account the quality of the 
relationship between the head and the body of the rule. 
To formalize the new criterions, we give the following 
definitions. 
Definition 7 : Let FCj = (Aj , BD be a formal concept. We 
define: 
Length of a concept FCj: the number of properties 
in the intent Bj of the concept. 
Width of a concept FCj: the number of objects in 
the extent A j of the concept. 
Conf of a concept FCj: the maximum confidence of 
the set of rules generated from the concept FCj. 
Relevance of a concept: is a function of the width 
the length and the confidence of the concept, given by: 
Relevance(FCJ= (length(FCJ+ conf(FCJ) * 
(length(FCJ+ width(FCJ) 
The relevance measure depends on the number of 
properties. In fact, a less number of properties, a less value of 
relevance is noted. Having more properties induced to higher 
relevance. Moreover, if we have a higher number of 
properties and objects, a higher value of relevance is affected. 
Increasing the confidence of the concept induce to higher 
value of relevance. 
Definition 8 : A formal concept FCj = (Aj,Bj) containing 
a couple (0, p) is said to be optimal if it maximizes the 
relevance function. 
Definition 9 [20]: A coverage CV={ FC1, FCb ... , 
FCk} of a context (0, P, R) is optimal ifit is composed 
by optimal concepts. 
Example [18]: An illustrative example of the pseudo­
concept is sketched by figure 2. b represents the optimal 
concept FCs containing the couple (03, B). Figure 2.c 
represents the non optimal concept FC2 containing the couple 
(03, B). 
The optimal coverage of the context (0, P, R) is 
formed by three optimal concepts: {FC4, FCs , FC6}. FC4 is 
the concept containing the items ({ 0 1, 02}, {A, B}). FCs is 
the concept containing the items ({ 03, 04}, {B, C}). FC6 is 
the concept containing the items ( {04, 05}, {C, D} ). 
A. Heuristic Searchingfor Optimal Concept 
The pseudo-concept, denoted by PCF, contammg the 
couple (0, p), is the union of all the concepts containing 
(0, p). It is computed according to the relation R by the set 
of objects described by p, then {p} ?, and the set of 
properties describing the object 0, so {o} ..... Where (?, .... ) 
is the Galois connection of the context (0, P, R). 
When we determinate the pseudo-concept PCF, two cases 
are considered: 
Case 1: PCF forms a formal concept. 
If no zero is found in the relation/matrix representing PCF, 
then, PCF is the optimal concept. So, the algorithm stops. 
Case 2: PCF is not a formal concept. 
If some zero entries are found in the relation/matrix 
representing PCF, we will look for more restraint pseudo­
concepts within the pseudo-concept PCF. 
So, we consider the pseudo-concepts containing the couples 
like (X, p) or (0, Y). These concepts contain, certainly, the 
couple (0, p). 
The considered heuristic is the optimal concept is certainly 
included in the optimal pseudo-concept. 
So, we should generate all possible rules from the pseudo­
concepts containing the couples like (X, p) or (0, Y). 
Then we compute the corresponding confidences and 
choose the maximum value between them. After that, we 
calculate the relevance value. Finally, we choose the 
pseUdo-concept having the greatest value of the Relevance 
function to be the new PCF. 
This heuristic procedure (of case 2) is repeated until PCF 
becomes a formal concept. To calculate the relevance of a 
pseUdo-concept, we introduce the general form of the 
previous function: 
Definition 10: Let PCFj = (Aj , Bj , Rj) be a pseudo-concept, 
where Rj is the restriction of the binary relation R, to the 
subsets Aj and Bj . We define the: 
Length of a pseudo-concept PCFj : the number of 
properties in Bj. 
Width of a pseudo-concept PCFj : the number of objects 
in Aj • 
Confidence of a pseudo-concept PCFj : is the maximum 
of confidence found when we generate the set of rules 
extracted from the pseUdo-concept PCFj . 
Size of a pseudo-concept PCFj: the number of couples 
(of values equal to 1) in the pseudo-concept. When PCFj is a 
formal concept, we have: 
Size(PCF)= (length(PCF) * width(PCF)) 
Relevance of a pseudo-concept is a function of the 
width, the length, the size and the confidence given by : 
Size(PCF) 
* Relevance(PCF)= 
flength(PCF)+ cOn{(PCF/ 
/ (length(PCF)+ width(PCF))- Size(PCF)/ 
B. Algorithmfor Optimal Coverage 
The problem of covering a binary relation by a set of 
optimal concepts is expressed through covering a binary 
matrix by a number of its complete sub-matrix. The latter is 
V2-522 
2010 International Coriference on Educational and Information Technology (ICEIT 2010) 
is a matrix having all its entries equal to '1 '. This problem, 
being NP-Complete problem, has been the subject of several 
previous works. However, we found out necessary the 
proposition of an approximate polynomial algorithm called 
Semantic Based on Formal Concept Analysis Approach 
SFC2A. 
Let R be the binary relation to cover. The proposed 
solution is to divide R into n packages (subsets): P], ... , Pn' 
Each package symbolizes one or more couples. 
The key idea of SFC2A algorithm is to build 
incrementally the optimal coverage of R: 
(i) The first step, covering the relation Rj =Pj by CVj• 
(ii) The ith step, let R i-I =P1 U ... U Pi-l and let CVi-1 be 
its optimal coverage. Building the optimal coverage CVi of 
Ri =Ri-l U Pi using the initial coverage CVi_1 and the 
package Pi. 
(iii) The nth step, finally, finding a set of concepts 
covering the relation R.

Example: Let R be the relation to cover as highlighted 
by table 1. R is partitioned into five packages: 
Pj={ol}x{A, B}, 
P2={02}x{A, B}, 
P3={03}x {B, C}, 
P4={04}x{B, C, D} and 
Ps={05}x{C, D}. 
Initially, R is an empty relation and in each step we add a 
package. 
Figure 3 presents the incrementation step when adding P4. 
In this step R3 encloses the four rows P], ... , P3. The 
initial optimal coverage CV3 encloses the formal concepts 
FC3=({01, 02}, {A, B}) and FC4=({03}, {B, C}). 
The package P4 encloses only three couples: (03,B), 
(03,C) and (03,D). 
The pseudo concept containing the couple (04, B) and 
(04,C) is : 
Case 1: the union of formal concepts ({03,04}, {B, C}) 
and ({04},D) 
Case 2: the formal concept ({ 04}, {B, C, D}). 
The computation of the relevance function induces to a 
negative value in the first case and positive value in the 
second case according to the following formula: 
Size(PCF) 
Relevance(PCF)= f J * length(PCF)+ con{(PCF) 
I (length(PCF)+ width(PCF)- Size(PCF)f 
Hence, the retained formal concept is FC6=({04}, {B, C, 
D}). 
Thus, the final coverage of R contains the concepts FC3, 
FC4 and FC6. Finally, according to our example, we find 
three Item-sets : {A, B}, {B, C} and {C, D}. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 
We carried out experiments on benchmark datasets, 
whose characteristics are summarized in table 3. 
Experiments were carried out on a Pentium IV PC with a 
CPU clock rate of 3.06 Ghz and a main memory of 512 MB.

To stress on the performance of our approach, we 
compare our proposal to the two pionnering methods in the 
same trend in the litterature namely the Apriori algorithm 
and IAR approach. The latter is also FCA based approach. 
To analyze the data, we choose the following values of 
parameters: MinSup=0.35 and MinConf=0.75.

Figure 4 sketches the runtime measured in seconds

algorithms keep the same behavior overall the data sets. 
The Apriori method takes the greater time, since it is based 
on an exhaustive approach to test all the possible 
combinations. Our method SFC2A outperforms the two 
algorithms IAR and Apriori thanks to its semantic selection 
of the frequent itemsets during the association rules 
extraction through the use of the relevance measure. 
VI. CONLUSION 
In this paper, we focused on extraction association rules 
based on formal concept analysis. In fact, we assume that an 
itemset is presented by the intent and the extent of a Formal 
Concept. Thus, we introduce a new approach SFC2A 
backboned on semantic relationship on the formal concept 
used for association rule extraction. The carried out 
experiments of our proposal showed the performance of our 
method compared to the pionnering approaches in the same 
trend. 
Future works will focus on: (1) the consideration of fuzzy 
context, (2) the study of the extraction of " generic 
association rules" inspired from our proposal.
