I INTRODUCTION 
With the network playing more and more important 
effect in the modern society, crimes using computer network 
are presenting the obvious trend of escalation. How to 
establish a safe and strong network system and guarantee the 
security of important information has already become 
research focus. Formerly, many ways used is the firewall 
policy, it might prevent from many kinds of attacks, such as 
using the protocol weakness, the source route, the address 
counterfeited, and so on, and provide safe data channel. But 
it could do nothing about the back door in application layer, 
the attack or stealing caused by authority exceeding of 
internal user and the information damaging. Moreover, 
because the firewall was at the network boundary, its own 
design flaws are inevitably exposed to attackers, firewall 
only is hard to resist the variety of attacks. Therefore, in 
order to guarantee the security of network system, one kind 
of technology that able to discover and report unauthorized 
or abnormal behavior was needed in the system, namely 
invasion detection system (IDS). In order to make IDS more 
efficiently and more fully and improve the efficiency and 
accuracy of intrusion detection, the data mining technology 
was introduced. 
II INTRUSION DETECTION TECHNOLOGY INTRODUCTION
Intrusion detection technology was divided into two 
categories: 
A Misuse Detection 
 Misuse Detection: Misuse Detection identify illegal 
invasion by the known attack methods and system 
vulnerabilities.. The main disadvantages of the methods is: 
because all known intrusion model have been implanted in 
the system, once any form of unknown intrusion appear, it 
cannot be detected. But detection efficiency of this method 
is high. 
B Anomaly Detection 
Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection identify illegal 
invasion or authority exceeding by checking whether the 
current user behavior has been deviated from normal 
behavior profile established. The advantage of this method is 
no needing on understanding the defect of system, good 
adaptability. But the possibility of error is high. 
The user behavior of intrusion detection system was 
showed by data form mainly. According to different sources 
of data, intrusion detection system can be divided into those

based on the host and those based on the network. The 
former’s data comes from the audit data of operating system 
and the latter’s data comes from packets through the 
network. Because the user's actions were showed by data, 
how to deal with the collected data correctly and effectively 
and draw conclusions are the core of problem. 
III THE DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY
A  Data mining 
Data Mining is to extract knowledge interested by people 
from large database or data warehouse, the knowledge is 
implied, unknown and potentially useful information. 
Extracted knowledge is represented as concept, rule, law and 
model. The purpose of data mining is to help the 
decision-maker to find potential association between data, 
found neglected elements which are perhaps very useful for 
trends and decision-making behavior. 
B Common data mining method and technology 
a) Correlation Analysis: correlation analysis was also 
called association rules, it is to find item set model 
knowledge frequently appeared from given data set, the 
purpose is to excavation the relationship that was hidden in 
data, for example, the customers that buy computer will buy 
some software, this is an association rules. 
b) Sequential patterns: it is similar with correlation 
analysis, the purpose is also to excavate connection that 
between data, however, time series analysis focused more on 
the relationship of data in times, for example, 80% people 
among printer buyer will buy printing paper after three 
months. 
c) Classification: classification is to find model or 
function that can describe the typical characteristics of data 
set, so that it can identify ownership or categories of 
unknown data. Typical classify models have the linear 
regression model, the decision tree model, the model based 
on rule and the neural network model. 
d) Clustering: Data was divided into a series of 
meaningful subset according to certain rules. In the same 
cluster, the gap between the individual is smaller, and in the 
different cluster, the gap is greater. 
e) Deviation analysis: to find abnormal data from the 
database. 
f)  Forecast: to find law according historical data, 
establish model, and to predict types, characteristics of the 
future data, etc based on the model. 
IV INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM BASED ON THE DATA 
MINING TECHNOLOGY
A. Implementation process 
The data mining technology was used in intrusion 
detection system, user’s behavior character was extracted 
and disciplinarian of intrusion behavior was summarized 
through the analysis for the historical data. Complete rules 
database established was used in intrusion detection. This 
process mainly divided into the following steps: 
 Data of test system that data collection based on 
network comes from network, the tools can be used 
have TCPDUMP etc. 
 Accuracy of that user’s characteristics was extracted 
and rules was deduced was affected directly by 
quality of training data of data preprocessing in data 
mining, if behavior of intrusion was included in data 
that be used to establish model where in intrusion 
system, then, latter detection system was established 
can not make any behavior for this intrusion 
behavior, so causing omission. Therefore , data that 
be used train must not contain any intrusion, and 
was formatted into the form that could be dealt with 
by data mining algorithm . 
 Data mining is the character or rules of user 
behavior was extracted from data was preteatmented, 
following to incorporate and update the rules that 
was gained, so the rules storeroom was established. 
 The behavior of current user was detected by rules 
in rules storeroom that intrusion detection based on, 
and different handle means was adopted according 
to the results of getting. 
B. Implementing case 
Intrusion detection system was constructed based on 
correlation analysis method of data mining, this system is 
mainly used for anomaly detection. Steps are as follows: 

a)  The data sources of this system is based on network, 
user’s data packet would be fetched through sniffer was 
emplaced in the network, then the protocol analysis method 
was introduced, the packet is discarded, the only header 
section was saved, data that was acquired after pretreatment 
according to specific methods include seven fields: time, 
source IP, the source port, purpose, the destination port, 
connect IP of ID, connection status. 
b)  Because of three times handshake process was 
included of the TCP connection establishment, so some 
connection that was established unsuccessfully was included 
in all training data was collected , it would produce negative 
impact for the process of data mining later, so should be 
removed, and only save those of data that can reflect normal 
network. There is not exist this problem for UDP, only each 
UDP packets was regarded as a connection. 
c)  APRIORI algorithm was used for data mining. 
APRIORI algorithm is used in the analysis of shopping 
basket; it was used to find rules about that the "90% of 
customer when purchase goods A and also can buy goods B". 
It was usually divided into two series: the form for output of 
rules is I1 & 12aI5 (support=2%, confidence=60%).  
d)  Before the network traffic data that was collected was 
formated the input formats of APRIORI algorithm, with 
connection ID instead of customer ID , other attributes 
alternative goods purchased.  After be given support and 
confidence, can get a set of rules: 192.168.0.50 & 
202.117.80.8 a80 (support=6?? confidence? 95? ) . 
Meaning of rules is that IP of the source and destination is 
respectively 192.168.0.50 and 202.117.80.8 port of purpose 
is 80, support of the rules is 6% and credibility is 95%. 
e)  Sampling of a period could not completely user 
behavior, so multiple sampling and repeat the process is 
necessary, then the merger method was used to incorporated 
rules set of many times get up until no longer generate new 
rules. The method was used and can extract more than 100 
rules (support 2%, credibility and found 85 percent) from the 
data of network flow (28.8M),but many of them was found 
meaningless obviously, it needs administrator to streamline 
through personal experience, finally get the rules that can be 
used to test. So far, the rules generated can describe fully 
behavior of users. The rules were used for intrusion 
detection. For example, one rule of the rule is 192.168.0.50 
& 202.117.80.8 a80 (support=6??confidence?95?), and 
in the process of test found source IP address connection in 
network data is 192.168.0.50 and purpose IP address is 
202.117.80.8, access ports is 1000, this was explained 
violation of the rules of low probability events occurred, 
suspicious degree of the connection is increase. In the actual 
process, abnormal connection from the same IP address may 
violate many rules, when the number of suspicious degrees 
more than a threshold the alarm is produced by system. 
Two groups of data were discussed for the system. One 
group is normal data that be known does not contain any 
attack (50M ,approximately 40 million record), this data was 
used for training system, and the introduced method above 
was adopted, in the confidence of setting that support is1% 
and credibility is 85% , the 17 inspection rules were got. 
Then the rules was used to detect another group data known 
containing attacks (54M, including 63 million records), the 
experimental results showed that the method can effectively 
detect PROBING attack. 
V CONCLUSION
With the rapid growth of the network bandwidth, means 
of hacker attacks have become increasingly diverse, existing 
intrusion detection system the reaction slower and less real 
time when network was intrusion. Therefore, how to 
instantly process the mass data in network and timely 
discover attack will become the next studying focus of 
intrusion detection system. The data mining technology was 
applied to the intrusion detection system, analysis based on 
historical data, the behavior of users was extracted, and the 
rule of intrusions behavior was summarized, more 
comprehensive knowledge base was established to intrusion 
detection. Experiments have proved that new attack type 
was detected effectively by intrusion detection system that 
data was data mining through APRIORI arithmetic, 
knowledge base was updated automatically, reliability of 
created rules is more high, so the efficiency and accuracy of 
the intrusion detection system was improved, and security of 
the network was enhanced.
