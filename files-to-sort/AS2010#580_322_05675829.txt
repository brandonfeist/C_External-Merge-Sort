Abstract—Information Retrieval (IR) technology helps people 
to search relevant and necessary documents from massive digital 
database.  In the context of e-law enforcement, it can be used to 
find verses related to a certain topic and presenting the 
relationship between one verse to the others. In this study we 
propose an intelligent searching system for Indonesian law 
documents which is enhanced by association analysis to discover 
the association of law related keywords, thus providing guidance 
for the user to find related verses.  
Keywords—association analysis, law documents, intelligent 
searching, information retrieval 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Information Retrieval technology helps people to find 
relevant and necessary documents from massive digital 
database. Once a document has been digitalized, it becomes 
easy for users to find relevant information from the database. 
Google.com, yahoo.com are examples of such service which 
have a great contribution to provide online information quickly 
and accurately to the internet users.  
Various datamining algorithms are incorporated, since they 
are capable to discover knowledge from the database which can 
be used to increase the searching performance. One of such 
techniques is Association Analysis. Examples of its application 
are found in the field of webmining[1], document analysis[2], 
and bioinformatics[3].   
In this study, we developed “Telusur Hukum”, an 
information retrieval system to help people finding Indonesian 
law documents and verses related to a certain topics and show 
the association between one verses to the others. The 
association among the verses were discovered using Apriori 
algorithm in Association Analysis[4].   
The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Sec.2 
described the “Telusur Hukum” system, Sec.3 described the 
application of Association Analysis to discover the associations 
between keywords in law documents, Sec.4 reported the 
experimental results which will be summarized and concluded 
in Sec.5.   
II. TELUSUR HUKUM 
“Telusur Hukum”, an information retrieval system to help 
people finding Indonesian government law documents. The 
complete system would have a database contain the law 
documents, Indonesian language WordNet, a set of applications 
for searching keywords (law cases), viewing the clusers of the 
documents, and visualizing the searching results in a concise 
and easy to understand manner.  Currently, the database 
contains more than 2100 verses from 28 law and ordinance 
documents. This system can be accessed from 
http://www.inn.bppt.go.id/TelusurHukum/index.php 
This paper reported the efforts to enhance the searching 
system by providing related keywords which were discovered 
using association analysis.  
III. MINING THE LAW DOCUMENTS USING 
ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS 
Intelligent Searching system aims to help user not only  
finding documents that match to a specific query, but also 
providing candidates or documents which are considered 
closely related to the query of interest.  To develop an 
intelligent searching system,various datamining techniques are 
implemented to reveal the knowledge inside the database.  
Various algorithms are evaluated to enhance the searching 
capability of “Telusur Hukum”, including Association 
Analysis, Clustering on topological visualization  based on 
Kohonen’s Self Organizing Maps. This focus of this paper 
reported the evaluation of Association Analysis implemented 
in Telusur Hukum.  
Figure 1 shows the overview of the proposed Association 
Analysis based intelligent searching system. Due to the 
unstructure characteristics of law documents, it is necessary to 
proceed the data by converting them into vectoral 
representation, thus ready to be processed by Association 
Analysis. It consists of tokenization, stop word removal, text to 
vector conversion, association analysis using Apriori algorithm, 
then association rules interpretation. In the tokenization phase, 
the sentences will be broken into words (tokens), using tab and

Figure 1.  Overview of the system 
characters spaces as delimiters.  A list of Indonesian stop words 
are used to remove those words from the documents to increase 
the search performance. One critical step in this study is 
choosing the appropriate vector representation of the verses.  A 
verse or document can be represented using in various levels: 
sub-word level, word-level, multi-word level, semantic level 
and pragmatic level. We chose word-level representation due to 
its simplicity. The attribute of the vector could be binary, raw 
term frequency, verses, document frequency, or their 
combination. The current system adopted the binary 
representation, by assigning “1” if a word found in a verses, 
and “0” otherwise  [5]. After converting the verses of law 
documents into  vector representation, the associations of the 
keywords are extracted using Association Rules. 
Association rules are formally expressed as YX ? , where 
X and Y are disjoint itemsets. In the experiments, the itemsets 
are the keywords found in the law documents. The strength of 
the rule is measured in terms of support s  and  confidence c. 
They are formally defined as follows: 
Support, 
N
YX
YXs
)(
)(

?
;   (1) 
Confidence, 
)(
)(
)(
X
YX
YXc
?
? ?
=? .  (2) 
Support s is a metric that shows how often a rule is 
applicable to a given dataset, while confidence c shows how 
frequently keyword in Y appear in the verses contain keyword  
X. 
Thus, the aim of this step is to extract rules from the 
database, i.e. “if  keyword-1 found in a verse, keyword-2 will 
found in the same verse with support s and confidence c”. 
These rules will help user to find verses related to a topic by 
providing several combinations keywords (keyword-1 and 
keyword-2) of which their associations have been discovered 
from the database at certain values of support s and confidence 
c. 
Association Analysis basically consists of two major subtasks: 
1. Frequent Itemset Generation,  to find all itemsets 
(keywords) that satisfy a minimum threshold 
2. Rule Generation, to extract all high confidence rules 
from the frequent itemsets. 
 
Frequent itemset generation is implemented using Apriori 
Algorithm [4][6]. Apriori used support-based pruning to 
systematically control the exponential growth of the candidate 
itemsets. Let Ck  denotes the set of the candidate k-itemsets and 
Fk  denotes the set of frequent k-itemsets: 
1. The algorithm determines the support of each item (in 
this case : keyword), thus the set of all frequent 1-
itemsets are obtained (F1) 
2. Generate new candidate k-itemsets using the frequent 
(k-1) itemsets found in the previous iteration 
3. Count the support of the candidates 
4. Eliminates all candidate itemsets whose support count 
are less than minsup (minimum support threshold) 
5. The algorithm terminates when there are no new 
frequent itemset generated. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Experiments were conducted using law documents which 
were obtained from Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human 
Rights [7]. All the documents are written in Indonesian. We 
used 300 verses of Indonesian government (Specifically, they 
consists of “Undang-undang”, “Peraturan Pemerintah”, 
“Keputusan Presiden”, “Peraturan Presiden”, “Undang-undang 
Darurat Republik Indonesia”, “Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti 
Undang-Undang” and “Penetapan Presiden”). The data were 
preprocessed by tokenization, stop word removal and vector 
conversion as depicted in Fig.2. Stopword list consists of 330 
words, such as “jika”, “dan”, “yang”, “namun”. The 
experiments were conducted using computer and software with 
configuration as follows: Pentium IV, 2GB RAM, Windows 
Vista, WEKA version 3.4.13 [8]. 
To convert each verse of the documents into vector 
representation, we monitored the presence of a word in a verse 
instead of measuring it frequency, thus yielded  binary 
representation. A value of 1 indicated that a certain keyword 
existed in the verse, while 0 indicated the absence of the 
keyword. A list of 125 keywords were generated manually 
which were considered to have important meaning. After 
recorded the presence/absence of these words, a verse was 
converted into 123-dimensional binary vector representation.  
The database was then processed using Association analysis. 
The possible rules extracted from the dataset with d=123 
keywords (itemset) is around 591085.4 × possible rules. 
Association analysis was applied to prune the rules, extracting 
only interesting ones from the database. The first step is 
Frequent Itemset Generation. A set of keyword combinations 
were extracted by Apriori Algorithm as frequent itemsets at 
various minimum support (s) minsup.

The second step is Rule Generation, aims to extract all high 
confidence rules from the frequent itemsets. Figure 2 depicted 
the number of association rules extracted at minsup 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 
and minconf 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0. 
Based on the result, we chose minsup=0.1 and minconf=0.9, 
to obtain a sufficient number of rules with high level 
confidence. This combination of thresholds generated 58 
association rules. Table 1 shows part of the rules obtained in 
the experiments.  
The first rule of Tab.1 (No.1) shows that from 300 verses 
there are around 60 verses that have keyword pendaftaran 
(registration) since the support s is 0.2.  Confidence level of 
this rule c=1.0 means that all of the 60 verses contain keyword 
penduduk (population).  This rule is one of strongest found in 
this experiment. The higher value of support s indicated the 
higher importance of the rules, while the higher value of 
confidence c indicated  the higher reliability of the rules. The 
second rule (No.2) shows an example of rule which associated 
two keywords (instansi and pendaftaran) and one keyword 
penduduk. Although the rule has high confidence level (c=1.0) 
it has lower support compared to the first rule at s=0.1, thus the 
association rule is found in only 10 verses. The rest of the 
examples shows the rules obtained in various support s and 
confidence c. 
Using the result of the experiments, the Telusur Hukum 
will assist user by providing associated keywords as guidance 
to enhance the searching.  For example, if a user wrote 
“pendaftaran” as searching query to Telusur Hukum, the 
system will response by providing  associated keywords 
information e.g. “pendaftaran” is associated with “penduduk” 
at s=0.2 and c=0.1 and give the links to the related verses. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This study aims to implementing Association Analysis to 
discover association rules among verses of Indonesian 
Government Law Documents.  The extracted rules are used to 
enhance the searching function of “Telusur Hukum”, an 
intelligent searching system for Law Documents.

When a searching query is inputed to the system, it will provide 
associated keywords information and their links which will 
help the users to find related verses. Experiments were 
conducted using 300 verses and the top 58 rules were obtained 
at minimum support threshold minsup 0.1 and minimum 
confidence minconf =0.9. The rules helped users to find verses 
that have the associated keywords.  The future works of this 
study includes conducting experiments with larger scale 
database, integrating the system with verses clustering based on 
Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps, and development of 
Indonesian WordNet.
