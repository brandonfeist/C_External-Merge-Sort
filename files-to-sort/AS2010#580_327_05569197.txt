Abstract—Association rules mining is a popular and well 
researched method in data mining research field , its purpose is 
to mine interesting relations between attributes in transaction 
database. Classic Apriori algorithm is one of the most influential 
association rules in mining boolean frequent itemsets algorithms, 
However, it has some disadvantages such as inefficient in 
generating candidate itemsets and frequently scanning database, 
it is not suitable for mining multiple dimensional data model 
which rise in recent years. A "second cut" method is proposed, 
which is on the basis of the Apriori algorithm. The algorithm 
applies to multidimensional mining association rules, and to some 
extent improved the efficiency of the algorithm. Referring to the 
manufacturing resource planning system (MRP) features of the 
retail points, the article sets up the sales association analysis data 
model based on the above algorithm. It proves that it can 
increase the sales dramatically by applying this methodology to 
the real business environment.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Due to the improvement of data collection capacity, lower 
cost of data storage, and development of database and data 
warehouse technology, the past decades have witnessed a rapid 
growth of Internet and e-commerce applications, along with a 
massive accumulation of data. "Data explosion" began to be a 
serious concern in business, government and scientific 
domains. In the mean time, enterprises are increasingly facing 
tougher competition and more challenges in a more complex 
and sensitive marketplace. Therefore, timely access to relevant 
information and effective discovery of useful knowledge in 
business decision-making has become a critical issue in 
enhancing core competence and sustainability. In this paper, 
manufacturing resource planning system is incepted as a 
process to discover hidden, novel and potentially useful and 
understandable knowledge for supporting business operations 
and management decisions. The core technology of 
manufacturing resource planning system is data mining. 
Nowadays, manufacturing resource planning system research 
and applications have been focal points of many fields such as 
business, information technology, engineering etc., for both 
academia and industries.  
In this paper, described is the implementation of a 
multidimensional association algorithm, Further, we use this 
implementation to generate interesting multidimensional 
association rules using data that represents papers. This paper is 
aimed at exploring approaches to discovering a type of 
important knowledge, namely, association rules, with major 
contributions in enriching knowledge representation and 
semantics, improving mining efficiency, and extending 
application domains, which are deemed novel and meaningful.. 
II. ASSOCIATION RULES 
Association rule mining is one of the best studied models 
for data mining. In recent years, the discovery of association 
rules from databases is an important and highly active research 
topic in the data mining field. Association rule mining searches 
for interesting association or correlation relationships among 
items in a given dataset. 
Association rules provide a means for representing 
dependencies between attribute values of data records stored in 
a database. Typically, Let I = { I1, I2,..., Im } be a set of items, 
and T a set of transactions, each a subset of I. An association 
rule is an implication of the form A=>B, where A and B are 
non-intersecting The support of A=>B is the percentage of the 
transactions that contain both A and B. The confidence of 
A=>B is the percentage of transactions containing A that also 
contain B (interpret as P(B|A)). The occurrence frequency of an 
item set is the number of transactions that contain the item set. 
Association rules of such type are often employed in the 
context of market basket analysis, where an object is a 
purchase and features are associated with products or items.  
A. Basic concepts 
R. Agrawal et al [1] proposed the first association rule 
mining algorithm in 1993 to discover patterns in transactional 
databases from the retail industry and business. The idea to 
discover association rules is also named “market basket 
analysis” because it looks for associations among items that a 
customer purchases in a retail shop. For example, when a 
customer buys item A, there is 90% probability he or she will 
also buy item B.

With a transaction database D = {T1, T2, ...,Tn }where each 
Ti (1 ? i ? n) represents a transaction and a set of items I = { 
I1, I2,..., Im} where each Ij (1 ? j ? m) represents one kind of 
item, each transaction Ti records the items purchased by the 
corresponding customer, i.e., Ti ?I An association rule on this 
database is formatted as X ?Y , where X and Y are called 
itemsets, which are non-empty subsets of I, X and Y are 
disjoint. Two metrics are usually used to measure the reliability 
and accuracy of the mined association rule:  
• the support s of  the rule is the prior probability of X 
and Y,  
  
 tuplesofnumber  total
Y and Xboth  containing  tuplesofnumber   )sup( ===
n
YX
YXs
??  (1) 
• the confidence c of the rule is the conditional 
probability of Y given X,  
X containing  tuplesofnumber 
Y and Xboth  containing  tuplesofnumber 
)sup(
)sup(
=
?
=
?
=
X
YX
X
YXc   (2) 
Intuitively, s can be viewed as the occurrence frequency of 
X in the whole transaction database D, while c indicates that 
when X is true, Y is also true with probability of c. 
Two thresholds, minimum confidence and minimum 
support, are used by the mining algorithm to find all 
association rules whose support and confidence are above the 
corresponding thresholds. 
B. The Apriori Algorithm  
Usually, an association rule mining algorithm consists of 
two steps[2,6]: 
1)Finding the frequent itemsets which have support above 
the predetermined minimum support min_sup. 
2) Use the frequent itemsets to generate (strong) association 
rules that satisfy the minimum support min_sup and minimum 
confidence min_conf. 
The Apriori algorithm pseudo-code: 
L1 = {large1-itemsets}; 
For (k=2; Lk-1?n; k++) do 
{ 
     Ck = apriori_gen(Lk-1);    
For all transactions tD  do 
     { 
         Ct = subset(Ck,t);  
          For all candidates cCt do 
          c.count++; 
     } 
     Lk = { cCk| c.count?min_sup } 
} 
Answer = kLk; 
 
Function apriori_gen( Lk-1,min_sup ) 
Ck = NULL; 
For each itemset liLk-1 
For each itemset ljLk-1 
    If (li[1]=lj[1])(li[2]=lj[2]) …(li[k-2]=lj[k-2])(li[k-
1]=lj[k-1])?min_sup  then 
        {  
           c = li  join  lj; 
           if has_infrequent_subset ( c,Lk-1) 
           delete  c; 
           else add c to Ck; 
        } 
Return Ck; 
 
Function has_infrequent_subset( c,Lk-1) 
For each (k-1)-subset s of c 
     If  s?Lk-1 then 
        Return TURE; 
Return FALSE; 
An example of the dataset preprocessing is given in the table 
1.

2 b,c,e 
3 a,b,c,e 
4 b,e 
 
If min_sup =2,then candidate generation : C3={b,c,e} 
III. MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSOCIATION RULES 
The scope of most of our studies has been confined to 
mining single dimensional association rules, where each rule  
involves a  single distinct predicate with multiple occurrences. 
A typical such example is to find association rules like (3) 
among a large set of  a large set of transactions. 
)"",()"",(, mousexbuyskeyboardxbuysntransactiox ???     (3) 
Where x is a variable representing a transaction, buys(x,y) 
is a predicate which represents the purchase of item y in 
transaction x.  
                                                                                                                                          1435
In manufacturing resource planning system, we would also 
like to mine association rules containing multiple predicates  
For example, one may like to find rules containing multiple 
predicates, such as (4):  
)"80",(
)"",(   )35"-"30age(X,Person  x
uanthoursandypriceofcarXbuys

????
    (4) 
or even rules containing multiple predicates with multiple 
occurrences. 
Following the terminology popularly used in 
multidimensional databases, we refer to each distinct predicate 
in a rule as a dimension. An association rule is called a single 
dimensional association rule if it involves only one distinct 
predicate  and a rule is called a multidimensional association 
rule if it involves more than one distinct predicate. Moreover, a 
rule containing a predicate with multiple occurrences is called a 
rule with repetitive predicate. For example, rule (3) is a single 
dimensional association rule with repetitive predicate  rule (4) 
is a multidimensional association rule. 
A.  Data Cube  
The database to be examined in our study is a relational 
database rather than a transaction database. We believe that the 
latter forms a typical model for mining single dimensional 
association rules;[7,16]  whereas the former provides a typical 
model for mining multidimensional association rules. This is 
based on the following observation. A transaction database 
usually consists of a large set of transactions in the form of  
“transaction_id: {set_of_items_purchased}”,and the rules to be 
mined are naturally related to one distinct predicate, such as 
buy(x, y)(as in (3)), where x is a transaction or customer 
identifier and y is an item purchased, which are single 
dimensional association rules, On the other hand, a relational 
database represents the relationships among multiple attributes 
and/or relations ,and the rules to be mined are naturally 
associated with multiple dimensions . Similarly, data 
warehouses, object-relational databases, object-oriented 
databases, etc. they are constructed based on relationships 
among multiple dimensions, attributes, and/or relations , and 
mining multidimensional associations is expected to have wide 
applications  in manufacturing resource planning system. 
In a large relational database, a data mining task is often 
relevant to only a subset of the data stored. Thus, a data mining 
task often contains a relational query portion which is first 
evaluated to collect the set of data relevant to the task. This set 
of collected data is called the initial relation of the mining task. 
Mining association rules can be performed on a relation D 
in a similar fashion as that in transaction databases. However, 
we argue that it is advantageous to adopt a data cube structure 
for efficient mining of multidimensional association rules. 
An n-dimensional data cube is an n-dimensional database, 
in which each dimension represents an attribute, and each cube 
data cell registers the number of tuples which match the 
corresponding n-dimensional attribute values .In our cube 
structure,  a special sum cell is added in each dimension. That 
is, if there are ai distinct attribute values in the i-th dimension, 
the(ai+1)-st row represents sum, i.e., each cell in this row stores 
the sum of the cell values of all the previous rows in the 
corresponding column. 
 
B. Multidimension Association Rules Algorithm 
• Firstly, handle numerical attributes: static discretization. 
For example : there are four dimension(A,B,C,D) in the 
database. The static discrete result is given in the table 2. 
TABLE II.  STATIC DISCRETE RESULT 
A B C D 
a1 b1 c1 d1 
a2 b2 c2 d2 
From the results as performed by Apriori algorithm, the sets 
of frequent 2-itemsets and 3-itemsets are given in Table 3 and 4, 
respectively, suppose that all the frequent itemsets with 
minimum support min-sup and min-conf. 
TABLE III.  2-ITEMSETS 
{a1,b1} {a1,b2} {a2,b1} 
{a2,b2} {a1,c1} {a1,c2} 
{a2,c1} {a2,c2} {b1,c1} 
{b1,c2} {b2,c1} {b2,c2} 
{a1,d1} {a1,d2} {a2,d1} 
{a2,d2} {b1,d1} {b1,d2} 
{b2,d1} {b2,d2} {c1,d1} 
{c1,d2} {c2,d1} {c2,d2} 
TABLE IV.  3-ITEMSETS 
{a1, b1,c1 } {a2,b2,d1} 
{a1,b1,c2} {a2,b2,d2} 
{a1,b2,c1} {a1,c1,d1} 
{a1,b2,c2} {a1,c1,d2} 
{a2,b1,c1} {a1,c2,d2} 
{a2,b2,c2} {b1,c1,d1} 
{a2,b1,c2} {b1,c1,d2} 
{a2,b2,c1} {b2,c2,d1} 
{a1,b1,d1} {b2,c2,d2} 
{a1,b1,d2} {a1,b2,d2} 
{a1,b2,d1} {a2,b1,d2} 
 
When generates 4-itemsets, it can appear this items of 
{a1,b1,c1,c2},in this itemsets, two items of c1 and c2 appear 
with the same dimension, obviously this is wrong. We can 
apply the first cut in order to delete the itemsets which include 
two items of the same dimension, so it will not appear this kind 
items of {a1,b1,c1,c2}. 
• Generation of frequent itemsets 
Performed on the data cube data mining association rules is 
different from the previous section procedure based on classic 
Apriori algorithm. It consists of three steps: generate data cube, 
generate frequent itemsets and generate association rules. The 
procedure of look for the frequent itemsets consists of two step: 
join and cut, the cut procedure is the second one. 
• The improved algorithm pseudo-code 
                                                                                                                                          1436
