Abstract-A knowledge map is a vital tool for better 
knowledge management. While application of searching the 
content which user concerned in the website remains in the 
initial stages of development, website content management is 
a process of knowledge management and therefore suited to 
knowledge maps. This paper presents a knowledge map for 
the intelligentized content website. And in this work it 
constructs the architecture of the knowledge map system 
that is made by six modules according to the principle of 
high cohesion and low coupling. Then it utilizes association 
rules and pruning algorithm to achieve the core module of 
system. And the results from it are used to generating 
knowledge map. This map representation compensates for 
the lack of various meanings in a single knowledge map. For 
novices interested in searching website knowledge content, 
results of the present study provide constructive information 
to know their concerned content in the website. In summary, 
this paper presents a suitable procedure for extracting 
knowledge from website knowledge content sources for 
development of a knowledge map. The proposed approach 
can be used for rapid generation of knowledge maps.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The theory of the article derived from the use of the 
content management website. Everyone would defme 
some category which according to their own habits or 
intellectual levels, and then they will submit some essay 
into the websites. Those creators will fmd that they can 
find the articles in need instantly in the beginning. 
However, as the time goes on, the content are becoming 
much more than before so that they would be not easily to 
fmd. Meanwhile, to different readers, the same article will 
belong to different category. Towards a new member, he 
wants to find the content that he pays attention to, but it is 
actually more complex than he think. Managing content in 
the website is a process of knowledge management. 
Therefore, there is a strongly desire of constructing such 
auxiliary tool to help manage knowledge content [1]. And 
knowledge map is considered an effective tool for it [2].

II. THE DEFINITION AND FUNCTION OF KNOWLEDGE 
MAp 
A. The Definition of Knowledge Map 
The knowledge map originated from the geographical 
map. Initially, the knowledge map of American Express is 
an American geographical map which is full of knowledge. 
It's not only a file and a table with index number or 
hierarchical relationships, but also a table of information 
resource management and a graph of information resource 
distribution [3]. This is the early form of the knowledge 
map. And this form lays particular emphasis on the 
description of the relationship between information 
resource and relevant departments. But the relations 
between information resource items are not involved. 
According to the definition given by Gartner Group, [4] 
the knowledge map works to descript a group of concept 
and their incidence relation. Users can fmd the concepts in 
need quickly. Moreover, they can find the interrelated 
knowledge resources' hyperlink either. 
You can give knowledge map such defmition in the 
knowledge management area [5]: It is the general list of 
catalogs; it can be a knowledge management instrument. 
And then, scattered thoughts can be summarized and easily 
administrated. People can access, share and recycle the 
knowledge with knowledge map. Apart from this, it also 
provides the users' location when users are researching in 
the sea of knowledge and show them how to search 
information accurately and efficiently [6]. 
B. The Function and Application of Knowledge Map 
On the whole, knowledge map is the basis of 
expressing knowledge. For the purpose specified in the 
definition of "share information", it used unified concepts 
to achieve such goal. And such measures illustrate its great 
superiority in the communication, interoperability, systems 
engineering and knowledge management [7]. 
At present, the reference for knowledge map is as 
follows: Knowledge Retrieval [8], information integration 
[9] and knowledge acquisition [10]. 
The main function of the knowledge map is to achieve 
knowledge sharing and reusing. And that makes computers 
formulate a better understanding about the information and 
languages. Therefore, knowledge map has outstanding 
CMCE 2010 
application prospect in the information interoperate and 
knowledge understanding. 
III. ARCHITECTURE OF KNOWLEDGE MAP 
The target of this system's overall design is to achieve 
a knowledge map that with extensible characteristic and 
portability. The system can be cross-platform and because 
of that it is able to integrate with different web sites. And 
this paper will focus on constructing knowledge map of 
intelligentized content website. The general architecture of 
this system, which is made by six parts, is given in Figure 
1. The six parts are stated below: Data Acquisition Module, 
Pretreatment Module, Segmentation Module, Ontology 
Product Module, Classification Module and Knowledge 
Map Generating Module. 
Data Acquisition Module is in charge of 
communicating with the website and it is the role of bridge 
in the knowledge map which provides essential data. 
Pretreatment Module is responsible for documentation. Its 
main aims are participle, removing useless words, and 
counting the word frequency. The system integrates Data 
Acquisition Module with Pretreatment Module so that they 
can work on the data acquisition and preprocessing 
together. Segmentation Module's main task is processing 
Chinese text segmentation for HTML Web page. Ontology 
Product Module provides a platform that experts could 
defme ontology and its relations. Moreover, it provide the 
basis that how to classify for Classification Module. 
Classification Module's main responsibility is classifying 
pretreated documents on the basis of the ontology concept 
that given by domain experts. And classification of 
features can be extracted either. The results are the 
foundation of the Knowledge Map Generating Module. 
According to consumers' demands, Knowledge Map 
Generating Module would generate knowledge map and 
display it. 
The design pattern of each module is based on such 
principle: high cohesion and low coupling. If a module is 
highly reusable, it would be designed to be independent. 
And the modules' reusability can be increased by this 
approach. Each module has independent existence and can 
be developed all alone. The advantage this design pattern 
bring us is that we can update the specifically module 
along with developing modem technology without 
changing others.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM OF THE MAIN 
MODULES IN THE SYSTEM 
Classification Module and Knowledge Map Generating 
Module are the main modules of this system. And the 
following are their implementation. 
A. Concrete Realization of the Classification Module 
As the core module of the system, Classification 
Module was divided into two modules during the 
implementation process: association rules generation 
module and classification module. 
• The Realization of Association Rules Generation 
Module 
Association rules generation module mines out the text 
association rules of the classification from the set of words 
after pretreatment. However, because it still exists noise 
data after pretreatment in the set of words, it can generate 
noise text association rules and lead to adverse effect for 
the classification accuracy of the classification module. 
This module also carries out the pruning of text association 
rules. Therefore, this module is divided into two parts to 
achieve, association rules mining and using the generated 
association rules for pruning. 
1. The Generation Algorithm for Web Document 
Classification Association Rules [11] 
Input: As Di : {Ci'tj,t2 ...... ,tm} of a series of document set 
D , where Ci is the class label of Dj, t j is the term 
extracting from the document. Minimum confidence 
threshold, minimum support threshold (J" • 
Output: As tl/\t2/\t3, ... ,/\tn=>Ci of a series of 
association rules set R ( multidimensional 
association rules), where Ci is the of 
classification Category, t. is a term. } 
The algorithm is listed as follows: 
1) C1 +- { Candidate I term-sets and their support} 
2) Fl +- { Frequent 1 term-sets and their support} 
3) for (i +- 2 ; F';-l * <1>; i +-i-I) { 
4) Ci +- (Fi_1ooFi_1) 
5) Ci +-Ci -{ c I ( i  -1) item-set of c ? Fi-1 } 
6) Dj +- filterTable (Dj_1, Fj_1) 
7) froeach document d in Dj do{ 
8) foreach c in Ci { 
9) c.support+- c.support + Count( c, d) 
10) } 
} 
Fl +-{ C E Cj I c.support> (J" } 
} 
Sets +-Uj{ CECi li> l} 
R=<I> 
11) 
12) 
13) 
14) 
15) 
16) 
17) 
18) } 
foreach itemset I in Sets do{ 
R +- R + { l  => Cat} 
In Step 6), the purpose of executing the function 
filterTable( Di-1, F';-l) during each iteration is reducing 
the space occupied by the document through releasing the 
transaction excluding item sets. 
2. Pruning Algorithm for Association Rules 
Input: Association rules set(S) and training text set(D) 
during the period of mining association rules. 
Output: The rules set used for classification. 
The algorithm is listed as follows: 
1) R = sort (R); 
2) R '= fmdMoreSpecific(R); 
3) R" = prune(R'); 
4) foreach r in R " { 
5) D '= findTransaction(r); 
6) if (D'.sizeO >= 1){ 
7) choose r; 
8) } 
9) removeTransaction(r); 
10) } 
• The Realization of Classification Module 
The module uses the dominant factor algorithm to 
solve the problem that one new document belongs to 
multiple categories. The dominant factor t5 is a part of 
most types of rules in the process of classifYing an 
document using rules. Only to meet the rule of the 
dominant factor t5 threshold is meaningful rules. 
Algorithm of New Document Classification [11]: 
Input:The term which created by new document to be 
classified n; The association rules term which is 
composed by the association rules generated from 
ARC v; Dominant factor t5 ; Confidence threshold 
(J'. 
Output:The list of the classification 
classList. 
The algorithm is listed as follows: 
1) S?<l> 
2) R = fmdRules(n, v); 
3) sorteR); 
4) foreach rule r in R { 
5) if ( r.conf> (J') { 
6) count++; 
7) S?Sur 
8) 
9) 
10) 
11) 
} 
groupRuleByClass(S); 
foreach Si in Sl>S2,S3,,,,,Sn { 
of the document 
12) 
13) 
14) 
15) 
16) 
Si .sumConfidence = sumRuleConfidience( Si ); 
Si .countRule = countRule( Sj ); 
} 
if (classifiyType = = II single "){ 
className = 
maxSumConfidence( Sj, S2, S3 , ... , Sn); 
if(className = = null){ 17) 
18) 
19) 
20) 
21) 
22) 
23) } 
className = maxRule(Sj,S2,S3,,,,,Sn); 
} 
classList.add( className); 
} else { 
classList = takeKClasses( S , t5); 
In the process for implementation, the function 
fmdRules(n, v) obtained the rules set R by scanning the 
database in step 2). In step 22) the function 
takeKClasses( S , t5) assigned the categories whose rules 
total can meet the dominant factor included by S to the 
document, that is, assigned the categories of Si .countRule 
408 
>= t5 to the document. At this point the document can also 
attributable to a number of categories. 
B. Concrete Realization of the Knowledge Map 
Generating Module 
According to the aim of the system, knowledge map 
uses the way of thinking management to show to the users 
ultimately. That is, the tree of knowledge shows the 
distribution of knowledge by the way of human's thinking. 
Users fmd the concrete knowledge through traversing 
every layer and get other knowledge which is related to 
this in order to facilitating the user to understand 
knowledge distribution and content [12]. 
There are two kinds of knowledge map presentation 
method in the realization of this module, by sort or by 
document. And this paper presents the former. 
It's simple to present knowledge map when there is no 
request. It only need present all sort in the form of ladder 
and label the characteristic word of the sort. 
Algorithm of knowledge map presentation: 
Input: Viewing the request of knowledge map. 
Output: The structure of knowledge maps. 
The algorithm is listed as follows: 
1) T = generateTreeO; 
2) foreach node in T{ 
3) node.characterWords = findCharacterWords(node); 
4) node.rules = fmdRules(node); 
5) } 
6) writeToXML(file); 
7) readToPage(file); 
Writing the generated knowledge tree to .xml file in 
order to generating knowledge tree of variable levels 
dynamically. In step 5) and step 6), present the generated 
knowledge tree onto the interface if the tree-level is pre­
defmed fixed value. The aim of writing the generated 
knowledge tree to .xml file is reducing the number of 
visiting database and improving the efficiency of system. 
That is, the knowledge tree is not re-generated from the 
database when the knowledge map is used by other users. 
But the algorithm is re-implemented when a new sort or a 
new document is generated. 
V. TESTING AND PROTOTYPE DISPLAY 
The testing data comes from the Confluence content 
management system including the resources of Data 
Structures and Algorithm Design. Testing results is given 
in Figure 2. , that includes (a) and (b). And (a) shows the 
index of knowledge map, (b) shows knowledge map 
presentation by sort. 
The figures above reveal that the aim of system has 
already implemented. 
This knowledge map has no applicability for onefold 
website from the experimental process because of the 
particle size of sort. The thinner particle size of sort can 
lead to bigger cross of sort and not to get better 
classification. And the thicker ones may bring more 
contents when users are searching and not easy to see. The 
particle size has no unique standard and it is adjusted based 
on the data during the experimental process. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
The ultimate goal of knowledge map is to guide users 
to view the content of their concerns and help them fmd 
the desultory knowledge in the website. This article 
designs in detail and chooses the algorithms for the core 
modules to refme the overall structure, and ultimately 
implements knowledge map. Of course, there should be 
possible to continue to dig out deeply according to the 
research of paper. Firstly, the system may be added 
permission control module to manage the permission of 
ontology concept. Secondly, we can add search function 
for the knowledge map and combine knowledge map with 
search engines. And we may get the better improvement 
through some experimental results. These are to be further 
researched and improved.
