Abstract 
 
In recent years, many network users has been the 
serious impact by the intrusion of the Internet, there are many 
attack events occur at the present time. On the Internet, the 
intruders usually launch attacks from the stepping stone that 
they previously compromised. In this way, the attackers can 
reduce their risk of directly detected. Even if the network 
managers detect the invasion that still can’t identify the true 
attack intruders IP location through the observation records. 
And there are many network attacks using a large amount of 
stepping stone to launch a joint flooding attack at the same 
time. The victim computer or web site will not bear this kind 
large flood traffic that make the servers cannot work properly 
to provide normal Internet services. The problem of stepping 
stone has being caused serious impact on network security. 
In this study, we use the association rules mining technique to 
establish an automatically stepping stone detection module. By 
collect the connecting records in the local network to gather 
the information of source and destination IP addresses in the 
same period. The traffic data analyse by association rule 
algorithms trying to figure out the transmission characteristics 
of the stepping stone. By identifying the suspicious IP 
addresses of stepping stone will be helpful for the network 
security administrators to improve the security of network.

1. Introduction 
 
With the Internet technology, the Internet existed for 
many kinds of network security threats, causing a lot of 
serious losses. In particular, the problem of stepping stone 
has caused a serious security threat, the seriousness situation 
of the stepping stone even more than the threat of general 
computer viruses. In generally, attacker will use the stepping 
stone to hide the real location. Attackers do not use the direct 
access to intrude into the victim computer, that is too danger 
for the attacker. They use stepping stone to launch any kind 
network attacks. Even if the stepping stone be discovered by 
the network managers, they only could trace back to the 
stepping stone location. For the more, there are many 
Internet attackers will jump several stepping stones for 
protecting themselves, so the network administrator just can 
detect the stepping stone IP address that is the most near to 
the victim location. The subnet of the stepping stone is often 
not in same network area of victim’s host in. If the 
administrator of victim’s network area wants to trace back to 
find out this is attacker address, administrator need 
coordination of other network manager in real time. The 
managers of different inter-domain network communication 
are often requiring strenuous effort and wasting a lot of time, 
that causes many stepping stone become difficulties in 
tracing the intrusion path. That propose internet attackers 
have a good chance to disguise the original location of the 
attacking host. 
Especially in the modern Internet environment, the 
Internet connection is easy to be cross-regional or cross-
country. The intruders who attack in the network are often 
using the stepping stone as transnational site. In particular, 
they will use the stepping stone which is not in their own 
countries. It’s the way to escape their country's laws and 
regulations. On the another hand, the host who was been 
attack found that the attacks of the stepping stone is in 
foreign countries will have to cross countries and there is no 
way to deal with the next step of action. In recent years, 
many attacks are international distributed denial-of-
service attack (DDoS attack). Network attacks from different 
places of the world at the same time that makes the victim 
website managers are difficultly to prevent these kind attacks.  
Intruders often search the computer that be lacking in 
security management in Internet, and the computer be the 
stepping stone after the invasion. In most of the time, this 
kind of the hiding stepping stone is potential and not easily 
to be detected. Unlike other obvious attack such as worms or 
replacement pages would be detected by the administrator 
apparently, the type of stepping stone is very flexible. 
Intruder can use the stepping stone to launch various types of 
attacks, such as the dissemination of viruses, dictionary 
attacks, denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), malicious 
Trojan. Intruders sometime use the special stepping stone to 
announce faking information on public forum that cause 
damage to privacy of other internet users, but there are many 
administrators often ignore the seriousness of these kind 
problems. 
Our research identified the characteristic of stepping 
stone in the local network. Stepping stone will have high 
frequency of connecting record between two links, one is 
the connection of stepping stone to intruder's computer, the 
other is the connection of the victim computer to the 
stepping stone. It is not similar to the normal connection of 
internet user’s behavior. This research uses the technology 
of Association Rule Mining of data mining. We propose a

detecting model for identified the hiding stepping stone 
location base on network traffic records. If we figure out the 
suspected stepping stone using network traffic information 
that can help system manager to do more defense process 
before intruder made more harm. That also can help the 
network managers to trace back to find out the original 
attacking intruder’s IP address. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
Most of the research of detecting stepping stone attack 
focused on detection of intruder who uses stepping stone on 
encryption. Intruders in order to avoid detection from the 
contents of the packet attacks, they will use encrypted 
communications technology to control stepping stone. There 
are two types of detection method of detecting stepping stone 
on encrypted communications. One is Time-Based Method 
to classify the idle time[3], another is based on calculation of 
the Round Trip time (RTT) and cluster classification[4,5]. 
In Zhang[3] study, the Time-base method of detecting 
stepping stone is to use idle time to separate Network traffic. 
When user type the keyboard input, network traffic will have 
special idle time. If the occurrences of the two connections 
idle time often too close or identical, it is likely the keyboard 
input by the user using a particular connection and then enter 
another transmission connection. Therefore, the method use 
algorithms to identify suspected of connection is stepping 
stone. However, this method will deliberate miscarriage at 
the intruders enter the command to change the idle time. It 
must be set the default idle time very short to increase the 
detection sensitivity, but also caused an increase in detection 
missing rate. That cause the detection system is more 
difficultly to detecting the stepping stone. 
The study of Yang[4] provide Round Trip Time (RTT) 
method to detect the possibility of stepping stone for the 
network server. Round Trip Time refers to the time that a 
host from sending a packet to receive a packet. In a network 
connection chain, inter-host have different values of RTT 
because the distance between each other is different. After 
sending a series of consecutive packets and in accordance 
with the received packet time to calculate the RTT value is 
possible and Paints charts that can clearly to find the chain 
links in the network whether the existence of several host 
servers can respond. In the following study [5], instead of 
caring about the received packet should match which sent 
packet, letting every time of received packets minus times 
that sent before the received packet to get a large of RTT 
value. And used Maximum-minimum distance (MMD) 
classification to cluster and simplify the points that points' 
time and RTT value are similar, and then calculate the 
cluster rate and choice the cluster that has a higher rate. This 
classification method has been compared to the original RTT 
is more accurate results, and can use the RTT value of more 
than the original. Although the RTT method is more accurate 
way to find the connection chain in response to the 
computer, but it is must be calculated over a period of time 
all packets sent and received by the RTT. In large network 
area, RTT method may result in the burden of computing 
loading and less performance rate of cluster result. And even 
if the precise use of the calculated RTT to find the number of 
computers on the connection chain, it cannot actually point 
out the possibility of host which is launching stepping stone 
attacks. 
In using traffic pattern as the base of detection that does 
not to care about the packet whether it encrypt or not, and 
does not care about how long the idle time. There are 
different about using RTT information as the base of 
detection system. In this study do not figure the interval 
between send packets and receive packets, the detection 
system just uses the connection records in the local network. 
Using association rule algorithm to identified the IP pairs 
that appear frequently in each division time slots. For the 
more, using association rule mining try to figure out the IP 
pairs that have higher confidence. If the two pair of IP 
pattern has the same IP, it represents the IP address is 
suspect to be the stepping stone that is control by the 
intruder, and the other two IP addresses one is the source of 
intruder and the another is the target of attacking. 
 
3. Detection System 
 
The Association Rule Mining is trying to find the 
frequency of occurrence and identify information that may 
exist some potential Association Rule by using a lot of 
transaction data set[6]. This kind data mining technology has 
been widely used in many different areas of research. In this 
research, we use the association rules mining technology to 
identify possible stepping stone that are hiding in a large 
number of network connection records, also to help network 
managers to found security threats as soon as possible and 
take the necessary security measures. Our research proposed 
detection system architecture is as follows: 
 
 
Figure  1 Stepping stone detection System architecture 
 
z Data Warehouse  
In this study, we use the sniffing software to collect the 
stepping-stone and normal users’ connection traffic records 
in the local network. After collecting these data, we 
aggregate a data set. This data set is using to generate the 
association rules, there are two important parameters, 
Minimal Support and Minimal Confidence, and those are the 
threshold value to finding the stepping-stone in this network 
environment. In this research, the method of data aggregating 
approach is as follows: 
1177
 
Figure  2 Transaction data set aggregate method 
 
For each same length of time slot (Ti), there are 
retrieved IP patterns (t). In the same slot of time will not 
repeat the same IP pattern.  
 
z  Apriori Algorithm 
Apriori is a good performance algorithm for Association 
Rule of Mining[6]. Using the method of compute the Large 
Item Set, it can quickly obviate the data that are not conform 
to the Association Rule, and can find the Association Rule 
which conform two conditions, Minima Support and Minima 
Confidence, in a short counting process. The data that be 
produced by Apriori which conform the conditions set and 
comply with the following pattern: 
 
 
Figure  3 Association Rule of IP pairs 
 
Because in our captured data, the connection of IPs with IPa 
and the connection of IPs with IPv often appear together, the 
system will detect it is a suspecting stepping stone. 
 
4.  Experiment and Performance 
 
In this study the source of the data was collected from the 
host in the experimental environment in Kaohsiung National 
University. We use ssh(Secure Shell) client to connect to the 
host and then connect out to simulate the stepping stone for 
attacks, and using sniffing tool tcpdump to collect the 
connection records in the local network for an hour. There 
are totally about 19,400 connecting records in the period of 
our experiment. 
In this study just mining the connection IP information, 
we only aggregate the patterns of IP pairs information to 
12,290 and collecting by each  5 seconds as a time slots, 
there are a totally has 671 time slots and 244 IP pairs 
connection records. For each of the IP pairs are non-
repetition. For example, a ? b and b ? a be treated as the 
same IP pairs records. First we use the Apriori algorithm to 
calculate a single IP pairs have larger than the Minimum 
Support is 0.01. This means that the IP pairs in all time slots 
are greater than 1%.We let each other IP pairs match the 
other one to find out their Minimum Support larger than 0.01 
at the same time, then we check the Minimum Confidence of 
the IP pairs records are larger than 0.4 or not. 
 
For understand of the relation about the parameter of 
Association Rule and prediction accuracy. We evaluate the 
different Minimum Confidence from 0.1 to 1 and Minimum 
Support from 0.01 to 0.04. The curve of False Alarm Rate 
Minimum Confidence relation is show as Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure  4 False Alarm Rate of Minimum Confidence 
 
We can find the False Alarm Rate curves are decrease as 
the Minimum Confidence on different Minimum Support 
setting. In other words that means as the system set lower 
Minimum Confidence value that will cause the more suspect 
IP pairs are detected by the system, but that will increase the 
higher False Alarm Rate. In our experiment show that the 
Minimum Confidence setting as 0.4 maybe is a proper value, 
for different Minimum Support values, the False Alarm Rate 
are all decrease to 0. Under considering the situation of 
Positive Rate, we choice Minimum Support is 0.01 and 
Minimum Confidence is 0 .4 to set as the default value of the 
research experiment. 
The experimental results can get 4 pairs of IP pairs to 
conform to the Minimum Support ? 0.01 and Minimum 
Confidence ? 0.4. One pair of IP Pattern is to use ssh to 
simulate the stepping stone for attacks. Another IP pattern is 
the gateway communicates with the virtual gateway through 
the router, that is also similar like a specially stepping stone 
because the virtual gateway will transform the other host 
package at same time. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Work 
 
The stepping stone has become a serious threat of 
network security. This kind of intrusion method are 
implicative and difficultly to detect by network managers. 
Using stepping stone as an attacking tool is very flexible, 
intruder can use the stepping stone to launch many different 
various attacks. Stepping stone cause serious threat of 
network security but those are not easy to prevent for 
network administrators. In the study we propose an auto-
detection mechanism base on Association Rule Mining 
1178
technology and local network connection traffic data. We 
hope to recognize the characteristics of transmission traffic 
of the stepping stone, intruder host and victim computer, to 
construct a detection system to find out the suspected 
stepping stone that are hiding in local network environment. 
 
In this research, we use the ssh client to simulate the 
stepping stone behavior. There are totally about 19,400 
connect traffic data set in experimental local network 
environment. In the result of evaluation, we found that 
Minimal Confidence is an important indicator to determine 
the suspected stepping stone, it will have high False Alarm 
Rate when the value set too small. When the vale set to 0.4, 
the most of the suspected stepping stone can be detected. 
Setting of Minimal Support must be set greater than the 
Support value of the ordinary connection. 
 
In the real world, the stepping stone is not easy to obtain, 
in this study only could use the traffic of the experimental 
local network. In the future we hope to collect more real 
stepping stone connection traffic data, and more different 
stepping stone tool for generating the different kind traffic 
data type for example Netflow or SNMP. That can help us to 
evaluate the efficiency of this research proposed model. 
Wish the detection system can help network administrators 
to improve the security of internet.
