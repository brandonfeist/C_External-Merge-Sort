Abstract— In this article, tag and reader multi-standards RFID 
antennas are presented. These antennas are matched on one the 
UHF RFID regulate frequency band (860-960 MHz) and on the 
ECC UWB frequency band (6-8.5 GHz). Tag is composed of two 
antennas, one match for the RFID applications with classical 
RFID input impedance, one for UWB matched at 50 ?. Tag sizes 
are limited to credit card sizes (85x54 mm). Reader antenna is an 
association of a bowtie and a dipole antenna and it is matched on 
50 ? on twice bands. There is no sizes' specification for reader 
antennas. The substrate is FR4 0.8 mm thick for tag antennas 
and 1.6 mm for reader antennas. Epoxy's relative permittivity is 
4.4 and its dielectric loss tangent is 0.02.  Design rules, 
simulations, measures and perspectives are exposed. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is widely developed 
this last past years. One of the regulate frequency band for 
RFID applications is in the UHF band (860-960MHz). The 
main application is to identify automatically and in real time 
several devices thank to electromagnetic waves. 
Some applications need to identify and localize precisely a 
device into a dense environment[1]. It's possible to localize a 
device with UHF RFID technology thanks to RSS signals [2] 
but the positioning resolution suffers from multipath. To 
enhance it there are actually some research which applied 
Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technologies for positioning 
applications[2]. UWB short duration pulses permit to 
distinguish direct responses to multipath responses and could 
pass through several objects like walls, clothes, etc… 
 Moreover UWB systems are low power consumption systems 
and can be used close to other UHF RFID systems without 
suffering from interference due to the different radio spectrum 
required [2, 3]. There are two main standards for UWB 
applications: FCC with a frequency band between 3.1 and 
10.6 GHz for North America and ETSI 6-8.5 GHz for Europa.  
In this paper, two antennas' prototypes are presented, one for 
readers and the second one for tags. Reader and tag's antennas 
are designed to work in UHF RFID band (860-960MHz) and 
European UWB band (6-8.5 GHz). Reader antenna's sizes 
must be minimized because the overall system will be 
including into an embedded. In this, antenna's simulated and 
measured impedances and reflection coefficient are presented. 
Measure interpretations, design rules and radiation patterns 
are also available. Simulator used is Ansoft HFSS V 11. 
 
II. TAG ANTENNA 
A. Design 
Tag is composed of two antennas, one for the UHF RFID 
frequency band and the other one for UWB communications 
(Figure 1). Constraints on RFID tag antenna an UWB antenna 
are obviously different. Due to the RFID chip input 
impedance, the antenna need to be very inductive with a few 
resistances [8, 9]. In order to be perfectly matched to the chip, 
the UHF RFID antenna's impedance should be 12+j200 ? at 
868 MHz. Folded dipole respond to those specifications [10, 
11]. The impedance in UHF frequency band can be easily 
modified by varying L1, L2, L3 and L4 length.  
UWB systems are generally matched at 50 ? on the entire 
frequency band [12]. The small sizes of UWB antennas in 
comparison to UHF antennas permit to integrate them on a 
classical substrate UHF RFID substrate sizes. The shape and 
the way to match the UWB antenna are explained in [13].  
The highest challenge is to minimize coupling effect 
between UHF and UWB antennas.

B. Simulations and measures. 
Tag Substrate is FR4 0.8 mm thick with a relative 
permittivity of 4.4 and tan? = 0.02. Substrate sizes is 
equivalent to credit card sizes (85x54mm). 
Measurement environments are described in [14]. In the 
measurement condition, the antenna must be symmetric. It 
allows to solder half of the antenna on a metal plate 
considered as ground plane. In those conditions, the antenna is 
feed by a SMA connector which permit to deduce input 
impedance after deembedding. 
. 
 In UHF RFID band (860-960 MHz) measurements are 
close to simulations (Figure 2.a,b)), the main difference is a 
resistance greater in measurement. The impedance at 915 
MHz in simulation is Z=14+j235 (?) with 1.5 dBi gain 
(Figure 2and figure 3.a)).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
UWB chip has an impedance around 50? in European UWB's 
band (6-8.5 GHz) and the antenna have a reflection coefficient 
lower than 10dB (Figure 2.c)) with average gain around 5.5 
dBi (Figure 3.c)). Coupling between antennas are principally 
observed in the highest frequencies as shown in figure 3.c.

Tag antennas respect the specifications in term of sizes and 
matching. The RFID and UWB antennas are easily 
reconfigurable by varying the parameters previously describe. 
On UHF band, coupling effect between antennas are 
negligible, radiation pattern at 915 MHZ have the classical 
shape for dipole without perturbations. Coupling effects 
between the antennas are more important in UWB frequency 
band as it shows on the radiation pattern at 7.25 GHz. The 
antennas have common directivity along Y axis. 
III. READER ANTENNA 
A. Design 
The reader is a single antenna matched on twice band (860-
960 MHz and 6-8.5 GHz) with an impedance of 50 ?. The 
substrate is epoxy 1.6mm thick with r? =4.4 and 
tan?=0.02.The antenna sizes are 131x18.8mm and substrate 
sizes are 180x60 mm (Figure 4). Its structure is composed of 
planar dipoles. The reasons are: it is not necessarily to have a 
ground (because dipoles are differential antennas) and it is 
possible to make wideband matching [12, 13]. 
 The main planar dipole is a straight dipole it's a narrow 
band antenna easily configurable on UHF RFID band. The 
other dipoles are bow-tie antennas mostly used for UWB 
applications [13]. Connections between these different dipoles 
are assumed by lines. These lines are as thin as possible (100 
µm) in order to have impedance close to open circuit on UHF 
band. Thanks to that, at 915 MHz most of the current is 
propagate through the straight dipole. In the highest 
frequencies current distribution is most homogeneous on all of 
the dipoles. Geometrical parameters are summarized on figure 
4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Simulation and Measurements 
In UHF band the reflection coefficient is lower than -10 dB. 
In this frequency band measures are not perfectly closed to 
simulation (Figure 5 b)) due to a difference of reactance 
(Figure 5 a)). Between 6 and 8.5 GHz reflection coefficient 
are lower to 14 dB in simulation and 12.5 dB on measures 
(Figure 5 c)).The radiation pattern at 915 MHz is equivalent to 
a classical dipole radiation pattern because most of the current 
is propagated through the main dipole. At 915 MHz maximum 
gain is 1.8 dBi (Figure 6.a)). In higher frequencies, the current 
distribution is homogeneous so around 7.25 GHz the antenna 
radiates in many directions (Figure 6.b)). The main dipole is 
the most fluent parameter in UHF RFID band. To enlarge or 
shift the UWB match band without perturb too much 
matching in UHF band it is advised to only vary the sizes and 
the angle of the bow-tie antenna [6].

Reader antenna is the summation of two dipoles antennas. 
Each dipole is a classical antenna for the associate application. 
They are matched on twice band and have a common radiation 
area on UHF and UWB frequency band. Thanks to that it is 
possible to communicate and feed a tag on a direction. 
Substrate and fabrication process permit to minimize cost 
production. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
This article presented different antenna's topologies for 
UHF and UWB RFID applications. Concerning tag antennas, 
a multi-chip solution was chosen and the main difficulties 
consist to minimize coupling effects between UHF and UWB 
antenna. UHF antenna has typical impedance and it is possible 
to reconfigure it easily to every kind of UHF RFID chip 
impedance. UWB antenna has a classical shape and the 
reflection coefficient is lower than 10 dB. Reader antenna 
cover twice band with an impedance of 50?. It's matched in 
simulation and measure to all UHF RFID and European UWB 
bands with a reflection coefficient lower than 10 dB. 
Perspectives are to design a reader and tag antenna matched 
on all UHF RFID and FCC UWB frequency band.[13]
