Abstract-The purpose of this paper is to find the most suitable 
syndrome healed by commonly paired herbs in Chinese 
compound formula. A new method based on Chinese medicine 
literature and association rule technique is proposed, which 
solves the disadvantage of the minimum support degree in 
many studies. The results are validated by the theory of 
traditional Chinese medicine. The results illustrate that the 
new method is effective and suitable to be used generally.

I. INTRODUCTION 
compatibility; 
Recently literature of traditional Chinese medicine 
research based on association rules mainly focused on the 
association among herbs, but herb and syndrome or 
syndromes. However, there are two disadvantages in most 
literatures in this field. One of them was that the subjects 
developed were limited to homogeneous formulas or a 
formula applicable to one kind of syndrome [1-3]. The other 
was that the minimum support degree is about 0.1[4-7], 
which was too small to make the results convinced. 
In fact, the relationship between herb and prescription, 
prescription and syndrome, and prescription and symptoms 
are also important to find the insight of Chinese medicine. 
Association rule which can report the interesting relation 
among dataset is an important technique in data mining. It is 
one of the most classical methods to research traditional 
Chinese medicine composition rules now. 
This goal of this paper is to find the most suitable 
syndrome healed by commonly paired herbs in traditional 
Chinese medicine. Firstly the strong correlation paired herbs 
with each syndrome is mined through the whole database 
where most of prescriptions for universal relief called 
pujifang[8] are, then commonly used paired herbs are 
identified based on the number of syndromes healed by the 
strong correlation herbs. Finally the most suitable syndrome 
for commonly paired herbs is estimated by the degree of 
confidence and support and validated by the theory of 
traditional Chinese medicine.

II. METHOD OF A S SOCIATION RULES 
A. Data model 
Data model is developed based on the content of 
prescriptions for universal relief. There are two kinds of data 
model. One is for describing the entities and the other is for 
presenting the relations between the entities. Table I , Table 
II and Table III are about the prescription, herb and 
syndrome separately. TableN is to save the relation between 
prescription and herb, and Table V is to save the relation 
between prescription and syndrome. 
B. Data mining methods 
Generally a syndrome could be healed by several 
prescriptions, and each prescription is composed of several 
herbs. Firstly, Strong associated herbs of each syndrome are 
mined by associated rule algorithm through the whole 
database or the part of database specified by the user. 
Secondly, commonly used associated herbs are confirmed 
based on their frequency in the syndrome of the whole 
database. Thirdly, the most suitable syndrome with coupled 
herbs is confirmed based on the support degree and 
confidence degree. Finally the traditional Chinese medicine 
theory is used to valid this result. The associated rule 
algorithm used in step one is described as follows: 
1) Model of associated rule 
There are a lot of prescriptions in the database, each of 
which is as a transaction T. Set I = {II' 12 ,.Ii'" In} is a set 
of herbs. Support degree Support(I;) is equal to the 
frequency of herb Ii in specified transactions P(Ii) . 
Confidence degree Confidence(Ii ? I j ) is equal 
to Support(1i U Ij) / Support(1i) . 
2) Algorithm of associated rule 
A basic algorithm called Apriori proposed by Agrawal in 
1993 is used for this model. This algorithm is based on the 
computations of frequent sets in two stages. The first stage is 
to find the frequent sets and the second one is to generate 
association rules.

a) To find the frequent sets 
This step is to find all frequent sets based on the minimum 
support degree which has been specified by the user at the 
beginning of this algorithm. In other words, the support 
degree of each frequent set must be bigger than minimum 
support degree. Apriori is a kind of iteration method. Firstly, 
frequent set L 1 which includes an herb is got. Secondly 
frequent set L2 which includes two herbs is got. Then 
continue this iterative until can't find frequent setLk. 
b) To find the associate rules 
This step is to find all the associated rules sets based on the 
minimum confidence degree which has been specified by 
the user at the beginning of this algorithm. At first, all non­
empty subsets of each frequent set are generated. At second, 
the confidence degree of each two non-empty subsets is 
computed. At last, the associated rules are those subsets 
whose confidence degree is bigger than the minimum 
confidence degree. 
III. EXPERIMENT ANALYSES 
A. Experiment design 
The sensitivity analysis of the algorithm parameters is 
used to find the suitable parameters. Figure 1 presents the 
change of the number of associated rules with the decreasing 
minimum support degree when the minimum confidence 
degree is set to 0.7. Figure 2 presents the change of the 
number of associated rules with the decreasing minimum 
confidence degree when the minimum support degree is set 
to 0.4.

The algorithm parameters are confirmed based on Figure 
and 2 to make the algorithm find enough effective 
associated rules. The arrange of the minimum support 
degree is from 0.3 to 0.5 and the arrange of the minimum 
confidence degree is from 0.7 to 0.9. Moreover, the number 
of prescriptions for each syndrome is at least 20. The 
uncommon syndrome is excluded in this way. Finally, three 
experiments are set to find the most suitable syndrome with 
commonly paired herbs in Table VI. 
B. Results of Experiment 
The results of three experiments illustrates in Table VB 
that the number of associated rules becomes less with the 
increasing minimum support degree and confidence degree. 
Three mostly common paired herbs in Table VIII are 
gotten based on the frequency in all syndromes from three 
experiments. For example, the paired herb of Poria cocos 
and Panax ginseng are used for healing fourteen different 
syndromes in experiment one, eight different syndromes in 
experiment two, and two different syndromes in experiment 
three. Poria cocos and Panax ginseng are associated, and 
they might be used more commonly than other associated 
herbs. In this way, Poria cocos and Panax ginseng are called 
commonly paired herbs based on the experiments. 
The support and confidence degree of Poria cocos and 
Panax ginseng for different syndrome are listed in TableIX. 
Chill and fever in consumptive disease and palpitation and 
alarm due to wind are the suitable syndromes healed by 
Poria cocos and Panax ginseng.

C. Discussion 
The experiment results show that Poria cocos and Panax 
ginseng are the commonly used paired herbs in prescriptions 
for universal relief database. Syndrome chill and fever in 
consumptive disease and syndrome palpitation and alarm 
due to wind are the most suitable syndromes for Poria cocos 
and Panax ginseng. It is well known that poria cocos and 
panax ginseng are both sweet in taste, meridian entry to 
spleen, lung, heart and kidney. According to theory of herbs 
nature in traditional Chinese medicine, the common function 
of these two herbs are strengthening spleen, replenishing qi, 
calming the heart and tranquilizing the mind. So Panax 
ginseng is usually used together with Poria cocos to cure 
such diseases as asthenia, consumptive disease, thinness and 
weakness, no thought of food and drink, distention and 
fullness and lack of qi induced by syndrome of deficiency of 
spleen qi and stomach qi. They can also be used to cure 
palpitation due to alarm and insomnia belongs to the heart 
mind malnutrition. Panax ginseng associated Poria cocos are 
common coupled medicine in ancient and modem clinic. So 
the experiment proved that association rules can discover the 
strong relationship between two herbs.
