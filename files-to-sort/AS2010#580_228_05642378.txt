Abstract-With the constant stress from work load and daily life 
people may show symptoms of melancholia. However, most 
people are reluctant to describe it or may not know that they 
already have it. In this paper a novel system is proposed to 
discover clues from patient's interaction with psychologist or 
from self-recorded voice or text messages. A user friendly 
interface is provided for patients to input text messages or record 
a voice file by mobile phones or other input devices. A speech-to­
text conversion software is used to convert voice mails to simple 
text files in advance. Based on the text files, a data mining model 
is used to discover frequent keywords mentioned in the text or 
speech files. The association rules can be used to help 
psychologists diagnose patients' degree of melancholia. 
Experimental results show that the proposed system can 
effectively discover melancholia keywords. 
Keywords-Data Mining, association rules, fuzzy model, word 
segmentation. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Stress is a problem of modem society. People in different 
levels have faced different degree of stress. Stress may be 
reflected in the daily speech or in people's interaction with 
others. This makes some people prone to psychological 
symptoms such as melancholia and unconscious emotion 
reaction. Some people even do not know that they repeatedly 
mentioned some words in a short conversation with others. 
Consequently, a system that can help people early self­
diagnose depression or help psychologist discover patients' 
unknown symptom is indispensible. In this paper data mining 
strategy is used to extract interesting association rules from 
patients' text messages. 
Data mining is a technology developed to discover 
previously unknown but useful information from a large 
database. Two general criteria are applied to evaluate the 
interestingness of a discovered association rule, i.e., support 
and confidence. Support indicates the frequency of an item 
appearing in the transaction database. Confidence of X 7 Y 
implies the ratio of both itemsets X and Y simultaneous 
appearance to the frequency of X in the transactions. One 
commonly mentioned rule is ''those who buy beers in the 
weekend will also buy diaper at the same time" [1, 2]. Without 
data mining technique, this important information may never 
be dug out from a supermarket database. The discovered 
association rules can be applied to promote a company's profit.

For example, the supermarket can allocate both beer and diaper 
close to each other so that customers can easily find them. 
This data mining concept is adopted in this study. 
Assuming a microphone is used to record a patient speech [3]. 
We then apply the data mining technique to find the 
associations among the spoken words. This is done by first 
converting the voice mails to text. Then, a term segmentation 
module is applied to segment words or phrases from the 
sentences. To perform the term segmentation, an on-line 
service module CKlP (Chinese Knowledge Information 
Processing Group) provided by Academia Sinica, Taiwan is 
used. Only nouns, verbs and adjectives in the segmented words 
are maintained as keywords and the rest are removed from the 
keyword list to simplify the analysis. After soliciting important 
keywords, they can be used to find the associations among 
them. For example, if both terms "daughter-in-law" and 
''unfilial'' appear frequently in the text message, it may imply 
that the relationship between the mother and the daughter-in­
law needs to be adjusted [4]. Besides, the emotional degree of a 
keyword can be used to diagnose the degree of melancholia [5]. 
For those with low depression or light symptom in psychology, 
the proposed system can be used to help patients detect and 
heal the symptoms earlier [6]. Of course, our work is heavily 
dependent on the determination of keywords' weights. In our 
study melancholia keywords are more valuable than other 
frequent words. Therefore, a depression degree of keywords 
measure is proposed. 
This paper is organized as follows: methods for word 
segmentation, temporal data mining algorithm and fuzzy 
modeling are introduced in section II. The required hardware 
implemented in our experiments is illustrated in section III. 
Experimental results and analyses are presented in section IV. 
Conclusions and future research are given the fmal section. 
II. RELATED WORK 
2.1 Word Segmentation 
Word segmentation is a crucial preprocessing step in 
natural language processing, such as voice recognition, 
document retrieval and machine translation. The results from 
word segmentation will affect the underlying discovery of 
frequent words in speech/text files. In English, a blank between 
two words indicate a natural boundary of separating two words. 
Compared to Chinese, English words are easier to segment. 
3523 
Chinese sentences are composed of a series of words that make 
them hard to segment into meaningful phrases. Besides word 
segmentation it may be hard to assess the meaningfulness of a 
phrase. People's names, names of cities, terminologies and 
acronyms are examples that cannot be completely collected 
into the databases. These are the challenges for the word 
segmentation systems to be resolved. For example, in the 
Chinese sentence r ft 111= 5'C Ill. lIZ 5l ? (I ate hamburger for 
last night dinner)J we expect to segment the sentence into the 
meaningful term set: {ft,II1=5'C,Ill.,IIZ,5lil}. Thus, a huge 
thesaurus database is needed to solicit meaningful words from 
sentences. 
The CKIP word segmentation system [6] developed by 
Academia Sinica, Taiwan is exploited to extract meaningful 
words from sentences. The CKIP system provides the on-line 
word segmentation service that is based on XML data 
exchange mode. Users can use TCP Sockets to deliver their 
text messages to the segmentation system [7] to parse the 
marked-up XML results that include the segmented words and 
their corresponding term. 
2.2 Fuzzy Set Theory 
Proposed by Lotfi A. Zadeh in 1965 [8] fuzzy set theory 
has extended its domain from theoretical study [9] to diverse 
areas such as auto-focus device in camcorders, water flow 
control in washing machines, temperature control in air­
conditioners, auto-driving system in subway. Fuzzy set uses 
values between 0 and I to denote the degree of an element 
belonging to a set that is different from the traditional crisp set. 
We apply the fuzzy concept to denote the relative frequency of 
a segmented word to other words in a text file. 
2.3 Association rules and FP-tree 
The idea of fmding association rules from a large 
transaction database was first proposed by Agrawal et. al. [13]. 
Then, there are various algorithms presented to tackle the 
discovery of association rules from databases [10,11,14]. 
An association rule is expressed as: X ? Y , where X and 
Y represent two item sets. The rule indicates that if X were 
purchased then Y may be purchased at the same time. To 
discover the interesting association rules X ? Y , scanning the 
database to find occurring frequencies of both X and Xu Y is 
required. The appearance frequency of an item in the database 
is termed as support that means the frequency of the item 
appearing in the transactions. The support of X u Y is the 
frequency of union sets X and Y appearing in the same 
transactions. If the support of X u Y is divided by the support 
of X, the quotient is termed the confidence of X ? Y . If the 
confidence overpasses the preset threshold, then the association 
rule X ? Y is treated interesting. 
The first step to discover the association rules is to fmd out 
the large itemsets. There are two approaches to fmd the rules. 
One approach is to generate the candidate itemsets and the 
other does not generate candidate itemsets during the mining 
processes. Apriori is a representative that generates candidate 
itemsets. On the contrary, FP-tree did not rely on generating 
candidate itemsets to find association rules that result in a 
reduced execution time. The procedures to construct a FP-tree 
are described as follows: 
(1) Scanning the database once and removing the duplicated 
items. Expressing those items with support greater than 
or equal to minimum support in itemset ? . 
(2) Ranking items in LI in descending order. 
(3) Scanning the database again to construct a FP-tree and 
fmd all frequent itemset from the tree. 
It is obvious that a database is scanned only twice in FP­
tree to fmd frequent itemsets. Apriori algorithm, however, took 
much time in repeatedly scanning the database to fmd the same 
results. Fig. 1 is an example that illustrates how a FP-tree is 
constructed.

III. SYSTEM FRAMWORK 
To provide a simple way for users to upload their files to 
the system, either text or voice files are acceptable. A user can 
record a voice or text message either by computer or mobile 
phone. In the preliminary study, text messages are used for 
analysis. Then, the text messages are segmented to extract the 
keywords that show some degree of repetitions in speaking or 
texts or have some negative emotion. The analytical results can 
be used to remind the users themselves or their relatives to pay 
attention to the users speaking and emotion management. 
The following describes the procedures to discover fuzzy 
association rules from a converted text message. 
(1) Word segmentation: the CKIP word segmentation system 
developed by Academia Sinica, Taiwan is applied to 
extract keywords from text files. 
3524 
(2) Keyword filtering: the extracted keywords are further 
filtered to remove undesired words and only nouns, verbs 
and adjectives are maintained. 
(3) Weight calculation: the weight of a word is determined by 
its term frequency and its matching degree to the thesaurus 
of melancholia database. The weights of words are ranked 
in descending order to solicit the keywords in the text 
message. 
(4) Fuzzy data mining: the keywords are analyzed by the 
fuzzy association rules [12,15] to fmd their associations 
and their fuzzy melancholia degrees. 
The procedures to fmd fuzzy association rules among 
keywords are shown in Fig. 2.

\Neight 
Fig. 2. Procedures to find fuzzy association rules among keywords. 
The operational flow chart of the proposed system is shown 
in Fig. 3. For voice files they are converted to text messages 
before processing. A text message is then segmented into terms 
as shown in Fig. 4. Only nouns, verbs and adjectives in the 
segmented words are maintained as keywords and the rest are 
removed from the keyword list. The purpose here is to remove 
the platitude or uninteresting words and make the analytical 
results more accurate. 
After segmenting words from sentences, the next step 
involves soliciting representative keywords. First, the term 
frequencies of keywords must be ranked in descending order. 
However, the term frequency is not the only criterion to 
determine its importance in the text message. For example, if 
both "daughter-in-law" and "unfilial" were frequently 
mentioned in the text, then there is no doubt that both are 
treated as important keywords. In reality, low term frequency 
words may also be critical keywords. For example, "suicide" 
may appear once in the whole text message but it may play the 
decisive role in determining that the patient has melancholia. A 
new strategy is proposed to calculate the weight for a keyword. 
Before determining the weight of a keyword, a melancholia 
thesaurus is given in Table 1. In the thesaurus, each keyword is 
given a figure to denote its degree of emotional depression. The 
following is explanation for this thesaurus. There are many 
reasons to cause symptoms of depression, for example, losing 
loved ones, losing job and getting ill. Changing in thinking is a 
common symptom such as patients feel that there is no hope in 
life and have no value in society. According to above possible 
symptom, our research defmes several keywords of depression 
to put the keywords in depression thesaurus such as "sad" and 
"disappointment". There are more serious symptoms that will 
have very negative thoughts, for example, often thinking of 
death and attempting to commit suicide. These patients think 
death can solve everything. This level of thinking is often very 
severe symptoms of depression. So our research defmes other 
keywords of depression such as "suicide" and "dead". Then the 
weight of "suicide" and "dead" must higher than "sad" and 
"disappointment" because of that symptom is more serious. Of 
course, the depression degree should be derived from the 
domain experts. In this study, only simulation figures are given 
for experiments. 
Assuming the term frequency and the depression degree in 
the thesaurus each has 50% of importance to the weight. Take 
the term of "daughter-in-law" for example. Its weight is 
calculated as 0.135x0.5+0xO.5=0.068 due to the fact that 
"daughter-in-law" did not appear in the melancholia thesaurus 
and its depression degree is zero. For the term of "suicide", it 
weight is 0.027 x 0.5 + 0.07 x 0.5 = 0.049 due to its depression 
degree in the thesaurus of 7%. By introducing the depression 
degree, a seldom appearance term may take a better position in 
the ranking list of importance as shown in Table 2.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
A melancholia database is used to record patients' mood or 
emotion. In the following experiments only text messages are 
solicited for analysis and the other infonnation is discarded to 
protect patients' privacy. The following five negative emotion 
messages were solicited for the experiments. One sample text 
message is "My daughter-in-law is very unfilial and does not 
cook. I, an elder, cook myself. How come there is such a 
daughter-in-law who is very unfilial. I am very disappointed 
about her. I told my son that he should say something to her 
and be filial. It is the golden rule that a daughter-in-law should 
be filial to the mother-in-law. After marrying to my son she is 
very unfilial and I feel so disappointed. I want to commit 
suicide." as shown in the upper part of Fig. 4. Note that the 
original Chinese text is: "?1Ii.a'iJ?1'?titi1'.ilH!:ft-
??A??.2M*.?.?1Ii.a'iJ?1'?ftti?1Ii$* 
??ft???T??D?1Iia??-??.a'iJ??1'?? 
?Mti???.???.?*ft???M1'?ft.??? 
?1liiJ?!I!1!I?." 
After combining both tenn frequency and melancholia 
degree into calculation, the weights are given in Table 2. In our 
experiments, the weight for the parent node is also considered. 
A parent node is considered to emphasize the role of keywords 
in melancholia database playing in the analysis. Thus, weight 
for the parent node Tl in Table 3 is the addition of weights 
attached to the corresponding keywords in the melancholia 
database. For example, (suicide, 0.049)+(disappointment, 
0.032)=(Tl, 0.081) for the first message in Table 3. 
Next, we will defme membership functions for the weights 
of solicited keywords as shown in Fig. 5. In our experiments, 
three labels, Low, Medium and High, are defmed for the 
variable "weight." This step fuzzifies the weights into the 
mapping linguistic variables that are easier to be verified by 
psychologist. The fuzzy sets converted from membership 
functions are given in Table 4. 
Since each weight may be mapped to more than one 
linguistic tenn the one with higher membership degree is 
chosen as the linguistic tenn for the keyword. For example, the 
keyword "unfilial" has a calculated weight of 0.041 in the first 
message. Then, the weight of 0.041 is transfonned to Medium 
because it has membership degrees of 0.45 and 0.55 in Low 
and Medium, respectively. As a result, each solicited keyword 
is accompanied a linguistic tenn to denote its depression degree. 
Based on the fuzzy degrees given in Table 4 we can sum up the 
depression degree for each keyword and its accompanied 
linguistic tenn for a patient in a certain period of time. For 
example, "unfilial and medium" has a total depression degree 
of 0.8 summing from the first and the 5th messages. If the 
threshold of depression membership degree is set to 0.8, then 
some unqualified keywords can be removed from succeeding 
analysis as shown in Table 5. The candidate keywords are then 
used to construct a FP-tree as shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. FP-tree for the solicited keywords. 
From the constructed FP-tree we can fmd the association 
rules among the keywords. For example, if we want to fmd the 
association rule (daughter-in-Iaw,H)-7(Tl,H), then its 
confidence value can be calculated as follows: 
L «daughter - in - Jaw, H) (') (T!, H» 1.4 -=73%' L (daughter - in - Jaw, H) 1.9 
The figure given in the numerator of the above equation is 
derived from taking the minimum operation on the associated 
terms as shown in Table 6. The derived association rule, 
(daughter-in-Iaw,H)-7(Tl,H), implies that if the term 
"daughter-in-law" belongs to the linguistic term "High" then it 
is probable that the patient shows some degree of depression. 
This is because (Tl,H) indicates the high degree of depression 
in the melancholia thesaurus. Besides, based on this association 
rule, we can guess that the mother and her daughter-in-law 
have some problems to get along with in the daily life. 
Consequently, the mother often mentioned the term "daughter­
in-law" in her messages. Also, another association rule, 
(daughter-in-Iaw,H)-7(suicide,M) with a confidence of 73%, is 
found from our analysis. The analytical results can help detect a 
patient depression degree and take any necessary action to 
protect from commit suicide. Other association rules 
discovered from the given example are listed in Table 7.

v. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper FP-tree is used to discover association rules 
from patient's text messages. An user interface is devised for 
patients to upload their text messages or voice mails. For those 
voice mails, a speech-to-text module is expolited to make the 
conversion. A CKIP module provided by Academia Sinica, 
Taiwan is used to segment words from sentences and remove 
trivial words from succeeding analysis. A melancholia 
thesaurus is also established to take the emotional or 
depression keywords into consideration. Both term frequency 
and melancholia keywords are considered to calculate a term's 
weight. Fuzzy membership functions are also defined to 
fuzzify a term weight. A keyword is attached with its 
corresponding linguistic term to denote its degree of 
depression. Based on the paired keywords and linguistic terms, 
FP-tree is used to discover the association rules among them. 
The discovered results can help psychologist diagnose their 
patients' degrees of melancholia and take any necessary action 
in advance to prevent from commit suicide. Besides, the 
analytical results can help patients themselves adjust their 
social relationships with friends or relatives, or remind 
themselves paying more attention to their psychological 
conditions. 
The current results are based on the analysis from text 
messages. Using speech-to-text module to convert voice mails 
into text messages or analyzing the voice mails directly is a 
great challenge in the continuing study. How to segment terms 
from sentences and then how to determine meaningful 
keywords or phrases from terms are also deserved further 
study in the future.
