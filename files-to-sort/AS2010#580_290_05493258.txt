I. INTRODUCTION 
With the continuous improvement on the level of research 
management, the scientific research administrative personnel 
hope that they can in conduct the scientific research and the 
policy-making support management on the basis of the existing 
mass data analysis. However, these data, involving a larger 
perspective, are voluminous, the present Event-driven database 
is difficult to achieve information synthesis and comprehensive, 
flexible, multi-angle analysis on a large amounts of data, thus 
do not have decision-making support capability. In order to 
more effectively make use of each scientific research project to 
take scientific and technological development goals, scientific 
research management decision-makers carry on statistical 
analysis frequently on the benefit from the project, including 
the ability to train professional and technical personnel, the 
inputs and outputs funding inputs and outputs, the comparative 
analysis on the execution and completion process of the project 
the comparative analysis ,etc. In order to solve the actual 
problems encountered in the process of benefit analysis and the 
policy-making support, this article proposed a framework that 
combines data warehouse, associated data mining and the 
OLAP technology, and constructed the Handan City Science 
and Technology Plan Project Implementation Survey System. 
II. GENERAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE  SYSTEM 
This system take the data warehouse as the foundation, 
OLAP multidimensional analysis as a means, and the 
associative rules to carry on data mining. Users may act 
according to the demand to extract data from the progress of 
the data warehouse, analyze the project progress, dig out useful 
information with associative rule for decision support, then 
demonstrate the result in the front end of the user interface. as 
shown in Fig1. The hierarchy system is divided into four layers: 
data source layer, data storage layer, data processing layer, and 
data demonstration layer. 
Data source layer: the basis of the data warehouse on which 
users extract the required information for refining, cleaning and 
conversion so as to load into the data marts. 
Data storage layer: After effective integration the 
previously cleaned data, organize the result by the subject in 
order to carry on multidimensional analysis and data mining. 
Data Processing Layer: with inquiry sentences the OLAP 
server extract data sets required by data warehouse and carry 
on multidimensional data analysis in it. Data mining extracted 
the useful knowledge from the data warehouse using 
association rules.  
Data demonstration layer: namely the user interface. The 
OLAP front end analysis system demonstrate the results in 
visualized form, such as tables and graphics. Data mining helps 
decision-makers find potential linkage between data sets to 
support tendency prediction and decision-making. 
III. THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OLAP 
A. Design of Multidimensional Data Mode 
Data model is a typical form of data structure, and a 
recognition of the real-world from a different extraction level. 
Different data model of extraction level can be established  
from the real world through step by step abstraction, refinement.

The aim of the data model design is to visualize the 
organizational structure and the relationship of the data in an 
intuitive way, which will be served as the basis for further 
design and impmentation, hence get the specific data structure 
of the system, and form the system framework. Though the 
data warehouse fact tables and dimension tables are organized 
according to the analysis subject, they are still stored in the 
form of two-dimensional table in a relational database. In order 
to facilitate the OLAP multidimensional analysis, OLAP tools 
are used to create multi-dimensional data sets, then carry on 
multi-dimensional processing to data warehouse's data, and 
present to the front end user in an easy to understand form. 
In order to get the multi-dimensional data set  to be used in 
the OLAP analysis in Handan City Science and Technology 
Plan Project Implementation Survey System, several aspects  
needs to take into consideration, including  theme analysis, 
logistic model design, metric standard and processing method. 
1) theme Analysis :Multi-dimensional data sets are also 
subject oriented, the same as the data warehouse. In this step, 
analysis theme should be pre-determined, then carry on 
explicit description for each subject domain. The original 
database contains two correlated crossing themes, the basic 
project information theme and the project progress information 
theme. As the core of the system is to implement management 
of these projects, when issuing multi-dimensional data model 
design work will be carried on around project progress theme 
to establish fact tables. 
2)  Logical model design:The logistic model directly 
reflect business department’s requirements and plays an major

role for system implementation, is an important step in the 
process of data warehouse implementation. This system's 
logistic employs star model, the structure characteristics of star 
which is: in the center is a big and redundancy free fact table 
that is used to store dimension table foreign key and metric 
value for each dimension; around which is a small group of 
affiliated table, called dimensiontable which is an entity of 
record an organization wants and contains dimension levels 
and member types etc. Each dimension use at least a table to 
hold its metadata. Dimension tables appear on the rays 
scattered from the fact table, like the outburst of stars. That’s 
why stars mode bears its name. The system logic model is 
shown in Figure 2. 
3)  metrics value:The metrics value refers to the columns 
of data that is used as an indicator to reflect  one aspect of the 
multi-dimension data sets, and is the key data when the end-
user browsing multi-dimensional data. Metric values of  the 
multi-dimensional data sets can be obtained through simple 
process by data warehouse or obtained from the computation 
result of other metrics value. 
4)  processing method:When the construction of storage 
structure of the multi-dimensional data sets is finished, no data 
was actually put in and needs to be processed. The processing 
process begins when the data is transferred from the data 
source to data warehouse. After aggregation calculation the 
results are stored in the multi-dimensional data set. When 
issuing analysis and query the user only needs to read the 
processed data from the MSOLAP server rather than extract 
the unprocessed data from data warehouse.
B. OLAP analysis 
The OLAP analysis is mainly focused on analysis, such as 
slicing, dicing, drilling, and rotation on  the multi-dimensional 
data. Slicing refers to concentrate to observe data in two 
dimensions. Dicing refers to choose certain dimensions(3 
usually) to carry on analysis. Drill-down refers to observe 
multi-dimensional data from the synthesized data on a higher 
level dimension to the detailed data on a lower level dimension. 
Drill-up refer to carry on aggregation analysis from detailed 
data to synthesized data. Rotation refers to change the location 
relationship between dimensions to facilitate user to observe 
data from another perspective. After the OLAP analysis users 
can observe the data from multiple dimensions, multiple 
perspectives, and multiple aggregative degrees as to find the 
rules hidden behind the data. 
IV. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES 
ALGORITHM
The association rule describes the knowledge pattern of 
rules that appears simultaneously in a transaction between the 
event, therefore association rules can be employed to spot the 
connection pattern hidden in the scientific research data 
attribute. The most classical connection rule algorithm is the 
Apriori algorithm which is proposed by R.Agrawal, Imielinski 
and Swam etc. support coefficient and confidence coefficient 
are two important concepts used to describe association rules, 
the former used to measure significance of association rules in 
the whole data set, the latter used to measure the credibility of 
the association rules. The classical Apriori algorithm carries on 
full pruning to the item set, and only calculate the support 
coefficient of the candidate item set which are greater than or 
equal to the minimum support coefficient. However, with k 
increases, the length of each candidate item in Ck also 
increases correspondingly, but the support coefficient 
decrease,and the Apriori algorithm have to scan the whole 
database to carry on support coefficient computation thus waste 
a lot of time. Therefore, improved algorithm is proposed in this 
excavation. Ideas of the improved algorithm is as follows: 
• Corollary 1: Any item set in Ck must be a superset of 
some item set in Ck-1.
• Corollary 2: If the number of item set in a transaction 
that contains Ck-1 is less than k, then delete( or ignore) 
the transaction has no effect on the calculation of 
Lj(j>=k). 
According to the above deduction, Given that the scale of 
item set remains the same, we use Lk, Ck to select the database, 
thus reduced the times searching for the record in the database, 
finally improved the efficiency of the algorithm. The main idea 
of adapted Apriori algorithm is to delete  transactions that do 
not contain any item set of Ck+1 at the link stage when 
produces Ck+1 initially. There is no need to carry on 
support .coefficient computation, so the record number related 
with support coefficient calculation for the candidate item set is 
less than that in the original database, thus increased the 
algorithm efficiency at last. 
This paper take the researchers’ workload, the finished 
scientific and technological papers and reports, and the 
completion level of the project as an example to describe the 
complete process of association rules. Summarized according 
to the actual situation of the system, the results is shown in 
Table 1: 
According to the distributed characteristic of the attribute 
data ,carry on the discretization and integraliztion on the 
attribute value, and finally represented as boolean value. For 
convenience, researchers’ workload attribute is simplified as G, 
the number of scientific and technological papers and reports is 
simplified as W, and use P to stand for completion level of the 
project, for short. 
The separated and integeralized data sheet are shown in 
Table 2. Here, the attribute values can be transformed into yes 
or no boolean variables of association rules. For example, G1 
stands for the workload of G is at level1, W2 stands for the

number of scientific and technological papers and reports is at 
level 2, P3 stands for the completion level of the project is at 
level 3, and so on. The boolean value result is shown in Table2. 
Use the connection rule generation algorithm, and trace the 
implementation process given Minconfidence=0.85. We get 
two strong association rules we interested in: 
• {G4?B3}         confidence=0.84 
• {G3G2?P1} confidence=0.882 
We used interest measurement method to measure interest 
degree for the above strong association rule, and the results is 
shown in Table 3.: 

What can be seen in Table 4 is the probability that G’s 
occurrence causes W’s occurrence increases, that is G’s 
occurrence plays an positive role on W’s occurrence. so 
G?W rule can be used as knowledge to provide to the policy-
maker.
