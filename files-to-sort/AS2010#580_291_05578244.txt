Keynote: Protein Structure Prediction and its 
Understanding Based on Machine Learning Methods
Professor Yi Pan, Georgia State University, USA
About the Keynote Speaker
Prof. Pan’s research interests include parallel and distributed 
computing, optical networks, wireless networks, and 
bioinformatics. Dr. Pan has published more than 100 journal 
papers with 40 papers published in various IEEE journals. In 
addition, he has published over 100 papers in refereed 
conferences (including IPDPS, ICPP, ICDCS, INFOCOM, and 
GLOBECOM). He has also co-authored/co-edited 33 books 
(including proceedings) and contributed several book chapters. 
His pioneer work on computing using reconfigurable optical 
buses has inspired extensive subsequent work by many 
researchers, and his research results have been cited by more 
than 100 researchers worldwide in books, theses, journal and 
conference papers. He is a co-inventor of three U.S. patents 
(pending) and 5 provisional patents, and has received many 
awards from agencies such as NSF, AFOSR, JSPS, IISF and 
Mellon Foundation. His recent research has been supported by 
NSF, NIH, NSFC, AFOSR, AFRL, JSPS, IISF and the states of 
Georgia and Ohio. He has served as a reviewer/panelist for 
many research foundations/agencies such as the U.S. National 
Science Foundation, the Natural Sciences and Engineering 
Research Council of Canada, the US-Israel Binational Science 
Foundation, the Australian Research Council, the Swedish 
Research Council, and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council. 
Prof. Pan has served as an Editor-in-Chief or editorial board 
member for 15 journals including 5 IEEE Transactions and a 
guest editor for 10 special issues for 9 journals including 2 IEEE 
Transactions. He has organized several international 
conferences and workshops and has also served as a program 
committee member for several major international 
conferences such as INFOCOM, GLOBECOM, ICC, IPDPS, and 
ICPP.

Summary
Understanding protein structures is vital to determining the function of a protein and its 
interaction with DNA, RNA and enzyme. The information about its conformation can provide 
essential information for drug design and protein engineering. While there are over a million 
known protein sequences, only a limited number of protein structures are experimentally 
determined. Hence, prediction of protein structures from protein sequences using computer 
programs is an important step to unveil proteins’ three dimensional conformation and 
functions. As a result, prediction of protein structures has profound theoretical and practical 
influence over biological study. The explanation of how a decision is made during prediction 
is also important for improving protein structure prediction and guiding the “wet 
experiments”. In this talk, we will show how to use machine learning methods to improve the 
accuracy of protein structure prediction and to interpret prediction results. We will report 
our research on using neural networks, Support Vector Machines combined with Decision Tree 
and Association Rule for protein structure prediction, rule extraction and prediction 
interpretation. Evaluation and comparisons of various prediction and rule extraction systems 
will be presented and future research direction in this area will also be identified.
