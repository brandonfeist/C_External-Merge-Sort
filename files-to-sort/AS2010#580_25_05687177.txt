Abstract—Association rule mining makes interesting 
associations and/or correlations among large sets of data. 
Those associations can be refined as decision rules to be used 
and stored in a knowledge base system. In this paper, an 
approach based on association rule and knowledge base is 
proposed and implemented in the fault diagnosis of a 
transformer system. According to the features of association 
rule, the Apriori algorithm is adopted and modified to generate 
decision rules from power transformer information for 
building knowledge base, then the rules can be refined to 
diagnose the fault of the transformer through reasoning, and a 
prototype system is developed. This approach based on 
association rule is described in detail and the application is 
illustrated by an example. A comparison with the IEC 
(International Electrotechnical Commission) three-ratio 
method shows the proposed method can provide better 
accuracy in performance.

I. INTRODUCTION
The power transformer is a major apparatus in a power 
system. Transformer faults have caused huge economic 
losses and brought about adverse social impacts in the past.  
Early diagnosis to detect the incipient faults is necessary to 
avoiding catastrophic failures and costly outages.  
To a large extent, the gas component and content 
dissolved in the transformer oil indicate the insulation aging 
and fault degree of the transformer, so the diagnosis of oil-
immersed transformers using the dissolved gas analysis 
(DGA) technique has been well accepted and widely used, 
and various methods applied for the DGA have been 
developed to interpret DGA results such as IEC ratio code[1] 
and the Rogers method [2], their limitation is that the 
predefined criteria are established upon empirical studies. In 
some cases, measured gas concentrations or ratios may be 
incomplete and thus do not fit within the predefined criteria. 
As a result, faults that occur inside transformers may not be 
identifiable. Other methods include rough sets theory [3,4],  
fuzzy theory [5,6], support vector machine [7], artificial 
neural network [8]-[11], Bayesian network [12], grey 
relational analysis [13], extension theory [14], fuzzy entropy 
[15], Case-based Reasoning Theory [16], decision tree [17], 
Kernel-Based Possibilistic Clustering [18], Expert System 
[19] and hybrid methods [20]-[24], all of these methods have 
been developed to improve diagnosis accuracies. However, 
these methods sometimes fail to determine the fault type, and 
the workers onsite often use different methods or other 
related information about the transformer to do such judge 
fault. Therefore, exploring new ways to resolve this early 
warning problem is still a challenge.  
Association rule mining (ARM) is one of the data 
mining techniques used to extract hidden knowledge from 
data sets, which can be used by an organization's decision 
makers to improve overall profit [25]. An ARM-based DGA 
approach [26] has been presented to fault diagnosis of 
power transformers, the result shows the approach is 
capable of generating a number of meaningful association 
rules and can achieve higher fault diagnosis accuracy, but 
owing to small number of samples used, more experiments 
are expected to examine it.  
ARM-based methods are applied in many fields. For 
customer relationship management (CRM), the technical 
analysis of customer using association rules can show the 
buying behavior, so that the managers of supermarket can 
adjust the layout of products to improve their services and 
profits. In the financial field, association rules technology is 
used in banking, securities, insurance, etc. and has 
discovered some important rules to support business 
decisions. In addition, the association rules technique also 
applies to the life sciences, information technology, 
industrial control, network security and so on.

For an oil-immersed power transformer, during the past 
forty years, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) has become 
universally accepted as the premier diagnostic tool for 
location of incipient faults in transformers with an 
assumption based on the idea that the gases produced during 
normal operation of oil filled circuit breakers (OCB) or load 
tap changers (LTC) would be more significant than gases 
produced by a fault process such as contact overheating. 
Therefore, there should be some association between the 
fault (the working state) and the dissolved gases.  
In this study, we not only examine the diagnosis accuracy 
of ARM-based DGA approach [26], also we focus on how to 
incorporate knowledge base with ARM-based DGA to build 
a fault diagnosis system. This ARM-based approach consists 
of a rule discovery method modified by the Apriori 
algorithm [27] and a rule-based knowledge system [28, 29] 
for diagnosis of the power transformer fault. A comparison 
with the IEC three-ratio method is implemented to validate 
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A knowledge 
base is established for incorporating more useful rules. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces 
the concepts and notions of information tables, association 
rule and knowledge base. Based on these basic concepts and 
notions, Section III presents an association rule and 
knowledge-base approach, including how to pre-process the 
data, how to modify the Apriori algorithm to generate rules 
and refine them, and how to use rules to diagnose the fault of 
a transformer. In Section IV, a case based example illustrates 
the effectiveness of the proposed association rule approach in 
comparison with IEC three-ratio method. Conclusions and 
future work are provided in Section V. 
II. BASIC NOTIONS
A. Information tables and decision tables 
In general, an information table is a system to express 
knowledge which can be used to represent and process 
knowledge in machine learning, data mining and other 
related fields.  
The definitions of information table and decision table 
have been described in [27].   
A decision table is a special case of an information table.  
A decision table can be seen as a special and important 
knowledge expression system. It shows that, when some 
conditions are satisfied, decisions, actions, operations, or 
controls can be made. Decision attributes in a decision table 
may, or may not, be unique. In the latter case, the decision 
table can be converted to one with unique decision 
attributes. Therefore, in this paper, we assume that there is 
only one decision attribute. 
In this paper, an information table has the form of a 
decision table with condition attributes C, including the key 
gases (e.g. hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), ethene (C2H6), 
ethylene (C2H4), acetylene (C2H2)) and decision attributes D
called “the working state”. This table contains the fault 
records as raw data for extracting rules for diagnosis.  
B. Association rule  
Let D, the task-relevant data be a set of database 
transactions where each transaction T is a set of items where 
each transaction is associated with an identifier, called TID.
Let A be a set of itemsets.  
An association rule is an implication of the form A => B,
where A ?I, B ?I, and A?B = ?  . The rule A => B
holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the 
percentage of transactions in D that contain A?B. This is 
taken to be the probability, P (A?B). The rule A => B has 
confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of 
transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is 
taken to be the conditional probability, P(B|A). That is, 
support (A=>B) = P(A?B), confidence (A=>B) = P(B|A).
Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold 
(min_sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min_conf) 
are called strong rules. If an itemset satisfies minimum 
support, then it is a frequent itemset.  
Apriori [27] is a classical algorithm to find association 
rules of item-set, which mines frequent itemsets by using a 
circulatory method to search frequent itemsets that produces 
(k+1)-item-sets from k-item-sets. After scanning the 
database, the algorithm begins to circulate. Each time, it 
connects two (k-1) itemsets, and produces frequent k-
itemsets after the riddling of Apriori property, that is “each 
subsets of the frequent itemsets also should be frequent” as 
well as the minimum support degree. The Apriori ends till 
the frequent itemsets can’t be produced.  
The procedure using Apriori algorithm can be described 
as follows:  
For each frequent item-sets L, produces all subsets. 
For each non-null subset S of L, generates an association 
rule “s? (l-s)”, if it's confidence degree is not less than 
min_conf.  
This is the classic algorithm for association rules. In this 
paper, we modify this method in order to build the 
knowledge base of an expert system.  
C. Knowledge base  
Knowledge base is a product of artificial intelligence 
and database technology, also a collection of knowledge and 
data. The keys to the development of technology are the 
knowledge acquisition, knowledge storage and 
representation, knowledge reasoning. 
1) Knowledge acquisition: Knowledge acquisition is a 
process whereby the knowledge from external knowledge 
sources is converted to the knowledge-based system. The 
object of knowledge acquisition, including the knowledge of 
domain experts and other relevant knowledge, must go 
through a refining process to improve problem-solving 
abilities. 
The means of knowledge acquisition usually contains 
two methods, which are interactive access and natural 
language acquisition. In this paper, the rules will be 
obtained by association rule, and then processed to become 
knowledge by a domain expert. 
The rules above are based on support and confidence 
which are objective assessment of conditions. These rules 
must be processed by subjective evaluation with domain 
knowledge, to then become useful knowledge.  
738 2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications
After knowledge acquisition, the rules can be stored in 
the knowledge base, and then used to diagnose by 
reasoning. 
2) Knowledge storage and representation: To place the 
knowledge into the knowledge Base, it needs a variable 
table and the rule table established. 
• Variable table: In this study, we choose H2, CH4,
C2H6, C2H4, C2H2 as the variables of the knowledge 
base, more variables can be added. 
• Rule table: Through establishing rule table, we can 
carry reasoning process by matching the rules with 
the facts (the variable bound values). 
The representation of knowledge contains the first order 
predicates logic, production rule for semantic network, 
production rule representation, and frame theory 
representation and so on. In this study, production rule 
representation is the best choice to express the knowledge. 
The form of this method is: P?Q.
Variable is the basic unit of the rules. In a relational 
database, each variable is a record in the table, and the 
attributes are the fields in the database. The fields are as 
shown in Table I. 
TABLE I. FIELDS OF VARIABLE TABLE 
Fields Type Explain 
VariableID Integer Number of variables 
Chinesename Text Chinese name of variables 
Englishname Text English name, Represent the variables in the

Max Float The max of variable values 
Min Float The min of variable values 
H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H2, C2H6 are the variables with No. 0, 
1, 2, 3 and 4. Max and Min denote the maximal value and 
minimal value, the gas data between Max and Min is valid. 
Rule table is the basis for problem solving, and their 
knowledge of the integrity, consistency, accuracy, 
flexibility, and the rationality of knowledge organization, 
has an important impact on the operating efficiency of the 
system. The fields of the rule table are shown in Table II.  
3)Knowledge reasoning: In this study, we use forward 
reasoning for inference. After the user inputs the gas values 
of a new power transformer, the reasoning process is as 
follows.  
First, bind corresponding variables  with these values by 
searching the variable table (Table I) with the known facts.  
Secondly, match antecedents of each rule (Table II) 
against known facts to produce a set of applicable rules. 
Finally, choose one applicable rules to apply (e.g. first 
rule which produces new facts), adding new facts to the 
fact-base.

III. THE PROPOSED APPROACH BASED ON ASSOCIATION 
RULE AND KNOWLEDGE BASE
In this section, a proposed approach based on association 
rule and knowledge base is described, and the procedure of 
the approach is given in detail.  
To use association rules for transformer fault diagnosis, 
we need to choose the most representative attributes of 
variables and collect data records, then pre-process them to 
be suitable for using ARM. Refined rules generated by 
ARM will be stored in the knowledge base, and when a new 
power transformer’s DGA record is provided, the rules in 
knowledge will be used to diagnose the working state of the 
power transformer by reasoning. The workflow chart of the 
approach is shown in Fig.1. 
Figure 1  The workflow chart 
Some steps are detailed as follows. 
A. Pre-process data 
In the real world, incomplete, noisy, and inconsistent 
data are common in the data we wish to analyze, so the first 
thing we should do is data pre-processing. 
Data pre-processing includes data cleaning, data 
integration, data transformation, and data reduction [30]. 
Data reduction obtains a reduced representation of the 
data set that is much smaller in volume, yet produces the 
same (or almost the same) analytical results. There are a 
number of strategies for data reduction, such as data cube 
aggregation, attribute subset selection, dimensionality 
reduction, numerosity reduction, and discretization can be 
used to obtain a reduced representation of the data while 
minimizing the loss of information content. Data 
discretization is a form of data reduction that is very useful 
for the automatic generation of concept hierarchies from 
numerical data. 
Data discretization techniques can be used to reduce the 
number of values for a given continuous attribute by 
dividing the range of the attribute into intervals. Interval 
labels can then be used to replace actual data values. 
2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications 739
Replacing numerous values of a continuous attribute by a 
small number of interval labels thereby reduces and 
simplifies the original data. This leads to a concise, easy-to-
use, knowledge-level representation of mining results. 
In this study, we will use a rough set and boolean 
reasoning approach [31] to solve this of real value attributes 
quantity problem, the approach has been verified for its 
ability of improving classification and accepted widely in 
practice.
The values of each gas are divided into several intervals 
and different gases have different number of intervals.  
B. Generate Rules by Modified Apriori algorithm 
In the Apriori algorithm, two frequent (k-1)-item are 
usually linked if they have the same front (k-2) items. For 
example, from link “1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 4.2, 5.2, 6.1” and “1.3, 
2.1, 3.1, 4.2, 5.1, 6.1”, we can get “1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 4.2, 5.1, 
5.2, 6.1”. However, this is not, in fact, reasonable, because 
“5.1” and “5.2” are two possible values of the same 
attribute,so they can’t exist simultaneously.  In our 
approach, we modify the link rules, if  two frequent (k-1)-
item have the same front (k-2) items and their (k-1)th items 
aren’t possible values of the same attribute, we link them. 
After the linking work and the set of the min_sup, we get 
the frequent k-itemsets which satisfies both min_conf and 
min_sup. From the above example, we get the frequent 5-
itemsets finally, as shown in Table III. 
TABLE III. EXAMPLE: THE FREQUENT 5-ITEMSETS
Item Support 
1.5, 2.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 4 
1.5, 3.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 5 
1.6, 2.2, 3.2, 4.3, 6.2 6 
1.6, 2.2, 4.3, 5.5, 6.2 4 
1.6, 2.3, 3.3, 4.3, 6.1 5 
1.6, 2.3, 3.4, 4.3, 6.1 6 
1.6, 2.3, 4.3, 5.2, 6.1 5 
1.6, 3.2, 4.3, 5.4, 6.2 4 
2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.5, 6.2 4 
2.2, 3.2, 4.3, 5.5, 6.2 4 
2.3, 3.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 6 
2.3, 3.4, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 4 
In the classic association algorithm, for all non-null 
subsets of frequent itemsets L and each nominal subset S,
we produce an association rule “s? (l-s)” if its confidence 
degree is not less than min_conf. 
For the knowledge base, the expected result by ARM is 
that these rules with some condition attributes are contained 
in antecedents with a decision attribute in consequents, but 
not all of the association rules like this. We modified this 
part of Apriori to obtain these expected rules. According to 
the important feature that the non-frequent itemsets’ subset 
is also non-frequent, we only need to calculate the 
confidence degree of the subset except for the consequent of 
decision rule. For example, to the frequent itemsets “1.5, 
2.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1”, we only need to calculate the confidence 
degree of “1.5, 2.3, 4.3, 5.4”, that is, s= “1.5, 2.3, 4.3, 5.4” 
(Because 6.1 is the consequent of decision rule). So, when it 
satisfies the rule that its confidence is more than min_conf. 
we can produce the rule s? (l-s), i.e. “1.5, 2.3, 4.3, 
5.4?6.1”. 
C. Refine Rules and add rules for knowledge base 
In Section B, through the ARM process, we find a lot of 
rules, but not every rule is appropriate, so we need to check 
them to keep the desired rules. In this study, this post 
process work is undertaken by a domain expert or 
knowledge worker. 
The rules generated by ARM will not be enough for 
diagnosis, and some empirical rules from on-site inspection 
are also useful, so using a knowledge base could be more 
extendable and feasible in practice, as we can input those 
empirical rules into the knowledge base. 
D. Diagnose fault using rules 
The reasoning is mainly achieved by rule matching. 
Once a DGA record data or related data of a power 
transformer is provided, these values will be bound with 
corresponding variables and enter the reasoning process 
described in the knowledge reasoning section. After that, the 
fault type of the provided power transformer will be 
determined. 
IV. A CASE STUDY
A case study using the proposed approach is presented 
in this paper, including fault and normal data of power 
transformers, 127 training data sets is selected randomly for 
generating rules, and other 73 test data sets are used to 
validate the proposed approach using the obtained rules. 
As we mentioned above, DGA records are chosen in this 
study, including the five dissolved gases: H2, CH4, C2H6,
C2H4, C2H2. Table IV shows an excerpt of raw data. 
TABLE IV. AN EXCERPT OF RAW DATA
Discretization is the main task in processing data.  Using 
the rough set and boolean reasoning approach (described 
detailly in [31]), we implement discretization function based 
on a toolkit named ROSETTA [32] in our prototype system. 
By this system, H2 can be divided into 8 intervals, denoted 
as 1.1-1.8 and CH4?C2H6?C2H4?C2H2 can be divided 
into several intervals. Different gases have different number 
of intervals. The discretization results are shown in Table V.

We used the modified Apriori algorithm to generate 
rules. For each “working state”, we adjust the support and 
the confidence till we can get at least one rule or more when 
the support or confidence changes in the downward 
direction. During this process, a domain expert evaluates the 
generated rules and decides the rules to be kept by their 
domain knowledge and empirical evidence. In this study, we 
set min_sup = 0.03 and min_conf = 0.6, the refined rules are 
shown in Table VI.

All of the refined rules are placed in the knowledge base 
waiting for use. Once a new set of key gas values of a power 
transformer is provided, we can diagnose the working state 
of the power transformer by matching the rules in the 
knowledge base. Fig.2. shows an interface of fault diagnosis. 
Figure 2 Fault diagnosis based on knowledge base 
To validate the proposed approach, we used the IEC 
three-ratio method to diagnose the fault of power 
transformers with the same test data sets. The IEC three-
ratio method is widely accepted and used in on-site work, so 
the comparison basically can show the performance of the 
proposed method. The proposed approach using the refined 
rules in Table VI diagnosed 73 test data sets and the IEC 
three-ratio method also is used for comparision, the results 
shown in Table VII. 
From Table VII, we can see that the proposed approach 
using association rule achieved higher accuracy in each fault 
type, especially for hyperthermia and superheating, the 
accuracy reached 100%, although it’s expected to be 
identified by more experiments.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Power transformer fault is a complicated problem and 
the development of related research is important. This poses 
a challenge, for which we proposed an approach based on 
ARM and the knowledge base. In the approach, the 
modified Apriori algorithm is used to generate rules, and 
then the rules are refined by a domain expert and stored in a 
knowledge base. When a new power transformer’s data is 
provided, the rules in knowledge base will be searched and 
2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications 741
matched to diagnose the fault. The results of comparison 
with the IEC three-ratio method show that the use of 
association rules for fault diagnosis is feasible and generates 
better performance. Moreover, the application of the 
knowledge base is useful to incorporate empirical results of 
field experts or other resources. 
Our future work includes developing some methods to 
assist domain expert to refine the rules process, and to find 
rule selection technologies to use the rules in the knowledge 
base appropriately and solve the rule contradictions. Future 
work will consider more related information and collect 
more fault records about power transformers; so that we can 
better improve the result of ARM.
