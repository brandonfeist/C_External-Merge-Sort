Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to overcome
the difficulty and complexity in detecting and
predicting e-banking phishing website. We proposed
an intelligent resilient and effective model that is
based on using association and classification Data
Mining algorithms. These algorithms were used to
characterize and identify all the factors and rules in
order to classify the phishing website and the
relationship that correlate them with each other. We
implemented six different classification algorithm and
techniques to extract the phishing training data sets
criteria to classify their legitimacy. We also compared
their performances, accuracy, number of rules
generated and speed. The rules generated from the
associative classification model showed the
relationship between some important characteristics
like URL and Domain Identity, and Security and
Encryption criteria in the final phishing detection rate.
The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility
of using Associative Classification techniques in real
applications and its better performance as compared
to other traditional classifications algorithms.
1. Introduction
Phishing websites is the process of enticing people
to visit fraudulent ebanking websites and persuading
them to enter identity information such as usemames
and passwords. The information is then used to
impersonate victims in order to empty their bank
accounts, run fraudulent auctions, launder money, and
so on. The word phishing from the phrase "website
phishing" is a variation on the word "fishing". The
idea is that bait is thrown out with the hopes that a user
will grab it and bite into it just like the fish. The
motivation behind this study is to create a resilient and
978-1-4244-7003-7/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 9
effective method that uses Data Mining algorithms and
tools to detect e-banking phishing websites in an
Artificial Intelligent technique. Associative and
classification algorithms can be very useful in
predicting Phishing websites. It can give us answers
about what are the most important e-banking phishing
website characteristics and indicators and how they
relate with each other. Comparing between different
Data Mining Classification and Association methods
and techniques is also a goal of this investigation. The
paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the
literature review, Section 3 shows data mining
phishing approach, Section 4 shows the theory and
methodology of the research, Section 5 shows the
utilization of the DM classification techniques, Section
6 reveals the experimental results and then conclusions
and future work are given in Section 7.
2. Literature Review
A report by Gartner estimated the costs at $1,244 per
victim, an increase over the $257 they cited in a 2004
report [1]. In 2007, Moore and Clayton estimated the
number of phishing victims by examining web server
logs. They estimated that 311,449 people fall for
phishing scams annually, costing around 350 million
dollars [2]. There are several promising defending
approaches to this problem reported earlier. One
approach is to stop phishing at the email level [3],
since most current phishing attacks use broadcast
email (spam) to lure victims to a phishing website.
Another approach is to use security toolbars. The
phishing filter in IE7 [4] is a toolbar approach with
more features such as blocking the user's activity with
a detected phishing site. A third approach is to visually
differentiate the phishing sites from the spoofed
legitimate sites. Dynamic Security Skins [5] proposes
to use a randomly generated visual hash to customize
the browser window or web form elements to indicate
the successfully authenticated sites. A fourth approach
is two-factor authentication , which ensures that the
user not only knows a secret but also presents a
security token [6]. Many industrial antiphishing
products use toolbars in Web browsers, but some
researchers have shown that security tool bars don't
effectively prevent phishing attacks. Another approach
is to employ certification, e.g., Microsoft spam privacy
[7]. A variant of web credential is to use a database or
list published by a trusted party, where known
phishing web sites are blacklisted. The weaknesses of
this approach are its poor scalability and its timeliness.
The newest version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer
supports Extended Validation (EV) certificates,
coloring the URL bar green and displaying the name
of the company. However, a recent study found that
EV certificates did not make users less fall for
phishing attacks [8].
3. Phishing Data Mining Approach
3.1. Phishing Characteristics and Indicators
There are many characteristics and indicators that
can distinguish the original legitimate ebanking
website from the phishing one. We managed to gather
27 phishing features and indicators and clustered them
into six Criteria (URL & Domain Identity, Security &
Encryption, Source Code & Java script, Page Style &
Contents, Web Address Bar and Social Human
Factor), and each criteria has its own phishing
components. The full list is shown in table I which is
used later on our analysis and methodology study.
3.2 Why use Data Mining?
OM is the process of searching through large
amounts of data and picking out relevant information.
It has been described as "the nontrivial extraction of
implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful
information from large data sets [9]. Data mining tools
predict future trends and behaviors , allowing
businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven
decisions [10].
4. Theory and Methodology
4.1. Data Mining Techniques
The approach described here is to apply data mining
algorithms to assess e-banking phishing website risk
on the 27 characteristics and factors which stamp the
forged website. We utilized data mining classification
and association rule approaches in our new e-banking
phishing website detection model as shown in figure I
10
to find significant patterns of phishing characteristic or
factors in the e-banking phishing website archive data.
Particularly, we used a number of different existing
data mining association and classification techniques
including JRip, PART [II], PRISM [12] and C4.5
[13], CBA [14], MCAR [15] algorithms to learn and to
compare the relationships of the different phishing
classification features and rules. The experiments of
C4.5, RIPPER, PART and PRISM algorithms were
conducted using the WEKA software [16]. CBA and
MCAR experiments were conducted using an
implementation provided by the authors of [14], [15].

We used two web access archives, one from APWG
archive [17] and one from Phishtank archive [18]. We
managed to extract the whole 27 phishing security
features and clustered them to its 6 corresponding
criteria as mentioned before in table 1.
4.2. Website Phishing Training Data Sets
Two publicly available datasets were used to test our
implementation: the "phishtank" from the
phishtank.com [18] which is considered one of the
primary phishing-report collates both the 2007 and
2008 collections. The PhishTank database records the
URL for the suspected website that has been reported,
the time of that report, and sometimes further detail
such as the screenshots of the website, and is publicly
available. The Anti Phishing Working Group (APWG)
which maintains a "Phishing Archive" describing
phishing attacks dating back to September 2007 [3]. A
data set of 1006 phishing, suspicious and legitimate
ebanking websites is used in the study (412 row
phishing ebanking websites, 288 rows suspicious and
306 row of real ebanking websites for the legitimate
portion of the data set). In addition, 27 features are
used to train and test the classifiers. We used a series
of short scripts to programmatically extract the above
features, and store these in an excel sheet for quick
reference.
5. DM Classification Techniques
5.1. Associative Classification Algorithms
The practical part of this comparative study utilizes
six different common OM classification algorithms
(C4.5, JRip, PART, PRISM, CBA and MCAR). Our
choice of these methods is based on the different
strategies they used in learning rules from data sets.
The C4.5 algorithm [13] employs divide and conquer
approach, and the RIPPER algorithm uses separate and
conquer approach. The choice of PART algorithm is
based on the fact that it combines both approaches to
generate a set of rules. PRISM is a classification rule
which can only deal with nominal attributes and
doesn't do any pruning. CBA algorithm employs
association rule mining [14] to learn the classifier and
then adds a pruning and prediction steps. Finally,
MCAR algorithm consists of two phases: rules
generation and a classifier builder. In the first phase,
MCAR scans the training data set to discover frequent
single items, and then recursively combines the items
generated to produce items involving more attributes.
MCAR then generates ranks and stores the rules. In
the second phase, the rules are used to generate a
classifier by considering their effectiveness on the
training data set [IS].
5.2. MCAR Phishing Model Approach
Associative Classification is a special case of
association rule mining in which only the class
attribute is considered in the rule's right-hand-side
11
(consequent), for example A, B -) Y, Then A, B
must be input items attributes and Y must be the
output class attribute. The attribute values for all our
input items which represent the six ebanking phishing
features and criteria ranged between three fuzzy set
values (Genuine, Doubtful and Legitimate) which we
measured before in our previous paper using Fuzzy
Logic [19] taking into consideration all the input fuzzy
variables for all criteria different components as
shown in Table I. The output class attribute of our e-
banking phishing website rate is one of these values
(Very Legitimate, Legitimate, Suspicious, Phishy or
Very Phishy). Example of the training phishing data
sets to be classified is shown in Table 2.

3 D D G F D G Suspicious
4 F D G D F D Phishy
5 D F F D F r Very Phishy
*
(f =(fenlline f)= Doubtful F= Fraud
To derive a set of class association rules from the
training data set, it must satisfy certain user-constraints,
i.e support and confidence thresholds. Generally, in
association rule mining, any item that passes MinSupp
is known as a frequent item.
We recorded the prediction accuracy and the number
of rules generated by the classification algorithms and
the new associative classification approaches we used
in Table 3 and Table 4 respectively. Error rate
comparative chart is shown in figure 2.

There is a significant relation between the two
phishing website criteria's (URL & Domain Identity)
and (Security & Encryption) for identifying ebanking
phishing website. Also we found insignificant trivial
in~uence of the (Page Style & Content) criteria along
with (Social Human Factor) criteria for identifying e-
banking phishing websites. The number of rules
extracted from the PRISM algorithms is the highest
since it doesn't do any pruning process. Associative
classifiers produce more accurate classification models
and rules than traditional classification algorithms.
The experiments also demonstrate the feasibility of
using Associative Classification techniques in real
appli~ations involving large databases. Finally, the
expenment results showed that the proposed
associative classification MCAR algorithm
outperformed all other traditional classifications in
terms of accuracy and speed (Err. Rate: 12.622 %)
since it requires only one phase to discover frequent
items and rules.

6. Conclusion and Future Work
The associative classification data mmmg e-
banking phishing website model showed the
significance importance of the phishing website two
criteria's (URL & Domain Identity) and (Security &
Encryption) with insignificant trivial influence of
some other criteria like 'Page Style & content' and
' So.cial Human Factor ' in the final phishing rate,
which can help us in building website phishing
detection system. The experiments indicate that
associative classification algorithm MCAR is highly
competitive when compared with other traditional
classifications in term of prediction accuracy and
efficiency. As for future work, we want to use
different pruning methods like lazy pruning [15]
which discards rules that incorrectly classify training
