Abstract—In order to make a marketing campaign effective, 
the business must analyze the spending behavior of his 
customers and know the best promotional time period.  
However, extracting these data manually is a time consuming 
and an inefficient task. Thanks to the current internet and 
wireless technologies together with existing data mining tools, 
our system is able to automate the data mining process 
efficiently with instant business intelligence built into it.  In this 
paper, we introduce an Enterprise Marketing Campaign 
Automation (EMCA) system that can provide data for 
businesses to instantly assemble them for determining effective 
and accurate marketing campaign strategy. Through market 
basket analysis, both the business and customers benefited by 
having a recommended list of “most likely to purchase” 
products being generated instantly.  By generating a mailing 
list targeted to a specific group of buyers with reference to 
their buying habits can reduce marketing cost by just mailing 
the promotional items to the specific group of buyers. Being 
able to predict the low and peak sales seasons will enable the 
business to plan ahead with good marketing campaign 
strategies for consumers to have a more enjoyable shopping 
experience!

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In this “Information Explosive” world, we, as consumers, 
are constantly and extensively being exposed to various kind 
of marketing campaign promotional items such as catalogue, 
pamphlets, flyer, brochures and so on either in hard or 
softcopy.  What would you do with all these promotional 
items? Most of the times, we may just browse through them 
and then put them aside.   How often do you make use of 
these promotional items or put in another words, how useful 
are they for you? Are they able to help you in making the 
right purchase at the right time?  Imagine a scenario at a 
grocery store where consumers come to purchase the 
products they require; the challenge of the grocery store 
would be to attract the buyers to buy the products they want 
and simultaneously consider buying other products which 
may be secondary to them at that time. So which products 
need to be highlighted for promotions? The grocery store 
must analyze the spending behavior of his customers, when 
is the peak sales period and so on. All these have to be 
acknowledged before extracting them for generation of a list 
of potential products to be placed in pamphlets catalogue, 
flyers and so on.  However, extracting these data manually is 
a time consuming and an inefficient task. Therefore, this data 
mining process has to be automated. Thanks to the current 
internet and wireless technologies, especially the 3G 
broadband service [3] which has enabled the cell phones, 
PDAs and many other mobile devices to be able to  transmit 
and receive huge amounts of data.  These technologies 
together with existing data mining tools, and the developers’ 
sense of creativity has enabled  data mining process to be 
automated efficiently with instant business intelligence built 
into the system as well. In this paper, we introduce an 
Enterprise Marketing Campaign Automation (EMCA) 
system that can provide data for businesses to instantly 
assemble them for determining effective and accurate 
marketing campaign strategy.  In addition, member buyers 
can log onto the websites through internet or mobile device 
to make a purchase. The buyers will also be provided with a 
list of related products recommended for purchase. 
II. BACKGROUND 
SAS [4] defines data mining as the process of sampling, 
exploring, modifying, modeling, and assessing large amounts 
of data to uncover previously unknown patterns, which can 
be utilized as a business advantage. And, among the data 
mining techniques such as decision tree, clustering, neural 
network, and Naïve Bayes, association rule [2] is perhaps the 
most common form of local-pattern discovery in 
unsupervised learning systems. Thus, it represents the best 
technique to be used in market basket analysis because as 
mentioned in [1] that the purchase of one product when 
another is purchased represents an association rule.  
According to [2], during market basket analysis, one 
common analysis is used to run against a transaction 
database to find sets of item that appear together in many 
transactions. The business can then make use of knowledge 
of these patterns to improve the placement of these items in 
the stores or on the layout of catalogue or web pages.   
After much in-depth studies and comparisons of features 
in some existing data mining software or tools such as SAS 
[4, 5], Microsoft tools [6, 7], the co-authors of this paper: 
Mohamad Fazli Abd Aziz and Siti Suhaily Hasan have 
decided to build the EMCA system under the Microsoft 
Second International Conference on Computer Research and Development

ASP.NET platform. Basically, the system consists of the 
front-end and back-end portions.  The front-end portion is 
built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 to provide the 
graphical user interface with the functionalities for both 
administrator and users such as login, browse products, 
create products, online purchase and so on.  As seen in  
Figure 1-EMCA system architecture, this EMCA system not 
only provides the market basket analysis feature, but also 
consists of 2 other features namely: targeted mailing, and 
sales prediction.  
As for the back-end database, Microsoft SQL Server 
2005 with its add-on services such as Analysis Services and 
Business Intelligence Development Studio are used for 
storage and data mining purposes. 
 With the creativities of the developers, this system 
provides online as well as mobile access to front-end users 
such as customers or potential buyers, as seen in Figure 2-
EMCA front-end web login for online users and Figure 3-
EMCA front-end mobile login for mobile access.  Due to 
security reason, the back-end users (administrative users) 
who require direct and read/write access to the database or 
data warehouse, are only allowed online access to the system 
as seen in Figure 4-EMCA back-end login. 
 All these three features can further enhance the timely, 
efficient, effective and accurate planning for marketing 
campaign. With these features, the data mining solutions 
require no separate follow-up actions by the users after the 
data mining process is completed.  This removes the need for 
the organization to hire additional business analyst to analyze 
the mining results as the results can be represented in an 
easy-to understand format.  It also eliminates the problem of 
having several versions of the same mining models as the 
mining model is shared in a centralized server.  This 
complies with the goal of data warehousing where in any 
single point in time, there should only be one single version 
of true data.

III. THE IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION 
The above mentioned features are built into the EMCA 
system using the data mining techniques such as association, 
decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and time series algorithms.  For 
market basket analysis, association rule is used.  In this 
algorithm, each attribute/value pair, for example,   
product/bicycle,  is considered as an item and an itemset is a 
combination of items in a single transaction. The algorithm 
scans through the dataset trying to find itemsets that tend to 
appear in many transactions.  However, in a database with 
large volumes of transactions, which are those items and 
itemsets that are the most appropriate for our market basket 
analysis? This relies on two parameters, support and 
confidence parameters. The support parameter defines how 
many transactions the itemset must appear before it is 
considered significant or in other words, how often it should 
occur in the database.  The confidence parameter determines 
the minimum probability before a rule can be considered; it 
measures the strength of the rule.  Generally, large 
confidence value and smaller support values are used. For 
example [1], if confidence is 100% and support is only 20% 
indicates that if antecedent A occurs, consequent B always 
occur, even though this association rule exists only in 20% of 
the transactions.  With this rule, it is still effective to target 
the promotional campaign to those consumers purchasing 
item A. As shown in Figure 5-EMCA list of recommended 
products (mobile) that by using this algorithm, our EMCA 
system is capable of providing instant product 
recommendations to customers so as to improve their 
shopping experience.  For the business part, they are able to 
determine which products to be included for promotion 
instantly while planning a marketing campaign.

For the target mailing analysis, our system makes use of 
the decision tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms since both 
these algorithms support classification and work well for 
predictive modeling.   In building a model, the decision tree 
algorithm examines how each input attribute in the dataset 
affects the result of the predicted attribute, and then it uses 
the input attributes with the strongest relationship to create a 
series of splits called nodes.  If an input attribute is seen to 
cause the predicted attribute to favor one state over the other, 
a new node is added to the model.   
 
 
 
Figure 4.  EMCA back-end login. 
The model continues to grow and seeks to find a 
combination of attributes and their states that create a 
disproportionate distribution of states in the predicted 
attributes, therefore, allowing us to predict the outcome of 
the predicted attribute.  Naives Bayes algorithm on the other 
hand, calculates probabilities for each possible state of the 
input attribute.  Since these probabilities used to generate the 
model are calculated and stored during the processing of the 
cube, the results are returned quickly and making the model 
a good option for exploring data and for discovering how 
various input attributes are distributed in the different states 
of the predicted attribute.  
 As seen in Figure 6-EMCA campaign management that 
by using the Naives Bayes algorithm, our system is able to 
categorize the customers into groups not only based on their 
geographic areas, but also based on demographic 
information.  The results obtained from the analysis will 
enable the business to identify which customer will most 
likely to buy a product first based on his/her actual purchase 
history, and secondly making references to geographic and 
demographic information of existing customers who have 
actually bought the product.  This more focused and accurate 
way of generating mailing list shall reduce the marketing 
cost by targeting the promotion to a specific group of 
customers according to their preferences.

As for the sales prediction feature, our system makes use 
of the time series algorithm to create model that can be used 
to predict continuous variables over time.  For example, you 
can choose one or more variables to predict, but they must be 
continuous and can have only one case series for each model. 
The case series identifies the location in a series, such as the 
date when looking at sales over a length of several months or 
years.  As shown in Figure 7-EMCA sales forecasting, that 
by using this algorithm, our system is able to find patterns 
from existing product sales information and predict how the 
sales will progress in the future.  These results obtained will 
enable the business to plan their marketing strategy ahead 
effectively before the low or peak sales seasons occur.  
Promoting the right product at the right time to the right 
people indeed makes a great difference in sales and market 
shares.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT 
As can be seen above that the EMCA system can, indeed 
help businesses to instantly carry out analysis for 
determining effective and accurate marketing campaign 
strategy. Through market basket analysis, both the business 
and customers benefited by having a recommended list of 
“most likely to purchase” products being generated instantly. 
This helps the business to promote the right products to the 
right customers.  As for the customers with more accurate 
information, they are able to make better purchase decision. 
By generating a mailing list targeted to a specific group of 
buyers with reference to their buying habits benefited to both 
the business and the consumers. The business can reduce 
marketing cost by just mailing the promotional items to the 
specific group of buyers while the consumers gained from 
not receiving unnecessary and un-related promotional items. 
Being able to predict the low and peak sales seasons will 
enable the business to plan ahead with good marketing 
campaign strategies.  
Perhaps with a well planned marketing campaign 
strategy, the consumers shall have more enjoyable shopping 
experiences! As no system is perfect, one suggestion for 
future improvement to EMCA is to enable the front-end 
module to be able to send SMS and MMS regarding 
promotions to the customers; not just emails only.  Currently, 
EMCA system is built under the Microsoft ASP.NET 
platform with Microsoft software and tools. Perhaps in the 
not too distant future, it can be integrated with other software 
or tools in other platforms as well.
