Abstract—to mine popular accessed Web pages items and find 
out their association rule from the Web server Log database 
for junior users providing recommendation service. A novel 
GEP-based algorithm for mining multiple-layers association 
rules was presented. Firstly, takes generalizing technology as a 
way to value fitness function in GEP (Gene Expression 
Programming). Then, relying on the significant self-search 
function of GEP, the most optional species was evolved. The 
frequent items and association rules in the next deeper layers 
can be mined by using traditional support-confidence method 
in sub-database. The algorithm improves on the frame of 
traditional association rule mining and uses a new evolutionary 
algorithm for mining association rules. Finally, the validity and 
efficiency of the method are presented by the application in the 
paper.

i. Introduction 
The WUM (Web Usage Mining) mines the characteristics 
and performance of the behavioral patterns of users when 
the users access to Web which interact with server [1]. An 
important application of the current WUM is a personalized 
Web services for personalized recommendation system [2]. It 
is an important research in personalized recommendation 
method for mining popular accessed Web pages items and 
find out their association rule from the Web server Log 
database for junior users. The literature [3] [4] proposed 
some algorithms and recommendation system from mining 
frequent association rules. In recent years, the evolutionary 
algorithm is used for mining association rules, which 
becomes hot topic. The literature [5] discussed how to apply 
genetic algorithm to the process of mining association rules 
in a large database. The literature [6] proposed how to use 
PAGEP (mining Predicate Association by GEP) algorithm 
for mining generalized association rules. These methods can 
solve for mining association rules in the same layer in the 
WUM of multilevel association rule, but the capabilities for 
mining association rules between layers in multi-layer 
association rules seem inadequate. This is because of: (1) 
the above methods encode simply with a single character 
encoding to the items, but not address code of the item in 
different layers and not make coding a good explanation. (2) 
Some of the above algorithms generate any individual by 
scanning database, so a large time and space overhead. The 
literature [7] proposed that you can tap into the frequent 
item-sets after the abstract by generalizing a large 
transaction databases. After getting a sufficient degree if 
abstraction to support frequent items, the GEP-based 
multiple-layers association rule mining algorithm, which is 
used to split the database and find out the common 
characteristics in sub -database, and then mining the lower 
frequent item-sets. Gene Expression Programming (Gene 
Expression Programming, GEP) is the development of new 
concept combines the advantages of both based on genetic 
algorithm (Genetic Algorithms, GAs) and Genetic 
Programming (Genetic Programming, GP), more flexible 
than the genetic algorithm codes, have a stronger ability to 
solve problems [8][9]. The literature [7] combined with the 
generalization technique to the GEP, we can guide the 
direction of the evolution of GEP individuals to generate

more optimum individual and then scan sub-database which 
greatly reduce the time and space overhead and improve the 
capacity of mining association rules between layers. 
ii.  Related works  
A. The multiple-level association rule mining 
Association rules, also known as association models, 
association rule mining found an interesting correlation or 
related relationship between item-sets in large data. Mining 
algorithms first is put forward and research by the Agrawal, 
the pruning algorithm based on frequent item-sets is put 
forward by Agrawal et , which is divided into two stages, 
first , identify all the frequent item-sets, and then frequent 
item-sets generated the strong association rules, these rules 
must satisfy the minimum support S (support) and minimum 
confidence C(confidence). Mining association rules problem 
is generated over S and C were given by the user's minimum 
support and minimum confidence of association rules that is 
to produce strong rules. However, for many applications, the 
strong association rules between data items in the lower or 
the original abstraction layer is difficult to find. Mining 
association rules between multiple layers have enough 
sufficient flexibility is an important area of data mining 
Data. Association rules mining in a number of layers called 
multi-level association rules [7]. Multilevel association rules 
in accordance with the rules involved level can be divided 
into the same level association rules and association rules 
between layers. At present, the mining of multilevel 
association rules basically follow the "support - confidence" 
framework and concentrated on the same layer associated 
mining, this mining association rules method apply to the 
mining between layers, capacity of what is clearly 
insufficient. This method in the paper can improve the 
traditional multi-level association rule mining framework.  
B. Based on the abstract generalization frequent item-sets 
mining  
Definition 1 (Abstract Frequency Items, AFItems) The 
items in the item-sets of the library is a database property 
value, property value in data processing can be carried out 
along dimension for the generalization, after a 
generalization to the top, the top-level item-sets is frequent, 
and we call these frequent item-sets of the top to AFItems.  
This step of generalization, with such as DB2, SQL 
Server and other database tools, can be most easily 
completed in the algorithm, we say that this step is 
generalizing (TS). The experiment in this paper Uses 
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services deal with the 
generalization process. Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis 
Services provide the tools that analysis data warehouse and 
data mart stored data, SQL Server 2005 Data 
Transformation Services (DTS) is a Microsoft SQL Server 
2005 Analysis Services for developing components, data 
conversion services support to extract data from a data 
source, and carry out complex data conversion from time to 
time and store conversion of data have been summarized in 
another data source. It can generalize and aggregate in 
multiple dimensions of database.   
 Generalization play an important role in the complex 
database, usually indiscriminate mining in large databases 
could lead to a large number of "rules", but actually the 
number of rules are not interested in a particular user, if 
there is a clear depicts before the excavation, it is said that 
we hope that the abstract frequent item-sets, they can cover 
most of the transaction. The benefits of which is: develop 
the road map in the macro and provide the basis for a large 
search space, reduce blindness of searcher, at the same , the 
lower frequent item-sets that is not belong the abstract 
frequent item sets will be pruned off, this would be similar 
to the Agrawal’s pruning algorithm based on frequent 
item-sets.  
iii.  Algorithms for mining multilevel association rules  
A.  The fitness measure function  
The fitness value of GEP is used to measure each 
individual of populations in the optimization calculation, 
which may meet or help to find the fine level of the optimal 
solution. The MAGGEP(mining Multiple-layers Association 
rule using Generalizing- based GEP) algorithm used the 
following definition measure individual adaptability.  
Definition 2 Evaluation (T) by generalizing (TS): set a 
7069
transaction T = (I1, I2 ... ... .. Im, In), generalizing (TS) mine 
the General Mining frequent item-sets that is called AFItems, 
if the In of T can be generalized to AFItems, and In ? Im, 
then , fitness (T) = fitness (T) +U 
(U is a constant value, indicating a weight)     (1)  
B. Algorithm thinking depicts  
Step1: generalizing?TS?,referencing the literature [7] with 
the generalization Method based on the planning database 
mining, then obtaining AFItems;  
Step2: randomly generate initial population;  
Step3: evolve by GEP to the optimal population , get some 
better individuals;  
Step4: Every one of the population individuals will be 
scanned in the sub-database based on the basic framework 
of "support - confidence". The frequent items of individuals 
and association rules to meet the conditions can be 
outputted.

Comparison the MAGGEP algorithm with the genetic 
association rules algorithm in the literature [5] is easy to 
find: the MAGGEP is expert in expression domain of the 
attributes space and more extensive explanation; At the 
same time,  the MAGGEP algorithm compared with the 
genetic algorithm and the PAGEP algorithm[6], because 
there is a road map of searcher space by a generalization 
way and then reuse support - confidence framework, the 
time and space complexity of the MAGGEP algorithm 
significantly reduces greatly. If the number of generation of 
traditional genetic algorithm is N, then the scanning 
frequency number of the MAGGEP algorithm is the 
algorithm in the literature [9] 1 / N in scanning 
sub-database .Comparing the MAGGEP algorithm with the 
classical pruning algorithm, the scanning frequency and the 
number of transactions of the database reduce greatly. The 
710
MAGGEP algorithm is more suitable for mining multilevel 
association rules between different layers.  
iv. WUM experiment  
  In my experiment, each layer of the site is divided into 10 
themes and the association rules tap into the third 
layer .Then more than 10 * 10 * 10 pages were dig to find 
frequently visited pages and found to be associated. A larger 
web site can tap into a deeper layer. For understanding 
easily, the experiment taps to the third level only as a simple 
example.  
Through mongering and squashing similar transactions, then 
setting the value of S and C, We can easily tap into a 
relational based on generalizing (TS) as (2):  
Admissions Employment\ academic departments 
Remote   Support = 60%, Confident = 67.5%   (2) 
This abstract frequent item-set illustrates that during this 
period external users access Admissions Employment and 
academic departments frequently under the home page.  
A. Main parameters of GEP 
? Multiple genes encoding of GEP: each gene is called 
as a one-dimensional array of constant length, a gene 
represents an item, the two- dimensional array of fixed 
length form each chromosome, and the whole 
two-dimensional array represents a transaction. After 
specific operators transform item-sets element and 
transaction, and then form the search space. All the 
Chromosome encoding and decoding methods of 
individuals see in the literature [6] [8] [9] and so on. In 
a visit to transaction, home should be washed as noise; 
a web page was visited again in the same transaction 
that represents only one gene. Each page in a 
transaction can be encoded and decode at different 
levels, for example.1 (Fig 1) as follows: academic 
departments - the Faculty of Arts - Master and teacher 
(b-ba - bac) can be represented (& ~ bdf & baeg & & 
bac). e.g.Fig1. 
? Population size (M): algorithm uses the strategy of 
generalizing and partition in the database .The strategy 
can be generalized the Web log data of 10 days to 
AFItems and mine the Web log data of 1 day with GEP. 
Initial population generated randomly. It’s dissatisfied 
to set the too small initial population.  
? Genetic recombination (crossover) rate: this case is 
to mainly extract specific frequent item sets; the main 
genetic operator is mutation and Genetic 
recombination. In all of the genetic operation, the 
variation operation is better than the other operation, 
and the variation operation in performance is the best. 
B. Analysis of experimental results  
   Through the experiment, set the different S values and 
the operating parameters (e.g. table1), some statistically 
significant and obvious correlation between the frequent 
item-sets was extracted and analyzed. The results can be 
show in table2. Note, the experimental results used in the

Table 2: experiment performance analysis 
Table2 shows that: the three experiments all could better 
find frequent item-sets; test1 is the strongest in extracting 
association rules; The value of confidence in test2 and test3 
declines and decreases slope, indicating that the capability 
of association rules mining declines; as the same time, we 
observe a two-layers associate themes in the test1 and a 
three-layers associate themes in the test2 and test3.The 
levels of the layers are more abstract, the ability of 
association rules mined is the stronger by the algorithm. In 
accordance with characteristics of multi-level association 
rule mining .The experiment also demonstrated the 
limitations of the algorithm. 
v.   Conclusions 
Through a combination of database generalization 
technology, the MAGGEP algorithm for association rule 
mining applied to multi-layers. Next, this application will be 
integrated into real-time system model to recommend for 
junior users in Web Intelligence .Meanwhile, the GEP 
algorithm combined with the generalizing technology 
applies to sequential pattern mining also has research value. 
This article focuses on introducing this method, on such 
issues; the more the parameters setting of the GEP and 
comparative analysis of performance of the algorithm will 
be discussed in a separate paper.
