Abstract—In this paper, we design a new kind of patterns, 
named high transaction-weighted utility itemsets, which 
considers not only individual profits and quantities of the items 
in a transaction, but also the contribution of each transaction 
in a database. We also propose a two-phased mining algorithm 
to discover high transaction-weighted utility itemsets. The 
experimental results on synthetic datasets show the proposed 
approach has a good performance. 
Keywords: data mining; utility mining; two-phase mining; 
high utility itemsets; high transaction-weighted utility itemsets. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Mining association rules [1] is an important issue in the 
field of data mining due to its wide applications. Traditional 
association rules are, however, derived from frequent 
itemsets, which only consider the occurrence of items but do 
not reflect any other factors, such as price or profit. Chan et 
al. thus proposed the utility mining to solve the problem [3]. 
They considered both individual profits and quantities of 
products (items) in transactions, and used them to find out 
actual utility values of itemsets. Several other researches 
about utility mining were proposed in these years [5][6][7] 
[11][15][17][18][19]. 
Weighted mining has recently been proposed, in which 
transactions are attached with weighted values according to 
some criteria [3][10][12][13][16]. It is important because if 
the same significance is assumed for all the transactions in a 
database, some interesting association rules may not be 
found by traditional mining. However, the actual 
significance of an itemset cannot be easily recognized. 
In this study, we thus consider transaction weights and 
introduce a new kind of patterns, called high transaction-
weighted utility itemsets. The proposed patterns consider 
not only individual profits and quantities of products in 
transactions but also utility contribution of transactions in a 
database. Moreover, a two-phased mining algorithm is also 
proposed for effectively and efficiently finding the high 
transaction-weighted utility itemsets from a transactional 
database.  
The mining process of the proposed algorithm can be 
divided into two phases. In the first phase, the possible 
candidate transaction-weighted utility itemsets are found 
level by level. In the second phase, the candidate 
transaction-weighted utility itemsets are further checked for 
their actual utility values by an additional database scan. 
Finally, the itemsets with their actual weighted-utility values 
larger than or equal to a predefined threshold are output as 
the high transaction-weighted utility itemsets. The 
experimental results on synthetic datasets also show the 
good performance of the proposed approach. 
 
II. RELATED WORKS 
In this section, some related researches are briefly 
reviewed. They are utility mining and weighted association-
rule mining. 
A. Utility Mining 
In association-rule mining, only binary itemsets are 
considered. However, products bought in transactions may 
contain profits and quantities in real-world applications. 
Especially, some high-profit products may occur with low 
frequencies in a database. The high-profit but low-frequency 
itemsets may not be found in traditional association-rule 
mining approaches.  
Chan et al. thus proposed utility mining to discover high 
utility itemsets [4]. They considered not only the quantities 
of the items in a product combination but also their profits. 
Formally, local transaction utility and external utility are 
used to measure the utility of an item. The local transaction 
utility of an item is directly obtained from the information 
stored in a transaction dataset, like the quantity of the item 
sold in a transaction. The external utility of an item is given 
by users, like its profit. 
Liu et al. then proposed a two-phased algorithm to 
discover high utility itemsets from a database by adopting 
the downward-closure property [11]. They named their 
approach as the transaction-weighted-utilization (TWU) 
model. It used the whole utility of a transaction as the upper 
bound of an itemset in that transaction to keep the 
downward-closure property. It consisted of two phases. In 
phase 1, the model found out possible candidate itemsets 
from a database. In phase 2, the database was rescanned 
again to update the actual utility of the possible candidate 
itemsets and found the ones with their actual utility values 
larger than or equal to a predefined threshold (called the

minimum utility threshold). Several other algorithms for 
utility mining were also proposed [6][7][17][18][19], and 
some related studies are still in progress [5][15].  
B. Weighted Association-Rule Mining  
Weighted association-rule mining [3][10][12][13][16] is 
concerned with the analysis of significance of items or 
transactions in a set of data. It is proposed to find out 
different kinds of interesting patterns from a set of data with 
item weight or transaction weight. The weights in these 
approaches may be thought of as an extension of traditional 
support in association-rule mining. Weighted association 
rules can be discovered in a variety of forms, like weighted 
association rules, fuzzy weighted association rules, and 
weighted utility association rules. 
Lu et al. proposed a new mixed weighted mining model 
[12] for finding weighted association rules from a set of data. 
The weighted rules might provide more useful and 
interesting information to decision makers in many 
applications such as retail marketing, data stream, medical 
data analysis, and among others. 
Khan et al. then discovered weighted utility association 
rules from a database by considering both quantities of items 
sold in a single transaction and weight values of items given 
by experts [10]. In their model, the transaction weighted 
utility measure is used to find out all weighted utility 
association rules from a set of data. However, the model did 
not consider the actual utility of itemsets in a database. If we 
consider both the actual utility of itemsets and the weight 
values of transactions in a database, we may find out 
different interesting patterns. In this paper, both utility 
contribution of itemsets and transactions are thus considered, 
instead of only one perspective of transactions in the 
weighted utility association rule model. 
 
III. THE PROPOSED MINING ALGORITHM 
A. The proposed algorithm for finding high transaction-
weighted utility itemsets 
The proposed algorithm for finding high transaction-
weighted utility itemsets can be divided into two phases. 
Phase 1 first finds all the possible candidate transaction-
weighted utility itemsets from a database. Next, phase 2 
scans the database again to find the actual weighted utility 
values of the possible candidate transaction-weighted utility 
itemsets and judge whether they are high transaction-
weighted utility itemsets (HTWUI). The details of the 
proposed algorithm are listed below.  
The algorithm: 
INPUT:  (1) A set of m items I = {i1, i2, …, ij, …, im}, each ij 
with a profit value pj, j = 1 to m; 
(2) A transaction database D = {Trans1, Trans2, …, 
Transn}, in which each transaction includes a 
subset of items with quantities; 
(3) The minimum weighted-utility threshold ?. 
OUTPUT: The set of high transaction-weighted utility 
itemsets. 
Phase 1: 
STEP 1:  For each y-th transaction Transy in the set of 
transactions D, do the following substeps. 
(a) Calculate the utility value uyz of each z-th item 
iyz in Transy as: 
,q*su yzyzyz =  
where syz is the profit of item iyz and qyz is the 
quantity of iyz . 
(b) Calculate the transaction utility tuy of the 
transaction Transy as: 
 .utu
z
yzy ?=  
STEP 2:  Calculate the total transaction utility ttu in the set 
of transactions D as: 
 .tuttu
y
y?=  
STEP 3: For each y-th transaction Transy in the set of 
transactions D, do the following substeps. 
(a) Calculate the transaction-utility weight of 
Transy as: 
 .
ttu
tu
tuw yy =  
(b) Calculate the transaction-weighted utility of 
Transy as: 
.tuw*tutwu yyy =  
STEP 4: Calculate the transaction-weighted utility upper 
bound ubz of each item iz as the summation of the 
transaction-weighted utilities of the transactions 
which include iz. That is: 
.tu*tuwub y
Transi
yy
yz
?
?
=  
STEP 5: Check whether the transaction-weighted utility 
upper bound of an item iz is larger than or equal 
to ?. If iz satisfies the above condition, put it in 
the set of candidate transaction-weighted utility 
1-itemsets, C1. That is: 
.}1,|{1 mzubiC yz ???= ?  
STEP 6: Set r = 1, where r represents the number of items 
in the current set of candidate transaction-
weighted utility itemsets (Cr) to be processed. 
STEP 7: Generate the candidate set Cr+1 from Cr with all 
the r-sub-itemsets in each candidate in Cr+1 must 
be contained in Cr. 
STEP 8: Calculate the transaction-weighted utility upper 
bound ubs of each candidate transaction-
weighted utility (r+1)-itemset as the summation 
of the transaction-weighted utilities of the 
transactions which include s. That is: 
.* y
Transs
ys tutuwub
y
?
?
=  
STEP 9: Check whether the transaction-weighted utility 
upper bound of each candidate (r+1)-itemsets s 
315
is larger than or equal to ?. If s does not satisfy 
the above condition, remove it from Cr+1. That 
is: 
.},|{ 11 ++ ??= rsr CoriginalsubsCNew ?  
STEP 10: If Cr+1 is null, do the next step; otherwise, set r = 
r + 1 and repeat STEPs 7 to 10. 
 
Phase 2: 
STEP 11: For each candidate transaction-weighted utility 
itemset s, calculate its actual transaction-
weighted utility value twus as follows: 
,*)( y
Transs si
yzs tuwutwu
y z
? ?
? ?
=  
 where uyz is the utility value of each item iz in 
transaction Transy and tuwy is the transaction-
utility weight of transaction Transy in D. 
STEP 12: Check whether the actual transaction-weighted 
utility value twus of each candidate transaction-
weighted utility itemset s is larger than or equal 
to ?. If s satisfies the above condition, put it in 
the set of high transaction-weighted utility 
itemsets, HTWUI. That is: 
,},|{ CstwusHTWUI s ??= ?  
where C is the set of all the candidate 
transaction-weighted utility itemsets. 
STEP 13: Output the set of high transaction-weighted 
utility itemsets in HTWUI. 
 
IV. AN EXAMPLE 
In this section, an example is given to demonstrate the 
proposed mining algorithm based on the concept of 
transaction-weighted utility of itemsets. This is a simple 
example to show how the proposed algorithm can be easily 
used to find out the high transaction-weighted utility 
itemsets from a set of transactions. Assume the ten 
transactions shown in TABLE I are used for mining. Each 
transaction consists of two features, transaction 
identification (TID) and items purchased. There are four 
items in the database, respectively denoted A to D. The 
value attached to each item is the quantity sold in the 
transaction. 
TABLE I.   THE SET OF TEN TRANSACTIONS IN THIS EXAMPLE. 
TID A B C D 
Trans1 1 0 1 14 
Trans 2 0 0 6 0 
Trans 3 1 0 2 4 
Trans 4 0 1 4 0 
Trans 5 0 0 3 1 
Trans 6 0 0 1 13 
Trans 7 0 0 8 0 
Trans 8 4 0 0 7 
Trans 9 0 1 1 10 
Trans 10 0 1 0 18 
 
Also assume that the predefined profit value for each 
single item is defined in TABLE II. 
TABLE II.  THE PREDEFINED PROFIT VALUES OF THE ITEMS. 
Item Profit 
A 1 
B 10 
C 6 
D 3 
 
In this example, the transaction-weighted utility values 
of itemsets {C}, {D}, {BD} and {CD} are larger than or 
equal to ? according to the processing way of the proposed 
algorithm. They are thus put into the set of high transaction-
weighted utility itemsets, HTWUI, as shown in TABLE III. 
TABLE III.  HIGH TRANSACTION-WEIGHTED UTILITY ITEMSETS. 
High Transaction- 
Weighted Utility Itemset 
Transaction- 
Weighted Utility 
C 9.20  
D 14.79  
BD 9.20  
CD 10.97  
 
In this example, four high transaction-weighted utility 
itemsets are generated. Note that if the traditional utility 
mining way is used, the results will be {C}, {D} and {CD}. 
The proposed algorithm based on the transaction-weighted 
utility concept can discover more unknown utility itemsets 
from a set of high-utility transactions in a transactional 
database. For example, the itemset {BD} is a high utility 
itemset in the high-utility transactions such as transactions 1, 
6, 7, 9 and 10. But the itemset {BD} cannot be discovered 
by using traditional utility mining. 
Under the perspective of the transaction-weighted utility, 
utility contribution of itemsets in the high-utility 
transactions will be more noticeable with the increase of 
influence degree of transaction utility. The item 
combination in a high transaction-weighted utility itemset 
can thus really show different information against the 
traditional high utility itemsets. 
 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A series of experiments was conducted to compare the 
effects of the traditional and the proposed high utility 
patterns and to evaluate the performance of the proposed 
mining algorithm with different parameter values. The 
experiments were implemented in J2SDK 1.5.0 and 
executed on a PC with 3.0 GHz CPU and 1GB memory. 
The public IBM data generator was first used in our 
experiments [9]. However, since our objective was to 
discover high utility itemsets, we also developed a 
simulation model, which was similar to that used in [11], to 
generate the quantities of the items in the transactions. Each 
316
quantity ranged among 1 to 5 according to the way in [11]. 
Moreover, for each dataset generated, a corresponding 
utility table was also generated in which a profit value lying 
among 0.01 to 10.00 was randomly assigned to an item. 
Figure 1 shows the profit value distribution of all the items 
generated by the simulation model in the utility table. 
 
 
Figure 1.  The profit value distribution in the synthetic data set. 
In the experimental evaluation, the used parameters, T, I, 
N and D, represented the average length of items per 
transaction, the average length of maximal potentially 
frequent itemsets, the total number of different items, and 
the total number of transactions, respectively. 
Experiments were made on the synthetic dataset 
T10I4N4KD200K to evaluate the difference rate between 
traditional high utility itemsets and high transaction-
weighted utility itemsets. The experimental results for 
different minimum weighted-utility thresholds are shown in 
Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2.  The difference rate between two kinds of patterns under 
different minimum weighted-utility thresholds. 
It could be observed from the figure that the difference 
rate between the two kinds of patterns varied along with 
different minimum weighted-utility thresholds. The obvious 
difference rates between the two kinds of patterns were 
achieved. It could be explained as follows. In the traditional 
utility mining model, it only considers actual utility of 
itemsets but not significance of transaction utility. It may 
lose some unknown high utility itemsets in a set of high-
utility transactions. But those unknown high utility itemsets 
existing in a set of high-utility transactions may be easier to 
be found by our proposed algorithm. The difference rate 
between the traditional high utility itemsets and the 
described high transaction-weighted utility itemsets was 
thus very obvious under the same parameter settings. 
Experiments were at last made to evaluate the efficiency 
of the proposed mining algorithm (TP-HTWUI). Figure 3 
showed the execution time on the T10I4N4KD200K dataset 
for different thresholds varying from 0.10% to 0.02%. It 
could be easily observed that the execution time of the 
proposed mining algorithm increased along with the 
increase of the threshold value.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have proposed a new kind of patterns, 
called the high transaction-weighted utility itemsets, which 
consider the transaction utility significance of each of the 
transactions in a database. Moreover, we have also proposed 
the two-phased mining algorithm to effectively and 
efficiently discover the described patterns from a 
transactional database. The experimental results show that 
the proposed high transaction-weighted utility patterns have 
a good effect from high-utility transactions in a database 
when compared to the traditional utility patterns. In the 
future, we would apply the proposed knowledge type and 
approach to some practical applications, such as 
supermarket promotion applications.
