Abstract— In this study, we present a novel approach to 
recommend the personalized book lists for the university 
members. Our approach consists of clustering the university 
members into different clusters based on their recent circulation 
activities and discovering the interest patterns of members in the 
cluster. In the first step, we clustered members sharing the 
common interests to the same cluster by using K-means 
algorithm, after that we explored the possible interest patterns 
performed by members in each cluster by association rules. 
Finally, we provided the recommended booklists that satisfy 
their individual needs and interest patterns. A questionnaire 
survey was performed to evaluate the accuracy satisfaction of 
predicting the satisfy booklist to an individual. The evaluation 
results reveal the possibility of using circulation activity history 
to predict the current interest of an individual member and 
construct the personalized book lists that satisfy their interests. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Many online businesses are trying to improve their 
marketing approach by discovering the customer interest and 
delivering the personalized recommendation list of the 
products that satisfy the customer needs. The personalized 
recommendation lists capitalize in motivating the new 
customers and retaining the existing customers [1]. 
Similarly, to improve the personal efficiency in the 
academic organizer consisting of members with variety in 
interests, the organizer should provide the information 
satisfying their interests.  This work applies the personalized 
recommendation system to the library’s circulation activities 
for generating the personal book list for its members. The 
problem of personalized book recommendation system is the 
enormous number of members and books. Under this 
circumstance, we cannot create the specific booklist for an 
individual member. To solve this problem, we categorized the 
members into clusters based on the similarity of their interests 
and assigned the suitable book categories to the members 
within the cluster. A book categorization system that is widely 
used in libraries is the LC call number. This system classifies 
the books into different subject areas. For member clustering, 
we adopt the concept of data mining techniques such as K-
means clustering algorithm to cluster the members based on 
their transaction history. This technique is similar to the news 
feed service of Carvalho et al [2] which used an internet 
access log file to cluster the users with similar behavior and 
deliver the suitable news to the cluster members.   
We also extended the book recommendation system by 
studying the interest patterns of members in different clusters. 
The interest patterns are discovered by analyzing the patterns 
of circulation activities performed by the members through 
the association rules. To approach the current interest of an 
individual, we considered both explicit and implicit patterns 
by using Apriori and Tertius association algorithm to analyze 
the circulation data.  
In order to generate the recommendation list for the 
members, we adopt the concept of collaboration by 
aggregating the favorite from all members similar to the work 
of Romero et al. [3] which used the web usage pattern of one 
group of student to construct the web travelling 
recommendation system for other students in the self learning 
environment. 
In the end of our study, we evaluate the user satisfaction to 
their personal book recommendation list. The evaluation 
results reveal the possibility of using circulation activity 
history to predict the current interest of an individual member 
and construct the personalized book recommendation lists. 
II. PROPOSED BOOK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 
The processes of our proposed book recommendation 
system can be divided into 2 main stepspatron clustering and 
interest pattern discovery. In the first step, the library 
circulation history data is preprocessed to eliminate noise. 
After that the cleansed data is passed through the patron 
clustering process. In this state, we clustered patrons with 
similar interest into the same cluster and differentiates patrons 
with unrelated interest into other clusters. In the second step, 
the possible interest patterns performed by patrons in each 
cluster were discovered. We can generate the cluster 
preference lists and discover the cluster interest patterns via 
the association rules. Finally, the personalized book 
recommendation list was generated for an individual member 
of the cluster. The diagram representing the process of our 
proposed system is shown in Fig. 1. The detail of our 
proposed system is explained below.

A. Book Categorization based on LC call number[4] 
The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is a system 
of library classification developed by the Library of Congress. 
LC call number divides subjects into boards categories 
(classes) represented by an English capital letter are shown in 
Table I.

Each class contains subclasses representing more specific 
categories. The example of subclasses for class Q can be 
shown in Table II.

In this study, we categorized books at the level of LC call 
subclasses. The total number of subclasses is 219 subclasses.  
There are other types of proprietary systems of library 
classification such as Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) 
that can be used to categorize the book in the library. Our 
concept can be applied to any of those which hierarchically 
divide subjects into classes and subclasses. 
B. Data Collection 
The data of circulation activities are collected from the 
circulation history database of the Library Management (LM) 
system of King Mongkut’s University of Technology 
Thonburi. Circulation activities consist of check in, check out, 
reservation, renew, fine related activities, etc. However, we 
used only check out, reservation, and renew transactions since 
other activities do not represent the member interest on 
particular subject. The transactions were collected during 
20/12/2008-12/10/2009. There are 70,720 transactions 
performed by 4,421 patrons. The information for each 
transaction consists of patron ID, and the LC call number of 
item. 
After collecting the history of circulation activities, we 
constructed the feature vector of circulation activities for an 
individual member by counting the numbers of transactions 
related to both patron ID and LC call subclass (see Table III). 
For example, a member with patron ID 100001 has 5 
circulation activities on books of subclass QA. Initially, the 
390
feature vector has 219 elements corresponding to LC 
subclasses. 
TABLE III

1040433 0 0 0 … 0 … 0 … 0 
C. Data Preprocess 
The feature vectors of circulation activity give the 
information of the number of transactions that an individual 
member employed the items in each subclass. We filtered the 
trivial data by removing the feature vector of members that 
have the total number of transactions less than 5. Moreover, 
we also removed the subclasses that have the total number of 
transaction less than 5. Finally, we have the number of 
members and LC call subclass equal to 2031 members and 90 
subclasses, respectively. 
After filter the insignificant data, the next step is data 
normalization. We normalized the number of transactions that 
an individual member performed in each subclass by dividing 
it with the total number of transactions for an individual 
member. Hence, we got the circulation matrix which is 
feature vectors consist of the proportion of transactions that a 
member made in each subclass from their total transactions.  
D. Patron Clustering Based on Library Circulation 
Activities 
K-Means algorithm  
The K-means algorithm is the most prominent clustering 
technique measuring the distance between each data object 
and the centroid (or medoid) of each cluster. The data object 
is assigned to the cluster with the smallest distance.  
The basic K-means algorithm can be described by the 
following algorithm [5]. 
 
Algorithm: Basic K-means algorithm. 
 
1: Select K points as initial centroids. 
2: repeat 
3: Assigning each instance to its closest centroid. 
4: Recompute the centroid for each cluster. 
5: until Centroids do not change. 
 
 
Patron Clustering 
In order to group the members based on the similarity in 
circulation activities, we conceptualized and viewed each 
patron ID as a transaction deal and the LC call subclass as the 
items of this transaction. We clustered the members into 10 
clusters by using K-means algorithm of the software WEKA 
[6]. The results of clustering are the list of cluster assignments 
of each individual member. Moreover, the centroid for each 
cluster is calculated. After that the dominant subclasses in a 
certain cluster are selected. These subclasses can be detected 
as the outliers of the normal probability plot of centroid 
values in that cluster and can be represented by the histogram 
of Fig. 2. 
 
Fig.2 Histogram of the cluster centroid. The dominant subclass is the 
subclass having the significant high degree of transactions    
Finally, the dominant subclasses will be assigned to be the 
representative name for the cluster. For example, the cluster 
with high centroid of QA was named as Mathematics group.     
E. Association Rule Generation for Interest Patterns 
Discovery 
Association Analysis 
The example of association rule analysis was originally 
proposed in the common problem known as market basket 
transactions for discovering hidden purchase patterns in a 
large transaction data. 
Let I= {i1, i2,…,id} be the set of all items in a market basket 
data and T={t1, t2,…,tN} be the set of all transactions. Each 
transaction ti contains a subset of items in I. An association 
rule is an implication expression of the form XY, where X 
and Y are disjoint itemsets, and XI, and YI. The importance 
of an association rule is measured in terms of support and 
confidence. The support value of the rule XY is the fraction 
of transactions containing both X and Y, while its confidence 
value is the fraction of transactions containing Y to the 
transactions containing X [5]. The formal definitions of 
support and confidence can be represented by Eq.1. 
)(

                                (1) 
The value of support is an important feature to define the 
popular patterns. Whereas the confidence measure the 
reliability of the inference made by a rule. For example, the 
high confidence of the rule XY means that it is the high 
391
possibility that Y will be presented in the transactions 
containing X. 
Apriori [5] is an algorithm for mining association rules. 
This strategy control the exponential growth of candidate 
itemsets based on the support measure called support-based 
pruning. In order to eliminate the uninteresting itemsets, we 
need to setup the support threshold value. Initially, every item 
will be considered and the candidate item with lower support 
than the threshold will be discarded. Next, the algorithm will 
iteratively generate new candidates of k-itemsets by using 
only the frequent itemsets found in the previous step and 
calculate their support values. The itemsets with low support 
value will be eliminates. The algorithm terminates when there 
are no new frequent itemsets generated. Finally, the 
association rules are generated from the frequent itemsets. 
The rules are generated by partitioning frequent item Y into 
two setsX and Y-X and calculate the confidence of rule 
XY-X. The rules with low confidence may be discarded. Fig. 
3 shows the example of association rules generation from the 
frequent itemset Y={a,b,c,d}. We can see that, there are 14 
possible rules generated from this frequent itemset.

bcd -> a acd -> b abd -> c abc -> d
cd -> ab bd -> ac bc -> ad ad -> bc ac -> bd ab -> cd
d -> abc c -> abd b -> acd a -> bcd
 
Fig.3 Association rules generation from the frequent itemset 
Y={a,b,c,d} 
Tertius is another algorithm for extracting the implicit, 
unusual, or interesting rules. The idea of this algorithm is to 
measure how strongly the rule is confirmed by determining 
the number of instances that satisfy the rule together with the 
number of counter-instances of the rule [7]. For example, to 
consider the confirmation of the rule mother(X,Y) 
female(X), we will focus on the number of counter-
instances of this rule which is the number of instances satisfy 
the rule mother(X,Y) not(female(X)). Tertius algorithm can 
be run by setting the following values [8]: 
 Confirmation threshold: the minimal confirmation of 
the accepted rule AB. 
 Noise threshold and frequency threshold are the 
maximal and minimal frequencies of the counter-
instances of the role AB. 
Association Rules of the Circulation Activity 
After clustering patron based on their similarity of interest, 
to discover the relationships of interesting patterns of patrons 
in a cluster, we apply association rules for analyzing the 
transaction data. The steps of association rule generation start 
from quantizing the number of transactions in a circulation 
matrix into 3 levels of interest: low, medium, and high 
according to the distribution of our gathered data. In this work, 
we used the following criteria for assigning levels of interest. 
 The level of interest is low, if the proportion of 
transaction that a member made in each subclass is 
less than or equal to 0.1. 
 The level of interest is medium, if the proportion of 
transaction that a member made in each subclass is 
higher than 0.1 but less than or equal to 0.4. 
 The level of interest is high, if the proportion of 
transaction that a member made in each subclass is 
higher than 0.4. 
Hence, we got the circulation pattern composing of the 
nominal scale for representing the degree of interest in 
different book categories. The matrix of interesting degree of 
patrons in each cluster is the input data for generating cluster 
association rules. By matching the appropriate association 
rule to the past transactions of each patron in a cluster, we can 
predict their future requirements. 
F. Discovery of Cluster Member’s Preferences 
In this study, we generated the book recommendation list 
by analyzing the past transactions performed by all members 
in each group and find the characteristic of book that favored 
by the majority of members. 
Our collaborative member preference task generates the 
similar interested information among members in a specific 
cluster. The similar interested information used in this study 
includes the favorite title and the favorite authors. These 
favorite lists are built from the collection of past transactions 
performed by members within a cluster.  
Finally, the book recommendation list for each patron is 
created by selecting the book items having the characteristics 
that match the favorite lists for example the book from the 
favorite author. Our book recommendation list contains 10 
book titles selected from the favorite title list, the newest 
books from the favorite authors, and also includes the new 
arrival books. The proportion of books for different categories 
depends on the related association rule of an individual patron. 
For example, the patron with related association rule as 
QD=high QA=high will get the recommended book list 
containing 5 books from QD category and another 5 books 
from QA category, where the patron with related association 
rule as QD=high QC=low will get the recommended book 
list with all of 10 books from QD category. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. Patron Clustering by K-means Algorithm 
By applying K-means algorithm, we clustered the patrons 
based on the similarity in their library circulation activities 
392
into 10 clusters. The number of members and the dominant 
subclasses for each cluster are shown in Table IV.

The result shows that there are at most two dominant 
subclasses for each cluster. This result suggests that the 
members within the same cluster share the common interests 
in specific domains and differ from the members in other 
clusters. 
B. Example of Generated Association Rules  
We generated the association rules for each cluster by using 
the transaction data of patrons in the cluster. The association 
rules are generated by Apriori algorithm of WEKA software. 
Because we prefer the variety of rules to support the variety 
of patron requirements, we setup the low value of support 
threshold to 0.2 and confidence threshold equals to 0.8. 
Moreover, we run the Tertius algorithm to extract the implicit 
association rules by setup the confirmation threshold equals to 
0.1, frequency threshold equals to 0, noise threshold equals to 
0.01. The intra-cluster association rules for different clusters 
can be shown in Table V.

Each intra-cluster association rules will be interpreted to 
the proportion of books from different categories. The number 
of books from different categories will be the average number 
of books derived from all matched rules. Table VI represents

C. Evaluation of the Proposed Personalized 
Recommendation  
 To evaluate the accuracy of using the data of library 
circulation activities to predict the patron’s interested booklist, 
we sent the questionnaire consisting of the personalized book 
recommended list to a group of patrons of the library. In the 
questionnaire, we asked the patrons to specify the books from 
the list of 10 books that highly correlated with his/her 
interests. 
There are fourteen out of fifty four patrons answered the 
question. The respondents are divided into 2 groups: 
instructor-researcher, and student (5 and 9 patrons, 
respectively) from 5 faculties. The total average number of 
selected books is 4.21 out of ten. The average number of 
selected books for instructor-researcher group and student 
group are 3.80 and 4.44, respectively. The average number of 
selected books separated by book properties into favorite title, 
favorite author, and new release can be shown in Fig. 4.

 Fig.4 The average number of selected books separated by book 
properties into favorite title, favorite author, and new release 
IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
The total average number of books selected by the 
respondents is 4.21 out of ten recommended books (42.10%). 
This value closes to 38.10% accuracy rate of assigning book 
recommendation list generated from the expertise information 
of each respondent in the online bookstore application of [9]. 
By considering the large number of books in the library, this 
number is sufficiently high to specify the scope of books that 
satisfy the individual.  
The analysis of interesting pattern by association rules can 
be used to clarify the future requirement of the patron in each 
cluster.   In Table VI, two patrons in cluster 1 which share the 
common interest of chemistry have different circulation 
patterns. This leads to different in characteristic of book 
recommendation list assigned to these patrons.   
The reply of respondents from the computer engineering 
departments suggests that the patron profile should be used in 
the book recommendation list generation phase to improve the 
quality of the book recommendation system. As we saw that 
the instructors and students in this group were more interested 
in the books with LC call number between QA76.75-
QA76.765 which related to the computer software than the 
other subclasses (the average number of selected books with 
LC call number between QA76.75-QA76.765 is 86.16% of 
their total selected books).  
The results of patron evaluation also suggest that students 
are more interested in the favorite title books than the author 
favorite, and new release books. These favorite book titles are 
the books used in their study. Hence, this result can indicate 
the student demands for the book acquisition process.   
The present study is only the preliminary experiment that 
reveals the possibility of using circulation activity history to 
predict the future interest of an individual member and then 
provides the book recommended lists obtained from the 
transactions of other members which share the common 
interest. However, we need to perform the evaluation test with 
larger number of sample patrons. 
This study has the contribution in the personalization 
systems such as the university web portal. Under this 
circumstance, we not only provide the ways to access the 
relevant information, but also satisfy the individual 
requirement.
