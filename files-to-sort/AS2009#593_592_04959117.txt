Abstract—Extracting the association rules is an important 
research topic among the various data mining problems. Based 
on the rough set theory which is a powerful tool in dealing with 
incompleteness and uncertainty, an algorithm to mine 
association rules in incomplete information systems is 
presented. In the new algorithm, the support and confidence 
are redefined and a new judgment criterion is introduced in. 
The algorithm can mine the positive, invalid and negative 
association rules directly without processing missing values. 
The experiment shows that the new algorithm has short 
execution times, and can mine effective association rules 
efficiently.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Association rules mining as an important technique of 
data mining was firstly developed by Agrawal et al[1]. Now 
association rules extracted are often positive association 
rules based on the support-confidence criteria. Let X, Y be a 
set of items, “X causes Y to happen” is often called a 
positive rule. “X causes Y not to happen” is called a negative 
rule. Negative association rules play an important role in 
decision making in the fields of investment analysis and 
competitive analysis. Brin et al[2] pointed out the importance 
of negative rules. Savasere et al[3] expressed the problems of 
negative rules . Luo Ke et al[4] added effect as a criterion, 
and mined both positive and negative association rules. 
Incomplete information systems(IIS) are the widest 
forms of data existence. Incompleteness of objects is the 
biggest obstacle studying from data. There are two types of 
approaches for IIS. One is to transform the incomplete 
systems to complete ones. For example, removing 
methods[5], filling the missing values[6-7], and et al. But 
these methods above may make the data distorted to some 
degree, and noisy maybe introduced into datasets so that the 
rules extracted are unusable. Another is to obtain the rules 
from IIS directly without processing missing values. The 
common method is based on rough sets[8]. 
An algorithm to mine association rules in incomplete 
information systems is presented. The support and 
confidence are redefined and a new judgment criterion is 
introduced in based on the rough set theory. The algorithm 
can mine both positive and negative association rules directly 
without processing missing values. 
II. BASIC CONCEPTS 
A. Association rules 
The aim of mining association rules is to find out the 
hidden, interesting relationships among the items in large 
datasets. The basic concepts of association rules are given as 
follows[9]. 
Let 1 2 m{ , , ..., I }I I I=  be a set of items and 
1 2{ , , ..., }nD t t t=  be a set of transactions, where ti is a set of 
items such that it I? . An association rule is an implication 
of the form X Y? , where ,X Y I?  and X Y? = ? . The 
rule X Y?  holds in the set D with support and confidence, 
where support is the percentage of transactions in D that 
contain both X and Y, and confidence is the percentage of 
transactions in D containing X that also contain Y. 
An association rule must satisfy a user-set minimum 
support(minsup) and minimum confidence(minconf). The 
rule X Y?  is called a strong association rule if support ?
minsup and confidence?minconf. 
B. Classification of association rules 
The conventional framework for mining association rules 
is the support-confidence. But using this conventional 
framework it may produce a lot of redundant, useless and 
even misleading rules. So people introduce into new criteria 
to strengthen the judgments of strong association rules. In [4], 
it added the effect in the judgment criterion, and gave two 
thresholds of effect E1 and E2(E1<0<E2, approaching zero). 
It classified strong association rules into positive, invalid and 
negative association rules. The classification of association 
rules is shown in table I.

negative rules ?minsup ?minconf effect?E1 
III. MINING ASSOCIATION RULES IN IIS 
A. Incomplete information systems(IIS) 
The definition of incomplete information systems(IIS) is 
given as follows[10].

Definition 1 Information system IS is a tuple 
( , , , )IS U A V f= ,where: 
U  is a nonempty finite set of objects called the universe 
of discourse; 
A  is a nonempty finite set of attributes; 
Va  is a set of values for the attribute a, a A aV V?= ? ; 
:f U A V× ?  is a information function, it give a value 
to every attributes, i.e., a A? ? , x U? , ( , ) af x a V? . 
If a A? ? , x U? , ( , ) *f x a = , the information systems 
is called incomplete information systems(IIS), otherwise it is 
complete. 
B. Rough sets approaches 
It is hoped to handle data with no changes of the original 
information for mining association rules in IIS. Rough set 
theory[11] is a new mathematical approach to deal with 
imprecision, uncertainty and incompleteness. In this paper, 
equivalence relation, upper and lower approximation, and 
boundary are redefined for mining association rules. 
Definition 2 Let ( , , , )IS U A V f=  be a complete 
information systems, <attribute, value> is called a relation 
item, that is < ,a v > where a A? , av V? . 
Definition 3 Let ( , , , )IS U A V f=  be a complete 
information system, equivalence relation RX  based on item 
X is expressed as: 
{ }| , : ( , )RX x U a v X f x a v= ? ? < >? =          (1) 
RX indicates the set of objects which are match to X in 
U. 
Because there are missing values(*) in IIS, equivalence 
relation doesn’t exist in datasets. But we can define the max 
set and the min set of objects matching to items. These 
definitions are similar to upper and lower approximation in 
classical rough set. 
Definition 4 Let ( , , , )IIS U A V f=  be an incomplete 
information system, for x U? , we denote RX  the max set 
of the objects that are equivalent to X, i.e., 
{ }| , : ( , )RX x U a v X f x a v= ? ? < >? =          (2) 
and denote RX  the max set of the objects that are similar to 
X, i.e., 
{ }| , : ( , ) ( , ) *RX x U a v X f x a v f x a= ? ? < >? = ? =  (3) 
the boundary of X is defined: 
                                             
( )Rbn X RX RX= ?                                                        (4) 
It can be seen from Definition 4 that U RX?  indicates 
the set of objects which are surely unable to match X; and 
U RX?  indicates the set of objects which may possibly not 
match X. 
C. Redefinition of support and confidence 
The support and confidence can not be calculated exactly 
in incomplete information systems as complete ones, so 
some concepts of association rules are redefined in this 
paper. 
1) Estimates of support and confidence: Based on the 
definition 4, the minimal and maximal possible values of 
support and confidence are defined as follows. 
Definition 5 Minimal possible support(Supmin) of items 
of X is: 
                    ( )min
RX
Sup X
U
=                                       (5) 
Maximal possible support(Supmax) of items of X is: 
                   ( )max
RX
Sup X
U
=                                        (6) 
Definition 6 Minimal possible confidence(Confmin) of 
the association rule X Y?  is: 
( )
( )min
RX RY
Conf X Y
RX RY RX U RY
?? =
? + ? ?
        (7) 
Maximal possible confidence(Confmax) of the association 
rule X Y?  is: 
  ( )
( )max
RX RY
Conf X Y
RX RY RX U RY
?? =
? + ? ?
     (8) 
2) Expectations of support and confidence: Above 
formulas give the estimates of support and confidence of 
rules in IIS. When the difference between the minimal and 
the maximal possible support is big, it is still very difficult 
to process the data. It is very favorable if the values of 
support and confidence are closer to the actual ones. 
In the rough set theory, the uncertainty of rough set is 
caused by the uncertainty of rough boundary[11]. The 
bigger the rough boundary of X is, the smaller the certainty 
of rough set is. When the difference between the minimal 
and the maximal possible support is big, it shows that the 
boundary of rough set X is big. It can reduce the difference 
based on rough boundary so as to get the expectation value 
of support which is close to the actual one. 
Definition 7 Expectation support(Supexp) of items of X 
is: 
634
              
min
exp
R
Sup (X)
Sup (X)
1 - bn (X) U
=                              (9) 
According to the definitions of Supmin, Supmax and 
boundary of X, property 1 is expressed as follows: 
Property 1 Let X be a set of items, 
( ) ( ) ( )R max minbn X U Sup X Sup X= ? . 
Proof. From (4), it can be derived ( )Rbn X U = 
RX RX U? = RX U RX U? , from (5), (6), it can 
be derived  RX U RX U? = ( ) ( )max minSup X Sup X? , 
so ( )Rbn X U ? ( ) ( )max minSup X Sup X? . 
Then Definition 7 is redefined as:  
    ( )
( )
( )
1 ( ) ( )
min
exp
max min
Sup X
Sup X
Sup X Sup X
=
? ?
                (10) 
Definition 8 Expectation confidence(Confexp) of the 
association rule X Y?  is: 
            
( )
( )
( )
pre
exp
pre
Sup X Y
Conf X Y
Sup X
?? =                      (11) 
It can be seen from (10) that when the difference 
between the minimal and the maximal possible support is 
big, the rough boundary is big too, i.e., the denominator in 
the formula becomes small. Judging from this, the 
difference is reduced by enlarging ( )minSup X  which is the 
most conservative value of support, so that the support value 
is much closer to the actual one. 
After expectation support and expectation confidence 
are introduced in, the effect in [4] is redefined so as to mine 
both positive and negative association rules in IIS. 
Definition 9 Expectation effect(Effexp) of the association 
rule X Y?  is: 
If minsup ? ( )expSup Y <1 and ( )expConf X Y? -
( )expSup Y ? 0, then 
   
( ) ( )
( )
1 ( )
exp exp
exp
exp
Conf X Y Sup Y
Eff X Y
Sup Y
? ?? =
?
        (12) 
If minsup ? ( )expSup Y <1 and ( )expConf X Y? -
( )expSup Y <0, then 
       
( ) ( )
( )
( )
exp exp

exp
Conf X Y Sup Y
Eff X Y
Sup Y
? ?? =        (13) 
IV. DESCRIPTION OF MINING ALGORITHM 
A new algorithm for mining positive and negative 
association rules in incomplete information 
systems(MPNAR_IIS) is put forward based on classical 
Apriori[1]. The expectation support, expectation confidence 
and expectation effect are introduced into the mining 
algorithm in this paper. The process of the algorithm is 
expressed as follows. 
Step1: inputting the thresholds of support, confidence 
and effect, that is minsup, minconf, E1, E2; 
Step2: generating the frequent items based on Apriori, 
while the support of each rule is expectation support; 
Step3: computing the effect of association rules from 
frequent items, and giving away the invalid rules. For the 
rules whose effect values are minus values, considering their 
negative rules and recalculating their support and effect; 
Step4: computing the expectation confidence of the 
association rules by Step3, reserving the rules which meet 
Confexp( X Y? ) ? minconf. 
The strong association rules are generated following the 
above steps. 
V. EXPERIMENTS 
The experiment uses Mushroom dataset obtained from 
UCI machine learning repository. This dataset contains 8124 
samples and 2480 missing values. In this paper, we only 
mined mushroom edible or poisonous. To testify the 
effectiveness and performance of MPNAR_IIS, 
MPNAR_IIS was compared with the classical association 
rules mining algorithm based on Apriori. And before 
Apriori, missing values were completed based on fuzzy-
clustering in [6]. The setting of parameters: minsup=0.15, 
minconf=0.6, E1=-0.1, E2=0.2. The software using in the 
experiment was VC++. The experiment results are shown in 
table ?. 
TABLE II.  CLASSIFICATION  OF  ASSOCIATION  RULES 
MPNAR_IIS Algorithm based 
on Apriori
Number of rules 1353 1367 
Testing accuracy 98.71% 92.34%
Execution times(s) 304 375 
The strong association rules mined by MPNAR_IIS are 
composed of 631 positive rules, 283 invalid rules and 439 
negative rules. It indicates that positive rules are sometime a 
part of the strong association rules, and another part maybe 
invalid. 
It can be seen from table ?  that MPNAR_IIS has 
obvious advantages in testing accuracy and execution times 
compared with the algorithm based on Apriori. It indicates 
that completing missing values may obtain the rules 
unusable and also has higher time complexity. In brief, the 
experiment results prove that the new algorithm has high 
speed and efficiency without processing missing values, and 
can mine both positive and negative association rules.

VI. CONCLUSION 
The new algorithm of mining association rules in 
incomplete information systems based on rough set has the 
following advantages. 
(1)It does not change the structure of incomplete 
information systems and keep the original information not 
false; 
(2)Equivalence relation, upper and lower approximation, 
and boundary are defined based on relation items; 
(3)Some concepts of association rules such as support 
and confidence are redefined in incomplete systems. 
Expectation support, confidence and effect as the judgment 
criteria of rules are proposed. We can effectively discover 
both positive and negative association rules directly without 
processing missing values in IIS based on the expectation 
values.
