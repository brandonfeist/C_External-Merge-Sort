Abstract—The result of tennis match were great influenced by 
the level of technique and tactics decision-making, and how to 
find the characteristics of athletes' technique and tactics from 
mass data is a urgent problem which is needed to be shoveled, 
in order to make up the insufficiency of traditional statistical 
method and provide scientific basis for tennis technique and 
tactics decision-making. Based on association data mining 
theory and the Weka data mining platform, association data 
mining model was established, which was about the association 
between the stroke placement, stroke technique, stroke line 
and score of tennis technique and tactics. Specific case research 
were carried out from the following three perspectives, i.e. the 
association analysis between the last two stroke placement, line 
and win or lose of each point, the association analysis between 
the first three stroke placement and win or lose point in serve 
game, the association analysis between the first two stroke 
placement and win or lose point in service game. The research 
results indicate that the data mining model were capable of 
providing objective and scientific decision support for 
technique and tactics decision-making in tennis game and daily 
tennis technique and tactics training.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Data mining rose in 1990s, which is extract or mine the 
knowledge from the large amounts of data [1], and it is the 
combination of many subjects and technology. Data mining 
is mainly based on the method of discovery to find new 
knowledge and laws in large amounts of data, so it is also 
known as knowledge discovery in database ( KDD) 
The development of information technology enables 
people to descript sports events scientifically and 
quantitatively, which makes it possible to quantify decision-
making for people. But it is difficult to discover these 
hidden rules in large mounts of data by using single 
statistical method, which is not benefit to make scientific 
decision-making. Some more valuable information or rules 
will be discovered by using data mining that will make up 
the shortcomings of traditional statistical method, and this 
will be capable of providing decision support for people 
making tennis technique and tactics decision-making. 
Therefore, it is necessary for people to research and use data 
mining technology to assist them in tennis technique and 
tactics decision-making. 
Association analysis can help people to find interesting, 
potentially relation between things from a large amount of 
database, which can be presented in maximum frequent 
itemsets and association rules. The algorithm include Apriori 
algorithm[2] and its improved Apriori ? algorithm, FP- 
Growth and its improved algorithm[3] etc. 
II. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ASSOCIATION DATA MINING 
MODEL 
A. Fundamental conception 
Let I={i1,i2,i3…in} be a set of literals, called items. Let 
T={t1,t2,t3…tn} be a set of transactions, where each 
transaction T is a set of items such that T? I. In general?to 
contain 0 or more items in correlation analysis is called 
itemset. The transactions contain the number of itemset is 
called support count, and ?(A) means the support count of 
itemset A. Association rule is an implication of the form 
A==>B, where A? I, B? I, and A?B= Ø.A rule has a 
measure of its strength called support and confidence, which 
can be defined as follows: 
S (A?B) =
N
BA )( ??
          (1) 
C (A?B) = 
)(
)(
A
BA
?
? ?
         (2) 
In formula (1), N is the total number of transactions. 
Minsup is defined as minimum support, and minconf as 
minimum confidence. If the support of itemset is above 
minimum support, then the itemset is called large itemset. 
Given a set of transactions, the problem of mining 
association rules is to generate all association rules that have 
support and confidence greater than the user-specified 
minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence 
(minconf). The problem of discovering all association rules 
of sufficient support and confidence can be decomposed 
into two subproblems[4]. First, find all large itemsets, which 
are sets of items that have transaction support greater than 
minsup; Then, use the large itemsets to generate the desired 
rules which have a computed confidence greater than 
minconf. Fig. 1 shows an example of algorithm in 
production of large itemsets.

B. Algorithm 
Apriori algorithm is a basic algorithm that be used to 
discover large itemsets, and it used iterative structure 
method by pass over the database to generate large K+1-
itemsets by extensions of the large K-itemsets generated in 
the previous iteration. 
Algorithm Apriori Codes are as follows:

C. The realization of association rule data mining model 
According to the concept and algorithm theory of 
association analysis, the association can be analyzed 
between an indicator and stroke result in tennis game. In 
consideration of the requirement characteristic in tennis 
technique and tactics decision-making and on the base of 
previous research [5] of team, the relationship of stroke 
placement and win or lose point is researched in this paper. 
The data mining main steps (Fig. 2) were realized on the 
platform of Weka. 
1) Data collection 
Tennis technique and tactics information were collected 
by using tennis technique and tactics data collection 
software system, main indicators including stroke 
placement, stroke technique, forehand-stroke and backhand-
stroke etc.

According to expert requirement in decision-making, 
tennis court was divided into 6 areas in tennis technique and 
tactics information collection system. Tennis court area 
code was shown in table . Serve placement are coded 
independently (table). Table , table ?, table ?, table ? 
show stroke line code, stroke technique code, stroke Hand 
orientation code and stroke result code respectively.

2) Data extraction 
According to the requirement of decision-making, 
database interface was used to select meet requirement data 
fields and records. 
3) Data processing 
Anomaly data in database was checked and processed, 
such as deleting or modifying default data etc; data format 
was converted that extraction from the database, in order to 
make it meet the requirement of data mining tool in data 
format and data type. 
4) Data mining analysis 
According to  the collected technique and tactics 
database and combining requirement of tennis technique and 
tactics decision-making, processed data was imported to 
data mining tool, and technique and tactics rules was mined 
and reasonably interpreted to provide decision support for 
tennis technique and tactics decision-making. 
5) To be solved the problem by association rules data 
mining model 
The character of tennis technique and tactics can be 
reflected by such attributes as stroke placement, stroke 
technique, stroke line, and so on. Considering the character 
of association algorithm, i.e. combination is adopted to 
generate large itemsets once for one transaction, and based 
on this, association rules were generated.  Therefore, the 
association data mining model can be applied to mine one 
technique and tactics attribute character once. Moreover, the 
stroke sequence must be considered in data mining that is 
demanded in tennis technique and tactics decision-making. 
Only in this way, the rules that are mined have directive 
significance for actual decision-making of tennis technique 
and tactics. Theoretically, this data mining model can 
realize data mining analysis in any number of sequence 
stroke information. But in consider of the demand of the 
rules' confidence and support, the actual data mining 
analysis results indicate that the number of sequence stroke 
should be between 1 and 3 strokes. The research has 
obtained better decision making effect on these aspects as 
follows: the association analysis between stroke placement 
and stroke results (win or lose) in the first 1 to 3 sequence 
strokes in serve or receive of research object, the association 
analysis between stroke placement, stroke line and stroke 
results (win or lose) in the last two stroke of a rally. 
 
III. CASE ANALYSIS  
The technique and tactics information of Thirteen 
international open championships of Chinese elite female 
athlete Li Na was collected, and association data mining 
model that was established was used to mine the association 
rules between stroke placement, stroke line and stroke result 
(win or lose). The basic parameters setting of data mining 
model are as follows: minsup (10%), minconf (70%). 
A. The last two stroke placement and line association 
analysis  
As are shown in table ? and table ?, the association 
rules indicate that both Li Na and her opponents stroke the 
placement on middle area of court, the confidence of the 
stroke results are losing is more than 90%. The main stroke 
placement of Li Na wins the point on the last stroke are 
back court right and left area, which confidence is more than 
86%, and with relatively high support are 27.3% and 24.2% 
respectively. These rules indicate that on more than 2 
strokes per point content Li Na should decrease stroke to the 
opponents' middle court area, and increase stroke to the left 
or right side of the court, so as to enhance the rate of win 
point.  
Table ?  shows the results of the last two stroke 
association analysis between stroke line and stroke result. 
The rule indicates that the confidence and support that Li Na 
loses the point are 79% and 18.7% when Li Na stroke line is 
down the line shot. It suggests that Li Na should strengthen 
the ability of stroke down the line shot successfully. The 
opponents stroke two kinds of line in the next to the last 
stroke, i.e. crosscourt shot and Middle area to middle area, 
and then Li Na stroke back, the results show that Li Na lose 
the points with high rate. The confidences of these two rules 
are 74% and 72% respectively. The rules reveal that the 
capability of Li Na return crosscourt shot and middle area to 
middle area shot should be improve further.

Na stroke) ==> win 
88% 27.3% 
The next to the last stroke 
placement= back court left area (Li 
Na stroke) ==> win 
86% 24.2%

B. The first three association analysis (Li Na serve) 
The main results of association rule data mining are 
shown in table ? (Li Na serve). The result of Li Na stroke 
to opponent's back court middle area in the third stroke is 
lose, which confidence is 100%, and its support is 20.7%. 
This rule means, when Li Na serve, she should decreases the 
number of stroke to the middle area after the opponent 
receive in order to minimize lose rate. The second rule 
indicates that Li Na serve to the opponent's Right area 
internal angle, and then the opponent stroke to back court 
middle area, the stroke result is opponent win the point with 
confidence of 93% and support of 14.9%. This rule indicates 
that Li Na should strengthen defending of middle area 
placement   
 
TABLE X.  THE FIRST THREE STROKE  ASSOCIATION RULES  (LI NA 
SERVE)   
rules confidence support 
The third stroke placement= back 
court middle area ==>lose 100% 20.7% 
The First stroke placement= Right 
area internal angle, the second 
stroke placement =back court

93% 14.9% 
C. The first two stroke association analysis(Li Na receive) 
Li Na receive to the back court with high lose rate, and 
its confidence is 100%, and also with high support of 32.3% 
(table ?). The opponents win point when they serve to the 
right area external and left area internal, which the 
confidence is reach to more than 95%. These rules indicate 
that Li Na should decrease stroke to middle area when she 
receive, and strengthen the defense of right area external 
angle and left area internal angle in order to reduce lose rate. 
 
TABLE XI.  THE FIRST TWO STROKE  ASSOCIATION RULES (LI  NA 
RECEIVE)   
rules confidence support 
The second stroke 
placement=back court middle 
area ==>lose 
100% 32.3% 
The first stroke placement=right 
area external angle, the second 
placement=back court middle 
area==> lose 
100% 11.6% 
The first stroke placement= left 
area internal angle ==>win   95% 21.7% 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Using association analysis data mining technology, and 
combining tennis technique and tactics decision-making 
requirement, data mining analysis was realized on the 
relationship between tennis stroke placement, stroke line and 
stroke result. The case analysis indicates that adopting this 
method inherence relation between tennis stroke placement, 
line and result can be capable of discovering, and this will be 
benefit to provide science decision support for tennis game 
and daily technique and tactics training of athlete.
