I. INTRODUCTION 
The clustering techniques are used to group up the 
transactional data based on the similarity values. The pattern 
extraction methods are used to find out similar patterns in the 
transactional data sets. The system integrates the pattern 
extraction scheme with clustering method to improve the 
clustering process. The simultaneous clustering scheme uses 
the pattern and the transactional data for the clustering 
process. The partitioned clustering technique is enhanced in 
the system. The association rule mining technique and 
clustering technique are integrated in the simultaneous 
clustering process. The system is designed with the following 
objectives. 
¾  To maintain the patient diagnosis reports for the 
breast cancer patients 
¾ To correct the noisy records using the data 
preprocessing techniques 
¾ To apply the query based techniques to remove 
the redundant records 
¾ To use the aggregation based method to correct 
incomplete records 
¾ To use apriori algorithm to extract association 
rules To extract patterns from the frequent item 
set values 
¾ To perform data clustering using the 
transactional data sets 
¾ To prepare pattern clusters using the patterns 
¾ To carry out simultaneous clustering using the 
patterns and transactional data 
¾ To find the fitness values for cluster accuracy 
measurement process 
¾ To conduct a study to find out the performance 
of the clustering algorithms 
The simultaneous pattern extraction and clustering system 
is designed to perform the pattern extraction and clustering 
process in an integrated manner. The system reduces the 
process time for clustering process. Generally the data 
clustering and pattern extraction operations carried out 
separately. This system integrates the pattern extraction and 
clustering tasks to reduce the process time and improve the 
clustering accuracy. The breast cancer data sets are used in the 
system. The symptoms and their severity levels are maintained 
in the database. The symptom and their indication values are 
maintained as quantitative values.  
The system uses the association rule mining techniques 
and clustering techniques for the mining process. The pattern 
extraction is done using the association rule mining 
techniques. The frequent items are extracted using the priory 
algorithm. The patterns are extracted from the frequent items. 
The clustering algorithm is used to group up the transaction 
data based on similarity value. The system performs three type 
of clustering tasks. They are data clustering, pattern clustering 
and simultaneous clustering operations[8]. The data clustering 
tasks group the transaction data in the actual data set. The 
pattern clustering tasks is applied on the extracted patterns. 
The K-means clustering algorithm is used for the data 
clustering and pattern clustering process. 
The simultaneous clustering mechanism uses the patterns 
and actual transactional data. The K-means clustering 
algorithm is modified to perform the simultaneous clustering 
process. The K-means clustering algorithm uses the same data

values for the similarity computation and cluster assignment 
process. The modified K-means clustering algorithm uses the 
pattern information for the distance measure process and uses 
the associated transactional data for cluster assignment 
process. In this case minimum patterns are used for the 
comparison process but a set of transactional data are assigned 
into the corresponding cluster. The system also performs a 
preprocessing task to clean the data set from noisy records. 
The simultaneous clustering process uses more memory than 
data clustering technique. The process time is very low. The 
clustering accuracy is very high. 
The simultaneous pattern extraction and clustering 
technique is developed to improve the performance of the 
clustering system. The system uses the breast cancer patient 
diagnosis report for the clustering process. The pattern 
extraction and clustering process are integrated in the system.   
II.  MOTIVATION 
The major contributions of this work are summarized as 
follows: 
1. A simultaneous pattern and data clustering method is 
proposed. It is able to cluster not only patterns but 
also their associated data while making the relation 
between patterns and data explicit.  
2. Since the effectiveness of a pattern-clustering 
algorithm is highly dependent on the distance 
measures between patterns and their associated data, 
in this work, several distance measures are proposed, 
and their relations to existing common measures are 
studied. The key component of the proposed 
approach is the simultaneous pattern and data 
clustering. If it is able to cluster patterns and the 
associated data effectively in the divide phase, the 
subsequent analysis of individual clusters in the 
conquer phase will become simpler and more 
effective and can be conducted using existing well-
studied techniques. 
III. RELATED WORK 
Data mining, the extraction of hidden predictive 
information from large databases, is a powerful new 
technology with great potential to help companies focus on the 
most important information in their data warehouses1. Data 
mining tools predict future trends and behaviors, allowing 
businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions.  
Data warehousing represents an ideal vision of maintaining a 
central repository of all organizational data. Centralization of 
data is needed to maximize user access and analysis [2],[10]. 
Information is the backbone of any organization. An 
effective information system should be able to provide 
information to those in need of it at any time that they need 3. 
Data is an externally valuable corporate resource affecting 
productivity, profitability and strategic decisions, and any 
community of each importance requires planning from top 
management.  Data mining has attracted a great deal of 
attention due to the wide availability of huge amounts of data 
and the imminent need for turning such data into useful 
information [4]. 
Association rule mining for multiple database management 
Systems have continually evolved from primitive file systems 
to sophisticated and powerful relational and object oriented 
models5. Present day systems implement various constructs in 
the form of query optimizing modules, event-condition action 
rules to trigger events of interest and other mechanisms that 
have made their use imperative in most applications. 
Clustering is the process of grouping the data into clusters 
with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster 
similarity. There are several clustering techniques: partitioning 
methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods, grid-
based methods, and model based methods. The basic 
difference between classification and clustering is that 
classification is a supervised learning method, which assumes 
predefined class labels, while clustering is an   unsupervised 
learning method that does not assume any knowledge of 
classes. 
The effectiveness of clustering mainly depends on the 
distance measure, several distance measures between patterns 
and their associated data are proposed. Once pattern clusters 
and their associated data clusters are obtained, each of them 
can be further analyzed individually[6]. This paper presents a 
knowledge exploratory method using multiple pattern 
associations to conjecture structural and functional 
characteristics of bimolecular[7].  To uncover qualitative and 
quantitative patterns in a data set is a challenging task for 
research in the area of machine learning and data analysis. 
Due to the complexity of real-world data, high-order patterns 
or event associations, in addition to first-order class-dependent 
relationships, have to be acquired[8].   An attribute clustering 
method which is able to group genes based on their 
interdependence so as to mine meaningful patterns from the 
gene expression data. a small pool of selected genes can be 
used to build classifiers with very high classification rate. 
From the pool, gene expressions of different categories can be 
identified [9].  
IV. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
A. Pattern Discovery Concepts 
     Today, a primary challenge in data mining and knowledge 
discovery is to discover interesting relationships from data 
sets.  
       The basic idea of PD can be illustrated by a simple XOR 
problem with three binary variables: A, B and C for C = A * 
B. Suppose that the user want to check whether or not the 
occurrence of a compound event |A = T,B = T;C = F) is just a 
random happening. Given the observed frequency of 
occurrences o of the compound event, if the system could 
estimate its expected frequency of occurrences e under the 
random assumption, the system knows whether it is random or 
not by checking the difference (o – e). Such a notion is 
formulated as a hypothesis test. A compound event is called 
an event association pattern or simply a pattern if the 
  Fuzzy pattern cluster scheme for Breast cancer datasets 
 
412 
 
difference (o – e) is significant enough to indicate that the 
compound event is not a random happening. 
PD is a useful tool for categorical data analysis. First, the 
patterns produced are easy to understand for those who are not 
data mining experts. Hence, it is widely used in business and 
commercial applications. Second, it assumes very little 
knowledge about the data from the users. Thus, when the 
users do not have any a priori knowledge about a data set, PD 
is a good starting point for exploring the data set. Third, 
correlation relationship often reveals useful information 
hidden in the data. Finally, the discovered patterns provide an 
alternative perspective for further analysis of the data. 
B. Pattern Analysis 
Using the discovered patterns, the user can conduct 
inference such as classification. The classifiers built from 
association patterns are known as associative classifiers, 
which may be easier to understand than conventional 
classifiers. In addition, there is no systematic and objective 
way of combining fragments of information from individual 
patterns to produce a more generalized form of information. 
Since there are too many patterns, it is difficult to use them to 
further explore or analyze the data. Hence, the problem of too 
many patterns limits the usefulness of PD. 
In non-fuzzy or hard clustering, data is divided into crisp 
clusters, where each data point belongs to exactly one cluster. 
In fuzzy clustering, the data points can belong to more than 
one cluster, and associated with each of the points are 
membership grades which indicate the degree to which the 
data points belong to the different clusters. 
C. S 
 
The FCM algorithm is one of the most widely used fuzzy 
clustering algorithms. This technique was originally introduced by 
Professor Jim Bezdek in 1981. The FCM algorithm attempts to 
partition a finite collection of elements X={ , , ... , } into a 
collection of c fuzzy clusters with respect to some given criterion. 
Given a finite set of data, the algorithm returns a list of c cluster 
centers V, such that 
V = , i =1, 2, ... , c 
and a partition matrix U such that 
U = , i =1, ..., c, j =1,..., n 
where is a numerical value in [0, 1] that tells the degree to which 
the element belongs to the i-th cluster. 
The following is a linguistic description of the FCM algorithm, 
which is implemented Fuzzy Logic. The functions that implement 
this algorithm can be found in the Clustering.m file. 
Step 1: Select the number of clusters c (2 c n), exponential weight 
(1 < < ), initial partition matrix , and the termination criterion 
. Also, set the iteration index l to 0. 
Step 2: Calculate the fuzzy cluster centers { | i=1, 2, ..., c} by using 
. 
Step 3: Calculate the new partition matrix by using { | i=1, 2, 
..., c}. 
Step 4: Calculate the new partition matrix = || - || = 
| - |. If > , then set l = l + 1 and go to step 2. If , then 
stop. 
V. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A.. Pattern- Induced Data Clusters 
A simultaneous pattern and data clustering method is 
presented. To begin with, the notion of pattern induced data 
clusters is introduced. It relates patterns to the set of 
compound events containing them and makes the relation 
between patterns and their associated data explicit. 
It can be used as a natural threshold for stopping a 
clustering algorithm. It is not possible cluster two rules / 
patterns together if dR > 1, since there is more dissimilarity 
than similarity between the two patterns. It has been reported 
that distance / similarity measures based on matched samples 
such as dT and dG work fairly well for clustering similar 
patterns, because they go back to the samples where the 
patterns / rules share or differ. However, these measures do 
not give special consideration to the attributes where the 
patterns share or differ. As an illustration, consider the two 
pairs of patterns ji
s
j
s
i xx ,  & ri, rj and rij bear the same 
meaning. Ci (Cj) is the number of attributes matched by ( )ji sjsi xx ,    but not by ( )ij sisj xx , . That is, ci = |si \ sj|, and cj 
= |sj \ si|. Let cij be the number of attributes matched by both 
is
ix  and j
s
jx . That is, cij = |si ? sj|. 
The system measures dT, dG, and dR will yield the 
same value for the two pairs of patterns, since ri = rp, rj = rq 
and rij = rpq. However, it seems more reasonable to consider 
that i
s
ix and j
s
jx are more similar, since they share certain 
attributes (cij>0). 
This motivates to introduce the notion of pattern 
induced data cluster I(i) in (6), which consider both the sets of 
matched samples and matched attributes. In Figure.1, the four 
highlighted rectangles are actually the induced data clusters 
I(i), I(j), I(p), and I(q). In addition, when two data clusters, 
say, I(i) and I(j) are merged, the compound events in the upper 
right and bottom left corner regions are added into the merged 
data cluster. The corner regions are defined by 
I (i/j) = {xs ? x | x ? m(i) / m(j), s = sj/si}  -----(6) 
I (j/i) = {xs ? x | x ? m(j) / m(i), s = si/sj}  -----(7) 
where Wr and Wc are the weights of the samples and the 
attributes, respectively. If wr + wc = 1, dRC > =1, again, can be 
used as a natural stopping criterion. The number of matched 
samples and matched attributes are equally important.   wr and 
wc are set to 0.5.  
One problem of the measure dRC is that it does not 
consider the variation within the data clusters. The measures, 
including dT , dG, dR, and dRC, discussed so far are designed to 
measure the distance among patterns. 
This allows us to analyze pattern clusters via their 
associated data clusters by using standard analysis techniques.

A simple technique is introduced for effectively analyzing 
individual data clusters. On the other hand, knowing which set 
of patterns induces which data clusters allows users to use 
understandable patterns for interpreting and validating the data 
clusters. In view of this, it is desirable to simultaneously 
cluster patterns and data and keep their relations explicit. To 
obtain good data clusters the variations could be minimized. 
A common measure of variation/uncertainty for discrete-
valued data is entropy:  
)(log)()( s
Ix
s xPxPIH
s
?
?
=  ….(8) 
where P(xs) is the joint probability distribution of xs, and I is 
the abbreviation of I(1 . . . n). 
However, the number of parameters in estimating 
P(xs) is exponential. For |s| binary variables, it is of order 
O(2|s|).Hence, it is impractical to estimate P(xs) directly due to 
the lack of data in most real-world problems. To reduce the 
number of parameters, this approach adopts a naive 
assumption that the attributes are conditionally independent, 
given a data cluster. The joint entropy is then estimated by 
summing up the entropy of individual attributes: ? ?
? ??

si Ixxx

)(log)()( --- (9) 
where s is the attribute index set of I. P(xi)is the probability of 
xi in I and is estimated by 
I
o
xP ixi =)(   ------- (10) 
where 
ix
o is the observed frequency of xi in I, and |I| is the 
number of  compound  events in I. 
 
The computation complexity of H(I) in (9) is O(|I| |S|). Since 
|s| is usually much smaller than |I|, the complexity could be 
O(|I|), which is linear. All constant clusters have zero entropy. 
For example H(I(1)) = 0, and H(I(2)) = 0. When merging 
patterns x1{3,4,5,6} and x2{7,8,9,10}, the entropy of the merged data 
cluster increases indicating that the variation / uncertainty of 
the clusters increases due to the merging. Note that H(I) is 
bounded as 0 ? H(I) = ?i?s log mi, where mi is the number of 
possible values of the ith attribute. Hence, H(I) in (9) can be 
normalized:

Methods can be applied to analyze the data clusters 
without being heavily affected by noises and the unrelated 
data. Essentially, once patterns and data are clustered by 
pattern clustering in the divide phase, any data analysis 
techniques can be applied to the obtained data clusters in the 
conquer phase. A simple technique is proposed for 
discovering subgroups in a data cluster. To measure the 
interdependence between attributes, a Normalized Mutual 
Information measure Rij between attributes Xi and Xj was 
introduced. 
 
),(

jiH
jiMIRij =   …(12) 
where MI(i,j) and HI(i,j) are the mutual information and joint 
entropy between Xi and Xj, respectively. The higher the 
dependence between attributes Xi and Xj, the higher the MI|i| 
value. Rij = 1 if Xi and Xj are totally dependent, and Rij = 0 if 
they are independent. One advantage of using the normalized 
mutual information is that a hypothesis test can be formulated 
to test for the significance of attribute dependence. Two 
attributes Xi and Xj are interdependent if

Otherwise, the two attributes are false. 
To account for the overall significant dependence of an 
attribute Xi with other attributes, the system introduces the 
sum of normalized interdependency redundancy SR|I| of Xi 
with other attributes Xj for all j, j ? i, in the data cluster.  
 
Thus, ?

where N* is the set of (i,j) attribute pairs satisfying (13). Based 
on SR(i), a simple recursive algorithm is proposed. A sub-
grouping tree is used to discover subgroups in a data.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION 
Data clustering is a time consuming and complex task for 
large data sets. Transaction relationship is used in the pattern 
extraction and clustering process. This concept is applied in 
the simultaneous pattern extraction and clustering scheme. 
The pattern extraction is carried out and clustering process is 
performed with the pattern relationship. Distance measure is 
the important issue in the clustering process. In the integrated 
system the distance measure is estimated for the patterns and 
transaction transfer process is done with the actual 
transactions. 
The simultaneous pattern extraction and clustering 
system is implemented to cluster the breast cancer patient 
diagnosis records. The symptom details are collected from the 
UCI machine-learning repository. The system is tested with 
1000 records in the interval of 200 records. The redundant 
records removal and incomplete records are correction 
operations are performed in the preprocessing stage. Pattern 
extraction, data clustering, pattern clustering and simultaneous 
clustering operations are tested. The pattern extraction is 
performed with different support and confidence level. 
The system uses three metrics to analyze the 
performance of the simultaneous clustering scheme. They are 
memory, process time and fitness point. The simultaneous 
clustering scheme requires 40% more memory than the data-
clustering scheme. The process time reduced 25% than the 
data clustering process. The fitness values show that the 
simultaneous clustering scheme produces more accurate 
clustering than data clustering scheme. 
The simultaneous pattern extraction and clustering 
system is implemented to perform the clustering process in 
minimum time period. The association rule mining techniques 
are used to fetch frequent items. The pattern extraction 
process uses the frequent items. The data-clustering scheme is 
integrated with the pattern clustering mechanism. The system 
uses the patient diagnosis report for the testing process. The 
system can be enhanced with the following features: The 
integrated pattern extraction and clustering scheme is 
implemented with the K-Means clustering algorithm. The 
genetic algorithm can be used in the future development. The 
system can be enhanced to perform the pattern extraction and 
clustering process on image data collections. The current 
system is implemented as a stand-alone application. The 
simultaneous clustering algorithm can be updated for 
distributed environment.
