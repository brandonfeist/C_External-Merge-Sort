Abstract 
Classification Data Mining (DM) Techniques can be a 
very useful tool in detecting and identifying e-banking 
phishing websites. In this paper, we present a novel 
approach to overcome the difficulty and complexity in 
detecting and predicting e-banking phishing website. We 
proposed an intelligent resilient and effective model that 
is based on using association and classification Data 
Mining algorithms. These algorithms were used to 
characterize and identify all the factors and rules in order 
to classify the phishing website and the relationship that 
correlate them with each other. We implemented six 
different classification algorithm and techniques to 
extract the phishing training data sets criteria to classify 
their legitimacy. We also compared their performances, 
accuracy, number of rules generated and speed. A 
Phishing Case study was applied to illustrate the website 
phishing process. The rules generated from the 
associative classification model showed the relationship 
between some important characteristics like URL and 
Domain Identity, and Security and Encryption criteria in 
the final phishing detection rate. The experimental results 
demonstrated the feasibility of using Associative 
Classification techniques in real applications and its 
better performance as compared to other traditional 
classifications algorithms.

1. Introduction 
 
    Phishing websites is a semantic attack which targets the 
user rather than the computer. It is a relatively new 
Internet crime in comparison with other forms, e.g., virus 
and hacking. The phishing problem is a hard problem 
because of the fact that it is very easy for an attacker to 
create an exact replica of a good banking site, which looks 
very convincing to users. The word phishing from the 
phrase “website phishing” is a variation on the word 
“fishing”. The idea is that bait is thrown out with the 
hopes that a user will grab it and bite into it just like the 
fish. In most cases, bait is either an e-mail or an instant 
messaging site, which will take the user to hostile 
phishing websites [7]. The motivation behind this study is 
to create a resilient and effective method that uses Data 
Mining algorithms and tools to detect e-banking phishing 
websites in an Artificial Intelligent technique. Associative 
and classification algorithms can be very useful in 
predicting Phishing websites. It can give us answers about 
what are the most important e-banking phishing website 
characteristics and indicators and how they relate with 
each other. Comparing between different Data Mining 
classification and association methods and techniques is 
also a goal of this investigation since there are only few 
studies that compares  different data mining techniques in 
predicting phishing websites. The paper is organized as 
follows: Section 2 presents the literature review, Section 3 
shows the case studies, Section 4 shows data mining 
phishing approach, Section 5 shows the phishing website 
methodology of the research, Section 6 shows the 
utilization of the DM classification techniques, Section 7 
reveals the experimental results of implementing the 
classification data mining techniques in the phishing 
training data sets and then conclusions and future work 
are given in Section 8. 
2. Literature Review 
 
    Despite growing efforts to educate users and create 
better detection tools, users are still very susceptible to 
phishing attacks. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the 
attacks, it is very difficult to estimate the number of 
people who actually fall victim. A report by Gartner 
estimated the costs at $1,244 per victim, an increase over 
2010 Seventh International Conference on Information Technology

DOI 10.1109/ITNG.2010.117
176
the $257 they cited in a 2004 report [8]. In 2007, Moore 
and Clayton estimated the number of phishing victims by 
examining web server logs. They estimated that 311,449 
people fall for phishing scams annually, costing around 
350 million dollars [30]. There are several promising 
defending approaches to this problem reported earlier. 
One approach is to stop phishing at the email level [2], 
since most current phishing attacks use broadcast email 
(spam) to lure victims to a phishing website. Another 
approach is to use security toolbars. The phishing filter in 
IE8 [11] is a toolbar approach with more features such as 
blocking the user’s activity with a detected phishing site. 
A third approach is to visually differentiate the phishing 
sites from the spoofed legitimate sites. Dynamic Security 
Skins [3] proposes to use a randomly generated visual 
hash to customize the browser window or web form 
elements to indicate the successfully authenticated sites. 
A fourth approach is two-factor authentication, which 
ensures that the user not only knows a secret but also 
presents a security token [4]. However, this approach is a 
server-side solution. Sensitive information that is not 
related to a specific site, e.g., credit card information and 
SSN (Social Security Number), cannot be protected by 
this approach either [12].  Many industrial antiphishing 
products use toolbars in Web browsers, but some 
researchers have shown that security tool bars don’t 
effectively prevent phishing attacks. Authors in [3] 
proposed a scheme that utilises a cryptographic identity-
verification method that lets remote Web servers prove 
their identities. However, this proposal requires changes 
to the entire Web infrastructure (both servers and clients), 
so it can succeed only if the entire industry supports it. In 
[9], the authors proposed a tool to model and describe 
phishing by visualizing and quantifying a given site’s 
threat, but this method still wouldn’t provide an 
antiphishing solution. Another approach is to employ 
certification, e.g., Microsoft spam privacy [28]. A recent 
and particularly promising solution was proposed in [6], 
which combines the technique of standard certificates 
with a visual indication of correct certification. A variant 
of web credential is to use a database or list published by 
a trusted party, where known phishing web sites are 
blacklisted. For example Netcraft, Websense and 
Cloudmark antiphishing toolbars [29], [10], prevents 
phishing attacks by utilising a centralized blacklist of 
current phishing URLs. The weaknesses of this approach 
are its poor scalability and its timeliness. The typical 
technologies of antiphishing from the user interface aspect 
are done by [3] and [12]. They proposed methods that 
need Web page creators to follow certain rules to create 
Web pages, either by adding dynamic skin to Web pages 
or adding sensitive information location attributes to 
HTML code. However, it is difficult to convince all Web 
page creators to follow the rules [5].  In [5], [9], the visual 
similarity of Web pages is oriented, and the concept of 
visual approach to phishing detection was first introduced. 
The Passpet system, created by Yee et al. in 2006, uses 
indicators so that users know they are at a previously-
trusted website [13]. Since all of these proposals require 
the use of complicated third-party tools, its unclear how 
many users will actually benefit from them. The newest 
version of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer supports 
Extended Validation (EV) certificates, coloring the URL 
bar green and displaying the name of the company. 
However, a recent study found that EV certificates did not 
make users less fall for phishing attacks [25]. 
 
3. Case Studies 
 
3.1. Case Study: Phone Phishing Experiment  
 
    For our testing specimen, and after taking all the 
necessary authorization and approval from the 
management, a group of 50 employees were contacted by 
female colleges assigned to lure them into giving away 
their personal ebanking accounts user name and password 
(through social and friendly phone conversation with a 
deceiving purpose in mind). The results were beyond 
expectations; many of the employees fell for the trick. 
After conducting friendly conversation with them for 
some time, our team managed to seduce them into giving 
away their internet banking credentials for fake reasons. 
Some of these lame reasons included checking their 
privileges and accessibility, or for checking its integrity 
and connectivity with the web server for maintenance 
purposes, account security and privacy assurance…etc. 
To assure the authenticity of our request and to give it a 
social dimensional trend, our team had to contact them 
repeatedly for about three or four time. As shown in table 
1, our team managed to deceive 16 out of the 50 
employees to give away their full e-banking credentials 
which represented 32% of the sample. This percentage is 
considered a high one especially when we know that the 
victims were staff members of Jordan Ahli Bank, who are 
supposed to be highly educated with regard to the risks of 
electronic banking services.  
 
Table 1. Phone Phishing Experiment 
 
A total of 16% (8 employees) agreed to give their user 
name only and refrained from giving away their 
passwords under any circumstances or excuses what so 
ever. The remaining 52% (26 employees) were very 
cautious and declined to reveal any information regarding

their credentials over the phone.  An overview of the 
results reveals the high risk of social engineering security 
factor. Social engineering constitutes a direct internal 
threat to e-banking web services since its hacks directly 
into the accounts of e-bank customers. The results also 
show the direct need to increase the awareness of 
customers not to fall victims of this kind of threat that can 
lead to devastating results. 
 
3.2. Case Study: Website Phishing Experiment 
 
    We engineered a website for phishing practice and 
study. The website was an exact replica of the original 
Jordan Ahli Bank website www.ahlionline.com.jo 
designed to trap users and induce them by targeted 
phishing email to submit their credentials (username and 
password). The specimen was inclusive of our colleagues 
at Jordan Ahli Bank after attaining the necessary 
authorizations from our management. We deliberately put 
lots of known phishing features and factors when creating 
the faked website in order to measure the user's awareness 
of these kinds of risk. For example, using IP address 
instead of domain name, http instead of https, poor 
design, spelling errors, absence of SSL padlock icon and 
phony security certificate. We targeted 120 employees 
with our deceiving phishing email,  informing them that 
their e-banking accounts are at the risk of being hacked 
and requested them to log into their account through fake 
link attached to our email using their usual customer ID 
and password to verify their balance and then log out 
normally. As shown in table 2, The website successfully 
attracted 52 out of the 120-targeted employees 
representing 44%, who interacted positively by following 
the deceiving instructions and submitting their actual 
credentials (customer ID, Password). 
 
Table 2. Phishing Website Experiment 
 
Surprisingly IT department employees and IT auditors 
constituted 8 out of the 120 victims representing 7%, 
which shocked me, since we expected them to be more 
alert than others. From other departments 44 employees of 
the 120-targeted employee’s victims representing 37%, 
fell into the trap and submitted their credentials without 
any hesitation. The remaining 68 out of 120 representing 
56% were divided as follows: 28 employees supplied 
incorrect info, which seems to indicate a wary curiosity 
representing 23%; and 40 employees, received the email, 
but did not respond at all representing 33%. The results 
clearly indicate that target phishing factor is extremely 
dangerous since almost half of the employees who 
responded were victimized; particularly, trained 
employees such as those of IT Department and IT 
Auditors. Increasing the awareness of all users of e-
banking regarding this risk factor is highly recommended. 
 
4. Phishing Data Mining Approach 
4.1. Phishing Characteristics and Indicators 
 
    From our previous phishing case studies and 
experiments we managed to gather 27 phishing features 
and indicators and clustered them into six Criteria (URL 
& Domain Identity, Security & Encryption, Source Code 
& Java script, Page Style & Contents, Web Address Bar 
and Social Human Factor ), and each criteria has its own 
phishing components. For example, URL & Domain 
Identity Criteria has five phishing indicator components 
(Using IP address, abnormal request URL, abnormal URL 
of anchor, abnormal DNS record and abnormal URL). 
The full list is shown in table 3 which is used later on our 
analysis and methodology study.  
 
Table 3. Main Phishing Indicators With Its Criteria 
 4.2. Why use  Data Mining? 
 
   Data Mining has been described as "the nontrivial 
extraction of implicit, unknown, and potentially useful 
information from large data sets [18]. It is a powerful new 
technology to help researchers focus on the important 
information in their data archive. Data mining tools 
predict future trends and behaviors, allowing businesses 
to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions [19].

5. Phishing Website  Methodology 
5.1. Data Mining Techniques 
 
    We utilized data mining classification and association 
rule approaches in our new e-banking phishing website 
detection model as shown in figure 1 to find the most 
important phishing features and significant patterns of 
phishing characteristic or factors in the e-banking 
phishing website archive data. Particularly, we used a 
number of different existing data mining association and 
classification techniques including JRip [21], PART [21], 
PRISM [22] and C4.5 [23], CBA [20], MCAR [26] 
algorithms to learn and to compare the relationships of the 
different phishing classification features and rules. The 
experiments of C4.5, RIPPER, PART and PRISM 
algorithms were conducted using the WEKA software 
system [16], which is an open java source code for the 
data mining community that includes implementations of 
different methods for several different data mining tasks 
such as classification, association rule and regression. 
CBA and MCAR experiments were conducted using an 
implementation version provided by the authors of [20], 
[26]. We have chosen these algorithms based on the 
different strategies they use to generate the rules and since 
their learnt classifiers are easily understood by human.  
 
Figure 1. AC Model for Detecting Phishing Websites 
 
We used two web access archives, one from APWG 
archive [1] and one from Phishtank archive [24]. We 
managed to extract the whole 27 phishing security 
features and indicators and clustered them to its 6 
corresponding criteria as mentioned before in table 3.  
 
5.2. Website Phishing Training Data Sets  
 
    Two publicly available datasets were used to test our 
implementation: the “phishtank” from the phishtank.com 
[24] which is considered one of the primary phishing-
report collates both the 2007 and 2008 collections. The 
PhishTank database records the URL for the suspected 
website that has been reported, the time of that report, and 
sometimes further detail such as the screenshots of the 
website, and is publicly available. The Anti Phishing 
Working Group (APWG) which maintains a “Phishing 
Archive” describing phishing attacks dating back to 
September 2007 [2]. A data set of 1006 phishing, 
suspicious and legitimate e-banking websites is used in 
the study (412 row phishing e-banking websites, 288 rows 
suspicious and 306 row of real e-banking websites for the 
legitimate portion of the data set). In addition, 27 features 
are used to train and test the classifiers. We used a series 
of short scripts to programmatically extract the above 
features, and store these in an excel sheet for quick 
reference. Our goal is to gather information about 
classifying and categorizing of all different e-banking 
phishing attacks techniques. By thoroughly investigating 
these phishing attacks we’ve created a data set containing 
information regarding what different techniques have 
been used and how it can be predicted.  
 
5.3. Mining e-Banking Phishing Challenges 
 
   The age of the dataset is the most significant problem, 
which is particularly relevant with the phishing corpus. E-
banking Phishing websites are short-lived, often lasting 
only in the order of 48 hours. Some of our features can 
therefore not be extracted from older websites, making 
our tests difficult. The average phishing site stays live for 
approximately 2.25 days [14]. Furthermore, the process of 
transforming the original e-banking phishing website 
archives into record feature row data sets is not without 
error. It requires the use of heuristics at several steps. 
Thus high accuracy from the data mining algorithms 
cannot be expected. However, the evidence supporting the 
golden nuggets comes from a number different algorithms 
and feature sets and we believe it is compelling [15]. 
 
6. DM Classification Techniques 
 
6.1. Classification Algorithm 
 
    We utilizes six different common DM classification 
algorithms (C4.5, JRip, PART, PRISM, CBA and 
MCAR). Our choice of these methods is based on the 
different strategies they used in learning rules from data 
sets [17].  The C4.5 algorithm [23] employs divide and 
conquer approach, and the RIPPER algorithm uses 
separate and conquer approach. The choice of PART 
algorithm is based on the fact that it combines both 
approaches to generate a set of rules. It adapts separate-
and-conquer to generate a set of rules and uses divide-
and-conquer to build partial decision trees. PRISM is a 
classification rule which can only deal with nominal 
attributes and doesn't do any pruning. It implements a top-
down (general to specific) sequential-covering algorithm 
that employs a simple accuracy-based metric to pick an 
appropriate rule antecedent during rule construction. CBA 
algorithm employs association rule mining [20] to learn 
179
the classifier and then adds a pruning and prediction steps. 
Finally, MCAR algorithm consists of two phases: rules 
generation and a classifier builder. In the first phase, 
MCAR scans the training data set to discover frequent 
single items, and then recursively combines the items 
generated to produce items involving more attributes. 
MCAR then generates, ranks and stores the rules. In the 
second phase, the rules are used to generate a classifier by 
considering their effectiveness on the training data set. 
This results in a classification approach named associative 
classification [26] [27]. MCAR utilizes database coverage 
pruning to decrease the number of rules. Since without 
adding constraints on the rule discovery, the very large 
numbers of rules, make humans unable to understand 
classifier. This pruning technique tests the generated rules 
against the training data set, and only high quality rules 
that cover at least one training instance not considered by 
other higher ranked rules are kept for later classification.  
 
6.2. AC Phishing Approach (MCAR Model) 
 
    Associative Classification is a special case of 
association rule mining in which only the class attribute is 
considered in the rule’s right-hand-side (consequent), for 
example A, BÆY, Then A, B must be input items 
attributes and Y must be the output class attribute. The 
attribute values for all our input items which represent the 
six e-banking phishing features and criteria (URL & 
Domain Identity, Security & Encryption, Source Code & 
Java script, Page Style & Contents, Web Address Bar, and 
Social Human Factor) ranged between three fuzzy set 
values (Genuine, Doubtful and Legitimate) which we 
measured before in our previous paper using Fuzzy Logic 
[31] taking into consideration all the input fuzzy variables 
for all criteria different components as shown in Table 3. 
The output class attribute of our phishing website rate is 
one of these values (Very Legitimate, Legitimate, 
Suspicious, Phishy or Very Phishy). Example of the 
training data sets to be classified is shown in Table 4. 
 
Table 4. Example of Training Phishing Data Sets 
 
To derive a set of class association rules from the training 
data set, it must satisfy certain user-constraints, i.e support 
and confidence thresholds. In association rule mining, any 
item that passes MinSupp is known as a frequent item. A 
sample of the 22 best classification rules generated from 
the MCAR (Multi Class Classification based on 
Association Rule) algorithm which had an accuracy of 
88.4 % and error rate of 12.622 % is shown below. 
Rule 1:  Social_Human_Factor = Fraud 
  Web_Address_Bar = Fraud 
  Page_Style_&_Contents = Doubtful 
  ->  class = Phishing 
Rule 16:  Web_Address_Bar = Genuine 
  Security_&_Encryption = Doubtful 
  URL_Domain_Identity = Doubtful 
  ->  class = Legitimate 
Rule 22:  Social_Human_Factor = Genuine 
  Page_Style_&_Contents = Doubtful 
  ->  class = Suspicious 
   We recorded the prediction accuracy and the number of 
rules generated by the traditional classification algorithms 
and the new associative classification approaches we used 
in Table 5 and 6 respectively. Experiments were 
conducted using stratified ten-fold cross-validation. Error 
rate comparative chart is shown in figure 2.

databases. It showed that there is a significant relation between 
the two phishing website criteria’s (URL & Domain Identity) 
and  (Security & Encryption) for identifying e-banking phishing 
website, taking into consideration its characteristic association 
and relationship with each others (Ex.: Conflict relationship of 
using SSL certificate VS the abnormal URL request). Also we 
found insignificant trivial influence of the (Page Style & 
Content) criteria along with (Social Human Factor) criteria for 
identifying e-banking phishing websites. The number of rules 
extracted from the PRISM algorithms is the highest since it 
doesn’t do any pruning process. Finally, the experiment results 
showed that the proposed associative classification MCAR 
algorithm outperformed all other traditional classification in 
terms of accuracy and speed (Err. Rate: 12.622 %) since it 
requires only one phase to discover frequent items and rules. 
 
8. Conclusion and Future Work 
    E-banking phishing website model based on 
classification data mining showed the significance 
importance of the phishing website two criteria’s (URL & 
Domain Identity) and (Security & Encryption) in the final 
phishing detection rate, and also showed the insignificant 
trivial influence of some other criteria like  ‘Page Style & 
content’  and ‘Social Human Factor’ in the final phishing 
rate. The rules generated from the associative 
classification model showed the correlation and 
relationship between some of their characteristics which 
can help us in building phishing website detection system. 
The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using 
Associative Classification techniques in real applications 
involving large databases and its better performance as 
compared to other traditional classification algorithms, 
[Ex: MCAR (Err. Rate : 12.622 %)]. As for future work, 
we want to use different pruning methods like lazy 
pruning [26] which discards rules that incorrectly classify 
training instances and keeps all other rules to be used by 
MCAR associative classification technique in order to 
minimize the size of the resulting classifiers and to 
experimentally measure and compare the effect of these 
different pruning on the final result.
