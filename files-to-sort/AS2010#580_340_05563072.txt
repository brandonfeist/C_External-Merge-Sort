Abstract-- Presently, in the data mining scenario clustering 
of large dataset is one of the very important techniques 
widely applied to many applications including social 
network analysis. Applying more specific pre-processing 
method to prepare the data for clustering algorithms is 
considered to be a significant step for generating meaningful 
segments. In this paper we propose an innovative clustering 
technique called the Rapid Clustering Method (RCM), 
which uses Subtractive Clustering combined with Fuzzy C-
Means clustering along with a histogram sampling 
technique to provide quick and effective results for large 
sized datasets. Rapid Clustering Method can be used to 
cluster the dataset and analyze the characteristics in a social 
network. It can also be used to enhance the cross-selling 
practices using quantitative association rule mining. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Analysis of social networks is heavily dependent on 
clustering algorithms. The existing clustering algorithms 
such as K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) etc have their 
own pros and cons. K-Means is very fast but its center value 
is dependent on the initial assumptions. We obtain different 
centers for different initial conditions. FCM is much more 
consistent than K-Means and is independent of initial 
assumptions [1]. It is more of a probabilistic approach, but 
its convergence rate to a center is very slow. Though 
Subtractive Clustering Method (SCM) is used to speed up 
the process [2], the time taken by the combined algorithms 
is much higher than K-Means. We have proposed a novel 
method for sampling the dataset during the process of 
applying SCM and FCM methods together to reduce the 
time complexity. The following section explains how 
Histogram Sampling [3] is applied along with SCM-FCM. 
The Histogram sampling technique is preferred as it takes 
lesser time for computation and also maintains the density 
of the original dataset [4]. Then a time comparison between 
K-Means, SCM-FCM and RCM is shown. For applying this 
method in telecom industry can improve the cross-selling of 
customer services which is explained with an example to the 
voice counts of a particular telecom network. The cross-
selling efficiency is improved when quantitative association 
rule mining is applied to clustered data rather than the full 
dataset, which helps us identify the potential customers 
more accurately. Moreover the use of RCM effectively in 
identifying overlapping nodes in social network structures  
is also discussed subsequently.  
II. RAPID CLUSTERING METHOD 
The Rapid Clustering Method (RCM) consists of three 
different parts. First the dataset is sampled to obtain a 
smaller dataset using histogram sampling technique, then 
SCM-FCM is applied to the sampled dataset and the cluster 
centers are obtained. These cluster centers are used in SCM 
implementation and finally FCM is applied to the larger 
dataset.  
 The purpose of reducing the dataset is that the 
order of execution of SCM is n2, thus larger the dataset 
more time it consumes to find the cluster centers. The 
histogram sampling technique is applied so as to maintain 
the density values similar to that of the original dataset so 
that we obtain the same cluster centers for the sample 
dataset. 
 
     Figure 1. Example of Histogram Sampling technique 
 
Figure.1 illustrates the results of histogram sampling 
method for five ranges varies from 1 to 50. The novelty of 
this work is to use the sampling method to speed up cluster 
initialization for fuzzy c-means. On appending this 
technique to existing SCM-FCM produces rapid results. The 
original dataset is segmented into various smaller intervals 
and equal proportion of the data points from each interval is 
taken and a smaller dataset is constructed. The interval size 
is determined based on the data distribution. If the 
distribution is uniform then data can be split into larger 
intervals. Otherwise smaller intervals can be used to 
increase the accuracy level of prediction. When data is 
concentrated more in a particular interval compared to other 
intervals then that interval is subdivided into smaller 
intervals and equal proportion of data is taken from those 
smaller intervals.

SCM is applied on a sample dataset to obtain the initial 
cluster centers. This is further iterated to obtain consistent 
cluster centers. Using these cluster centers, FCM is applied 
to the original larger dataset to obtain the required cluster 
groups. 
III. EVALUATION 
 
The proposed method is applied to a dataset of 1208473 
entries of voice counts for each subscriber in a huge telecom 
network and the time taken for clustering is calculated. 
Similarly SCM-FCM and K-Means are also applied to the 
same dataset and their respective time of execution is noted 
for comparison. The cluster centers C1 and C2 obtained by 
both SCM-FCM and RCM are given below, 
C1= 40.64427 and C2=206.3012 
 
Figure 2. Execution Time Comparison 
Figure.2 shows the comparison between the three 
algorithms. RCM obtains the same result as SCM-FCM but 
in a much quicker time, which is even faster than the K-
Means method. Thus RCM rectifies the initial conditions 
dependency of K-Means and also increased the execution 
speed of SCM-FCM. Moreover, we have observed the 
improvement in the level of accuracy.  
 
IV. APPLICATIONS OF RAPID CLUSTERING 
METHOD 
 
A. Cross selling using Association Rule Mining  
In the current scenario of cross-selling high and low 
usage clusters provide optimum results with minimum 
complexity or overheads [5]. The Rapid clustering 
algorithm is applied to cluster a given set of voice usage 
counts into two clusters namely high and low usage clusters. 
Rapid Clustering is not used only to obtain two clusters; it 
can be used to obtain as many clusters as required by the 
user. Each cluster consists of the service usage counts and 
the optimum time to advertise the services apart from 
customer ID and MSISDN of the subscriber. The cross-
selling efficiency is determined by three parameters, 
support, confidence and lift; these parameters describe the 
association strength and the increase in success rates for a 
combination of services. Quantitative Association Rule 
mining is the process of applying association rules and 
identifying the lift for clustered results [5]. In this case the 
lift values for the High and Low usage Clusters are 
identified and the services to be cross-sold are identified. A 
single service is used to check for the association strength 
with all the other services within the reach of usage counts. 
B. Identifying community structures in Social 
Network Analysis  
 The application of RCM in social network analysis 
comes in the form of clustering the modularity values of 
nodes in two different networks and identify whether the 
nodes are over lapping or not. When the probabilistic 
analysis is made for clustering, the nodes are said to overlap 
if the probability pair is like (0.6, 0.4) for the two 
communities. In other words, if the values are one sided say 
(0.9, 0.1) the nodes are not allowed to overlap. This kind of 
analysis is very important when a subscriber is to be labeled 
based on the communities available in the network. RCM 
can also be used at regular intervals to identify the changes 
occurring in community structures with respect to time. 
Identifying change in community structure is a very 
important task in social network analysis. With the help of 
RCM we can obtain rapid results and identify structural 
changes much more quickly. 
V. CONCLUSION 
 
We considered the problem of clustering data over time and 
proposed a rapid clustering technique so that it can be used 
to generate quicker results for social network analysis.We 
have proved that rapid clustering algorithm works better 
than K-Means and SCM-FCM in a lesser time period and 
also by maintaining the level of accuracy. This proves that 
RCM is a good alternative method for segmenting large 
dataset on a telecom domain. RCM saves the time in 
clustering and is useful for identifying the changes 
occurring in community structures in the network very 
quickly and also helps in labeling the customers based on 
the communities they belong..
