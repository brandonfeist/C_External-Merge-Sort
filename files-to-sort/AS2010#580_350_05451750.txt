Abstract—The goal of privacy preserving association rule is to 
find an approach of the original data set, making the relevant 
sensitive rules not to be found in a process of data mining. In 
order to efficiently achieve privacy preserving, this paper 
proposes an effective method for privacy preserving 
association rule. Trough the way of combining the basic 
strategies of PPARM algorithm and IMBA which are 
improved, making less-sensitive operations, a greater degree of 
hiding can be made while a less degree impact for the non-
sensitive rules can be made too. Theoretical and experimental 
results show that the algorithm is highly efficient, and can 
ensure the privacy preserving better.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, data mining based on privacy preserving 
has become a hot spot of database study. Association rules 
are researched popularly too. Association rule mining is to 
find the interesting relationship and interrelationship of item 
sets among the mass data. The privacy preserving of 
association rule is an operation done to hide the sensitive 
rules aimed to frustrate the data user’s attempt to mine the 
data from its owner before the process of association rule 
mining. To implement the privacy preserving of data, we 
need to consider the follow two points: One is how to ensure 
the privacy not to be revealed during data application process. 
Another is how to make it better for data application. At 
present, the study of privacy preserving is concentrated on 
how to design a better algorithm while balance the two 
points mentioned above [2]. 
As for the privacy preserving of association rule, SWA [1] 
based on heuristic algorithm has been advanced recently. 
However, SWA algorithm doesn’t take the effect of the non-
sensitive rules into consideration. Document [3] advanced a 
new transpose privacy protection algorithm based on SWA 
algorithm. Through a proper shift of the sensitive set, it can 
hide the sensitive set while lessen the effect of non-sensitive 
set. However, it doesn’t take the cost of the shift of the 
sensitive set into consideration. Document [3] advanced a 
method to choose the proper sensitive sets to be deleted 
while lessen the supportability of other sets which are in the 
assemblages of sensitive sets. However, it doesn’t take the 
effect of the non-sensitive rules into consideration. On the 
 
 
basis of the algorithms mentioned above, this paper 
advanced an Association rule mining algorithm based on 
privacy preserving (SWTA). Through the proper 
combination of the two algorithms, it can make the least data 
managements on the original data base while hide the 
sensitive item sets as many as possible and lessen the effect 
of non-sensitive sets in item sets. This method can solve the 
problem of association rule privacy preserving better. 
II. DEFINITION OF TERMS 
Definition 1: sensitive rules: all the rules needed to be 
hidden by the data owner are called sensitive rule. 
Definition 2: affair sensitive sets: all the sets contained in 
sensitive rules. 
Definition 3: rule loss rate: the rate of the loss of original 
association rules after hiding the sensitive rules. 
Definition 4: affair refresh rate: the occupancy of the 
amount of affairs needs to be changed in the whole affairs at 
the situation of the same supportability and confidence level. 
Definition 5: transpose candidate affair: affair T is the 
proper subset of T1 exclusive I. If we shift I of T1 to T, we 
can make the supportability of Ri (assemblage of sensitive 
item sets) reduce 1 degree, and then T will be the transpose 
candidate affair of I in T1 which specifics to Ri.  
Definition 6: the best transpose candidate affair: if there 
are several Ti which are transpose candidate affairs of Ti, the 
closest T1 will be the best transpose candidate affair of I in 
T1 which specifics to Ri. 
Definition 7: Sj is the jst sensitive item set in assemblages 
of sensitive item sets SI, SI={S1, S2, ?Sj, ?Si} ?if the 
algorithms is processing Sj, then SI’={Sj+1,Sj+2,?Si}. 
Definition 8: The multiplicity of a item in Sj marked as 
Num (item, Sj, SI’, Tj), that is, the number of item in the 
item sets appeared in Tj from SI’ (sensitive item sets). 
Definition 9: Association rule mining: make I={i1, i2, i3, 
i4, ??im}, is the item sets of the data base of DB, T={T1, 
T2, T3, ?? Tm} is the assemblage of all the affairs in the 
original data base. All the items contained in Tj are the 
subsets of I. association rule are a kind of expression like--X
?Y, with x and y is a non-intersect item sets, that is, xy?
 . The intensity of association rules can be expressed by 
support and confidence. Its mathematical formula is:  
Support (xy) = |x y? ?/ N ? 
Confidence (xy) =|x y? | / |x|?

X and y are the proper subsets of I. N is the number of 
affairs contained in data base of DB; |x?y| is the number of 
the same affair in x and y. ?x? is the number of affairs of x 
contained in DB. Then, association rule mining is the rule of 
the threshold of minsupp and minConf whose supportability 
and confidence level are bigger than their preliminary 
definition. 
III. SWTA ALGORITHM  
A. Algorithm theory 
As is showed by the table I (the data base DB), item set 
I={A, B, C, D, E, F}, if a set of one affair appeared in the 
affair, then its value is 1,otherwise, it is 0. As for sensitive 
item set assemblage SI, SI={S1, S2, ?Sj?Si}, if we mine 
the data base DB with the traditional association rule mining 
algorithm, there will be sensitive item set Sj   to be found. It 
means that item sets Sj   is the sensitive item set assemblage 
needing to be hidden. As a result, the traditional data mining 
algorithm can not meet the need of privacy preserving. 
According to the definition of association rule, on the 
premise of invariability of   N and x, if we lessen the value of 
y properly, then we can lessen the supportability and 
confidence level of rule x?y until to the minimum threshold 
required. SWA [1] is to find the sensitive item set whose 
frequency is high in a sensitive item set assemblage and 
delete it. However, it will affect the non-sensitive item set. If 
T1 is a long transaction, the non-sensitive item sets whose 
supportability is lessening become more. Then, the result 
will be that sensitive item sets are lessening while the 
supportability of the non-sensitive item sets will be affected 
largely. In order to lessen the effect of non-sensitive item set, 
we shift the sensitive item set of sensitive rule with the 
method of transpose. In this way, we can make the effect to 
non-sensitive item sets to a minimum degree. With the 
method of IMBA [1], we can use transpose to lessen the effect 
of non-sensitive rule to a minimum degree and protect non-
sensitive rule better. However, it doesn’t take the cost of the 
shift of the sensitive set into consideration. 
The material algorithm can be described as the follows: 
As for the frequent item sets needed to be hidden, for 
example, Sj(Sj?SI , Sj?Ti)?from Ti that contains Sj  , we 
can shift the proper item of Sj , with |x?y|=|x?y|-1,the 
values of N and |x| keep invariant. Keep repeating this step 
until Support (x ?  y) ?  |x ?  y| / N < minSupp or 
Confidence (x? y)=|x? y|/|x|?minConf. Then, find the 
affair Tk(Tk  Ti ? Sj  Tk=  ),and take the item sets 
needed to be shift to Tk. while the difference of the length of 
the affairs Ti and Tk is shortest, the supportability of sensitive 
item sets lessens, and the effect of the supportability of the 
non-sensitive is less. 
B. Illustration 
Affair library table one, {T1: ABCD, T2: CD, T3: ABCD 
EF,T4:BDF,T5:ABCD,T6:BCF,T7:ABD,T8:BCDEF}, 
specifies the minimum supportability as 40%, the minimum 
confidence level as 60%.Counting support{A?B}=4/8=50%, 
and confidence{ A?B }=4/4=100%. With the algorithm of 
PPARM, we can find that a=1, b=2, k=min (a, b) =1. What 
we need to do is to delete one time of the sensitive affair that 
contains item B, and then, its confidence level will be 
lessened to 37.5%<40%, which meets the requirement. If we 
use the traditional Apriori algorithm, we can get 9 
association rules. Supposing rule A?B, B?F, E?F is 
sensitive rules, then the sensitive item sets assemblage is 
SI={{A, B}, {B, F}, {E, F}}, and the processing sensitive 
item sets assemblage is S1={A, B}. Then, the sensitive item 
sets assemblage to be proceeded is SI’={{B, F}, {E, F}}, 
Num (B, {A, B}, SI’, T1)=1,Num=(A, {A, B}, SI’, 
T1)=0.we can learn that if we shift A from T1, it will not 
affect the sensitive item sets of SI’, if we shift B, it will 
affect the sensitive sets assemblage {B, F} of SI. In order to 
lessen the times of modifying the data base, we will shift out 
the sensitive item set with a bigger Num value according to 
the selections of algorithm. Then, it can ensure to hide the 
sensitive item set while lessen the supportability of the 
sensitive item set assemblage to be processed. If the Num 
value of different subjects in Sj is the same, then we will 
choose to shift the item with a lower supportability. The goal 
of this action is to lessen the times of modifying the data 
base. Then we will reach the situation of shifting the data 
less while hiding the sensitive rule more. 
TABLE I. AFFAIR DATA LIBRARY 
TID A B C D E F 
T1 1 1 1 1 0 0 
T2 0 0 1 1 0 0 
T3 1 1 1 1 1 1 
T4 0 1 0 1 0 1 
T5 1 1 1 1 0 0 
T6 0 1 1 0 0 1 
T7 1 1 0 1 0 0 
T8 0 1 1 1 1 1 
At the same time, we need to consider that if we shift B, 
the supportability of AB lessens to a degree under the 
minimum, then, we should take all the modes affected by the 
shifting of B into consideration: AB, BC, BD, ABD, BCD, 
and ABCD. Due to the shifting of B, the supportability of the 
three non-sensitive sets (BC, BD, and BCD) lessens 1 degree. 
As a result, although we hide sensitive AB, we affect the 
supportability of non-sensitive rule.  If we shift B of T1 to T2, 
the supportability reduced to a degree under the minimum, 
and while the supportability of the one contains AB reduces 
1 degree, it doesn’t affect the supportability of other non-
sensitive item sets. Then, T2 is the best transpose candidate 
affair of T1.Through this, it can make the least data 
managements on the original data base while hide the 
sensitive item sets as many as possible and lessen the effect 
of non-sensitive sets in item sets.

IV. ANALYTICAL PROOF OF THE ALGORITHM 
 a=mod ?D ?× (Supp (x y)? - minSupp)) +1 
 Proof: supposing that after we delete y from several 
a (the number of the affair containing x and y 
together), we can make the supportability of the rule 
meet the requirement to hide this association rule. 
That is, ||x y|? -a|/|D|< minSupp, after minkowski: 
|x y|? -|D|×minSupp<a,So, min a = mod (?D ?× 
(Supp(x y)? -minSupp))+1. 
 b=mod (?D ?× (Supp (x y)? -minConf×Supp (x))) 
+1. 
 Proof: supposing that after we delete y from several 
b (the number of the affair containing x and y 
together), we can make the confidence level of the 
rule meet the requirement to hide this association 
rule. That is, ||x y|? -b|/|x|<minConf,after minkowski: 
|x y|? -|x|×minConf <b.So,min b =mod (?D ?× 
(Supp(x  y)? -minConf ×Supp(x))) +1. 
V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
All the data we have used in this experiment is from 
affair assemblage D produced from IBM Almaden Research 
Center, and the parameter is T10, I4, D10k, and N100. That 
is, each affair has 10 sets on average, the average length of 
frequent item sets assemblage is 4, the total number of affairs 
is 100 00, the total item sets is 100. In order to test the effect 
of algorithm, the paper builds 3 evaluating indicators: the 
first one is rule loss rate; the second one is affair refresh rate; 
the last one is the hide performance ratio (specific to 
sensitive rule). This experiment used MATLAB emulation 
program. The result can be shown in the chart below:

We can learn from the chart that: Compared with 
PPARM, this method solved the problem of affecting the 
non-sensitive rules and the rule loss rate became lower 
obviously. Compared with IMBA, this method solved the 
problem of selecting ways to deal with the sensitive sets of 
sensitive rule and made the refresh time of affairs much 
lower. The refresh rate became lower obviously under the 
situation of the same hide performance.
VI. CONCLUSION 
On the basis of PPARM and IMBA algorithm, this paper 
advanced a new algorithm to take the advantages of them 
and combine them together, it can make the least data 
managements on the original data base while hide the 
sensitive item sets as many as possible and lessen the effect 
of non-sensitive sets in item sets. And its validity was proved
