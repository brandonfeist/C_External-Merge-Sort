Abstract 
  Fuzzy temporal association rules can take into 
account the temporal requirements of the user which 
tend to be ill-defined or uncertain. However, fuzzy 
temporal association rules still have some 
shortcomings: firstly, neglecting the effect of all kinds 
of potential negative examples that affect its expression 
capability; secondly, probably showing no practical 
significance or even misleading even if it possesses 
high confidence and support. In this paper, the 
relativity-based interest measure value is introduced 
based on the fuzzy calendar-based temporal 
association rules, and a fuzzy calendar-based temporal 
association rules mining algorithm with interest 
measure is also proposed. Finally, this algorithm was 
applied to the prediction of telemetry data from the 
power system of small satellite. It was proved that this 
algorithm has a good effect and feasibility. 
Keywords: Association rule, Interest measure, Fuzzy

1. Introduction 
 
  Recently, discovery of temporal association rule has 
drawn more and more attention. Users are hard to 
specify the temporal requirements accurately. Thus a 
fuzzy calendar-based algebra is developed to allow 
users to describe desired temporal requirements in 
fuzzy calendars easily and naturally. A fuzzy 
calendar-based temporal association rules was 
proposed by Wan-Jui Lee [1]. A advanced 
multidimensional time series fuzzy association rules 
was proposed by Wei-Hong Guo [2]. A fuzzy temporal 
association rules within valid time intervals was 
proposed by Yan Pan [3], and an algorithm based on 
FP-tree is devised for mining temporal association 
rules.  
  Fuzzy temporal association rules possess high 
confidence and support. In practice, it’s quite not 
enough if just possess high confidence and support. 
Considering the impact of negative examples, the rules 
will have no practical significance or even mislead 
users. It is not the credibility of or support is not high, 
but even if it has a high degree of confidence and 
support, the actual value of the rules has been difficult 
to ensure. That is to say, their interest has been 
generated reduced. Thus we have proposed a solution, 
the introduction of the third threshold –Interest 
measure. Bing He [4] proposed a interest measure 
based association algorithm, introduce the interest 
measure into association rules, improve the actual 
value of association rules. 
These deficiencies are the problem must confront in

 practical applications. To have a wider range of real 
value, we need to improve the practical significance of 
fuzzy temporal association rules. To deal with the 
aforementioned problems of fuzzy calendar-based 
temporal association rules, a new approach make use 
of relativity-based interest measure value presented in 
association rules is proposed in this paper. The 
algorithm was applied to the prediction of data from 
the power system of small satellite, and its effects 
turned out to be good, the practicality of the algorithm 
is proved to be satisfied. 
 
2. Problem Solution 
 
In this section we will introduce the conception of 
interest measure. The definition of the improved 
interest measure and our proposed fuzzy 
calendar-based temporal association rules will also be 
given.  
 
2.1 The Introduction of Interest Measure 
 
  Degrees of interest are used to perform users’ 
concerns of the rules. Such metrics are users’ 
comprehensive measure of the simplicity, certainty, 
practicality and novelty of rules. Mining at different 
goals and different mining environment, the degree of 
the rule which a user’s concern with is different. For 
example, the rule that "at a certain period of time, 
many cash flow happened through a group of people", 
when the mining is designed to identify potential bank 
customers, this rule is not much effect; when mining 
aimed at distinguish the criminal, this rule will be great 
concern because of crime are at a certain period of time 
happened many cash-flow anomaly. Interest measure 
of the rules consists of directive interest and objective 
interest.  
Current research focuses on the objective interest. 
Objective interest is the user's objective concern about 
rules. It is mainly depend on the specific structure and 
data used in the mining process of the rules. This kind 
of measurement has the generality. To avoid too many 
people’ views about the rules affect the effectiveness, 
statistical methods is applied to the definition of rules, 
thus ensuring its effectiveness. 
According to the improved definition of association 
rules proposed by Hao Feng Zhou, etc.[5]and the 
definition of interest based on relevance proposed by 
Han, etc.[6], this paper analyzes the deficiencies of 
interest in the existing mining algorithm and improved 
fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules 
algorithm. 
 
2.2 Definition of Improved Association Rules 
and Interest Measure 
 
Credibility-support threshold of fuzzy time series 
association rules cannot account for the negative 
situations. For example, we cannot get a rule that can 
be used to express the situation: the possibility for 
customers to buy the cookies and will not buy the milk 
is 20%, and 52% of the transaction records is not 
bought cookies and milk at the same time. 
Obviously, such purchase trends (that is, bought 
cookies and do not buy milk) in real life are likely to 
exist. However, because of the definition for fuzzy 
time series association rules, the results in data mining 
will lose very useful information. 
Considering the negative situations, the association 
rules can be defined as the following forms to solve the 
problems above. That is, the definition of the 
association rules can be written as the following forms 
of implicit formula: 
Definition 5(Modified association rules)  1p ? 2p
?…? lp ? 1lp + ? 2lp + ?…? np ? 1q ? 2q
?…? kq ? 1kq + ? 2kq + ?…? mq ?2?where 
{ 1p ? 2p ?…? np } ? I? { 1q ? 2q ?…? mq } ? 
I? { 1p ? 2p ?…? np }?{ 1q ? 2q ?…? mq } = ? ?
29
 And ip ?T? jq ?T? 'ip ?T? 'jq ?T ?1?i?l?
l+1?i’?n, 1?j?k? k+1?j’?m? for each transaction 
log/record T that supports the rules.  
Thus, we can express the sentence above as follows: 
‘coffee’? ' 'milk ?C= 0.20?S= 0.52 
Here, the relevant concept of probability is giving 
before the definition of interest measure. 
The probability of the possibility of the incident can 
be described as: happened probability of case X in 
transactions can be express as P (X). P?XY?is the 
probability that case X and Y happened at the same 
time. Thus, if P?XY?= P?X?P?Y?, while the 
definition the case X and Y in transactions is 
independent of each other, if P?XY?? P?X?P?Y?, 
while the case X and Y in transactions is not 
independent of each other (that is case X and Y 
relevant). 
According to association rules and the definition of 
probability, we can see: 
Supp?XY?=P?XY? 
Supp?X?=P?X? 
Supp?Y?=P?Y? 
Definition 6(Interest Measure based on 
Correlation)   Given transaction set D, the interest 
measure of the association rules X?Y on D is defined 
as: 
RI = ,X YCorr = ( )
( ) ( )
Supp XY
Supp X Supp Y
= ( )
( ) ( )
P XY
P X P Y
 
Where, 
,X YCorr  is the relevant degree of the rules, 
When 
,X YCorr >1, case X appearence and case Y 
appearence are positive correlation; when 
,X YCorr <1, 
they are negative correlation; when
,X YCorr =1, they are 
independent of each other. 
Definition 7(Improved Association Rules) Given 
translation set D, the association rules X?Yon D, the 
support threshold min_sup, confidence threshold and 
interest measure Ri .Only if Supp ? min_sup?Conf ? 
min_conf? RI ? Ri > 1 are established, said X?Y for 
the improved association rules. Where Ri is defined by 
users. 
In this way, the mining criterion of the entire 
association rules are unified within the framework of 
probability theory. From the perspective of probability 
of relevance, The support reflects whether an item/case 
set in transactions is a general rule; The confidence 
reflects the direction of rules relationship, that is, from 
X to Y or from Y to X; The interest measure reflects 
the relationship among association rules, by which we 
can see how close between X and Y. 
 
3. Improved Fuzzy Calendar-based 
Temporal Association Rules Mining 
Algorithm 
 
  Based on the analysis above, a fuzzy calendar-based 
temporal association rules within interest measure is 
proposed, its basic idea is as follows: 
1? The transaction database is divided into n zones
? 1D ? 2D ?…? nD ?, each partition includes 
only the basic time period determined by the 
smallest fuzzy calendar time granularity (such 
as the minimum time granularity is days ,then 
the basic time period is one day) of transactions, 
calculating the weight of each partition (degree 
of membership), as well as generate positive 
frequent itemsets L.  
2? Filtered all frequent itemsets generated by the 
first step using the weighted confidence level 
and interest threshold, resulting in the usual 
sense of the association rules.  
3? Considering the negative of the association 
rules of which interest less than one, as they 
30
 meet the weighted confidence level and 
threshold of interest measure, then generate the 
association rules. 
 
4. Algorithm application 
 
Here is an example of the power system’s remote 
sensing data of a certain type of satellite. According to 
previous theory of Association Rules Data Mining, we 
should firstly transform satellite’s remote sensing data 
into the form of itemset, which is formed by the cases 
happened in different channel during the same period. 
The format of each item in itemset is # # # * XX, all in 
the form of Arabic numerals. The top three figures 
represent the channel number, where to fill “0” in front 
when the data is not three-figure. The fourth figure 
represents the transform direction, which "0" on behalf 
of lower, and "1" on behalf of higher. The last two 
figures represent the extent of change, which is in the 
form of percentage. In addition, when data does not 
change, the latest three digits should be "000". For 
example, the output change of above-mentioned 
27-volt voltage regulator can be expressed as 057103, 
meaning that the data increased by 3%. In this way, 
taking the cases happened during the same period as an 
itemset, which would be arranged in chronological 
order, we can finally get a generate of a text file as 
input of Association Rules Mining at last. 
The mining job of Spacecraft’s channel data 
association rules is carried out at Matlab programming 
environment. Procedure’s Frequent Itemset search 
algorithm is using the above-mentioned calendar fuzzy 
association rules algorithm.  Aimed at mining the 
output voltage change of Satellite power subsystem’s 
nickel-cadmium battery pack, firstly we get a 
generation of data files to be excavated, and then do 
the mining job applying the fuzzy calendar temporal 
association rules with Interest Measure, and finally 
obtain Interested Association Rules which is extracted 
from the data files. Rules listed in Table 4-1 can be 
used to guide the AHP algorithm to determine the 
structure of the matrix. Table 4-2 has listed the 
negative association rules which can be used to guide 
the AHP algorithm to determine the matrix structure. 
From the mining results of association rules, we can 
see the Association Rules of mining process come to 
an agreement with experts’ judgement. 
  Application of the mining results of Association 
Rules in AHP algorithm prediction causal adjustment 
[7], [8]. Take spacecraft data as research object, and a 
certain satellite’s nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery pack 
voltage as prediction variables, we have studied some 
key factors that affect variables, and calculated factors’ 
adjustment coefficient to prediction variables. 
Therefore, we can add temporal adjustment factors to 
prediction process, and modify the causal prediction 
method without considering the causal affection. Based 
on this method, we have predicted the Ni-Cd battery 
pack voltage, and added the casual adjustment 
algorithm to original prediction model, and then 
multiplied the current changing value of each affecting 
factors by corresponding total adjustment coefficient, 
and then plus the output of prediction model, and 
estimate the prediction interval at the confidence level 
95%. The result is showed in Figure 4-1 and Fig 4-2. 
Fig4-1 is casual adjustment when doing data mining 
job by using Apriori algorithm, while Fig 4-2 is the 
result after casual adjustment using interested fuzzy 
calendar casual associated rules. It can be seen clearly 
that the later method increase prediction accuracy 
greatly, and reduce the prediction interval along with 
the increase of accuracy.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The potential problems of considering only 
confidence and support on the existing fuzzy 
calendar-based algorithm for mining temporal 
association rules is discussed in this paper. Firstly, the 
association rules do not consider all the capable 
negative influence of sample, and after the 
modification of definition of the association rules, we 
31
 found that though one rule get high confidence and 
support, it still have no actual significance even 
misleading. Therefore, we put forward an idea about 
adding a threshold value based on the correlation 
interest measure, and give out formal definition and 
practical significance. The rules are considered as 
interested and mined, only if the threshold value of the 
rules is higher than the designated interest measure. 
Finally, the algorithm is proved that it is effective in 
the data prediction on the power system of a small 
satellite.
