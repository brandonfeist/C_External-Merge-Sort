I. INTRODUCTION 
The most general design process includes integrated 
circuit chip design, electronic circuit design, PCB design and 
circuit simulation analysis [1-2], while various EDA 
softwares are used in electronic circuit design. Circuit-debug 
technical requirement and the related document preparation 
is the last work to do in electronic product designing, and it 
is an important step to decide whether the product finally 
meets the design requirement. However, the generation of 
the circuit-debug prepared documents is mainly completed 
by designers and technologists, who depend on their personal 
experience and common word processing softwares. The 
form and content of these documents vary badly from 
different workers, and it is hard to achieve efficiency, 
integrality, normalization and intelligence. When a large 
number of EDA design information can not be shared and 
reused, it will likely occurs the situation that the generated 
circuit-debug document disaccord with its standard, thus 
affects the debug effectiveness of electronic products. So 
how to rely on the specification for generating debug 
document, extract useful data from a mass of debug 
information, rapidly and normatively generating circuit­
debug document such as circuit-debug syllabus, circuit­
debug rules, circuit-debug process files, has become an 
important research area for the variety, changeful electronic 
products. 
Currently, the research on automatically generating 
circuit-debug document is not perfect. There are some 
technologies for syllabus generation, but they have 
disadvantages of imperfect process, slow rate, without 
reusability and inheritability [1]. For the mass information of 
circuit-debug process, there is no effective method to dig out 
the implicate association and potential knowledge, being lack 
of intelligence. 
After a deep study of mining algorithms and automatic 
generation technologies, a model for automatically 
generating circuit-debug document based on Apriori 
association rules algorithm is presented, and the model is 
validated in the end. The system with the presented 
technology has been already applied to the national defense 
research undertaken by the author, and attained remarkable 
achievements.

DOCUMENT 
In the process of electronic circuit design, the designers 
use various EDA softwares to produce a series of design files, 
from the schematic, PCB layout, to the waveform, functional 
verification simulation diagram, BOM file and so on. These 
data files contain a large amount of designing, processing, 
debugging and assembling information, condensing the 
designers' skill and wisdom [3-4], which are supporting data 
for automatically generating document. The model for 
automatically generating circuit-debug document is shown in 
Figure 1. It mainly consists of three parts, automatically 
extracting and transforming heterogeneous EDA design data, 
mining debug information and forming knowledge base, 
module for automatically generating circuit-debug document. 
By fusing a variety of heterogeneous EDA design files, 
automatically extracting the necessary design parameters, 
process parameters and debug information, the data is 
deposited into debug information database. Association rules 
are mined based on the Apriori algorithm, by retrieving 
valuable rules of the debug information and forming 
knowledge base. The related information is imported to 
document template, updating and expanding the knowledge 
base. To quickly and accurately generate the circuit-debug 
syllabus, rules, and process files, the relevance among 
multiple debug document libraries is utilized and the circuit­
debug information is intelligently reused. Finally, the 
generating circuit-debug documents are normatively

III. TECHNOLOGY FOR AUTOMA TICALL Y GENERATING 
DOCUMENT 
The circuit-debug document automatic generation is in 
support of heterogeneous EDA design data, in according 
with the debug document specification, making use of the 
Apriori algorithm for mining association rules, adopting 
intelligent reuse method. The specific steps of design and 
implementation are as follows. 
3.1 Automatically extract and transform heterogeneous 
EDA design data 
In electronic circuit design process, a variety of 
mainstream EDA design softwares are used, such as ProteI, 
Mentor and Power PCB. However, the design data is 
independent and closed, showing heterogeneous 
characteristics. Their file structures, data formats and 
parameter overview are different from each other, and 
"information islands" are formed. If the debug information 
can not be automatically extracted from the design file and 
be built into a uniform, complete debug document, the 
efficiency of generating document will be reduced. Therefore, 
a variety of EDA design softwares are needed to be 
preprocessed, that is, fusing the heterogeneous EDA design 
data and automatically converting to the kind of data and 
format which the system can identify and manipulate. Then 
the data for the debug process is extracted as supporting data. 
The process of fusing and extracting heterogeneous EDA 
design data is shown in Figure 2. 
First of all, according to the reading heterogeneous EDA 
design files, distinguish the file type, in detail analyzing its 
document structure and specific data format. Develop 
heterogeneous conversion interface for each software, fuse 
the various files into a uniform intermediate file format and 
integrate the heterogeneous EDA design data. Then, 
automatically obtain and share design data from the 
intermediate file, such as circuit schematics, printed circuit 
board, the simulation waveform diagram, wiring diagram, 
BOM file and other information. That is, provide the original 
reference for quickly generating various debug documents, 
in order to uniformly deal with the data during the 
preparation of various documents, and they are automatically 
saved into the debug information database.

3.2 Intelligently reuse debug iriformation 
The debug information database stores a lot of design 
data automatically extracted by EDA, including debug 
project, debug equipments, equipment composition and 
inspection methods, and so on, and the inner relation 
between these data are hidden. When users generate 
documents under the wizard assistant, the computer need 
retrieval information in the huge database, which is very 
time-consuming [5-6]. Therefore, with the mass data stored 
in the historical database, the association rules between 
different debug information are needed to dig out, and then 
intelligently reusing them. In this paper, the Apriori mining 
algorithm is used to find out the association rules between 
different debug information. 
3.2.1 Apriori algorithm 
Set collection I = {iI, i2, ... , im} , the element is called 
item. Set D as a set of transaction T (T is a collection of 
items and T ? I). Each transaction has the corresponding 
identification, such as the transaction number is denoted as 
TID. Suppose X is a collection of items in I , if X ? T, 
called transaction T including X . 
An association rule is an implication shaped 
like X ---t Y , where X ? I , Y ? I and X (l Y = 0 . 
The support of the rule X ---t Y in the transaction database 
D is the number of transactions including X and Y divide 
all transactions, denoted by sup port(X ---t Y) , 
namely sup port(X ---t Y) = IX (l YI / IDI The 
confidence of the rule X ---t Y in the transaction database 
D is the number of transactions including X and Y divide 
the number of transactions including X , denoted 
by confidence(X ---t Y) 
namely confidence(X ---t Y) = IX (l YI / IDI. Given a 
transaction set D, the association rule mining is generated the 
association rules of which the support and confidence is 
bigger than minimum support and minimum confidence 
given by user [7-8]. 
In this paper, the Apriori algorithm is used for scanning 
debug information database, querying and traversing the 
previous data, finding out the association rules between 
different debug information, storing in the knowledge base. 
Through repeatedly scans the transaction database, uses 
frequent (k -1 )-itemsets to find frequent k -itemsets, which is 
the association rules. 
3.2.2 Generate knowledge base 
There is vast debug information in the database which 
looks like irrelevant. According to the Apriori algorithm, the 
system makes correct analysis and decision on association 
between debug information, effectively discovery 
association rules and stores in the knowledge base, guide 
users to generate circuit-debug document rapidly and 
intellectually. There are about 200000 records in the debug 
information database, which means the size of transaction 
is IDI =200000 , mainly includes six candidate itemsets, the 
project name (hereinafter referred to as A), equipment 
(hereinafter referred to as B), debug device (hereinafter 
referred to as C), debug method (hereinafter referred to as D), 
test method (hereinafter referred to as E), technical index 
(hereinafter referred to as F), etc. According to the different 
items in these itemsets, find out the association rules. The 
specific steps are as follows: 
1. Looking for frequent itemsets from candidates 
According to the number of the item's records, first 
determine the maximum number of frequent itemsets, and 
then specifies the minimum support S . Set S=25% in this 
system. 
(1). Generating I-dimensional frequent itemset Ll . All 
the candidate itemsets in this system are members of the 
candidates C1, scanning the database and calculating the 
support of each item, the candidates belong to I-itemset 
frequent itemsets if it is greater than S . 
(2). Generating 2-dimensional frequent itemset L2 . 
Join: C2 = L1ooLI. By scanning the database, calculating 
V3-533 Volume 3 
2010 International Conference On Computer Design And Appliations (ICCDA 2010) 
the support of each item in C2 ' 2-dimensional frequent 
itemset L2 is determined, which is composed by the 
itemsets with minimum support in C2  
(3). Generating k-dimensional frequent itemset Lk . 
Join: CK = LK_looLK_1  By scanning the database, 
calculating the support of each item in, k-dimensional 
frequent itemset Lk is determined, which is composed by 
the itemsets with minimum support in CK . 
(4). Algorithm is not terminated until Cn = <p(n > k), 
and find out all frequent itemsets.

In table 1 ,  accordmg to rule 1, CapacItance (the Item of 
equipment) and Digital capacitance meter (the item of debug 
devices) often appear at the same time in debug information 
database. Therefore, when a user inputs "Capacitance", we 
can directly hint the user inputs "Digital capacitance meter" 
in the corresponding debug device location. According to 
rule 5, Distributed debug (the item of debug method), 
System test (the item of test method) and Bare board 
technology (the item of technical index) often appear at the 
same time in debug information database, therefore, when a 
user input "Distributed debug" and "System test", we can 
directly hint the user inputs " Bare board technology " in the 
corresponding technical index location 
The association rules found by the Apriori model will be 
automatically stored in the knowledge base. Using this 
knowledge, the system guides the users to select associated 
debug information quickly, intelligently reuse the 
independent debug information and improve the speed of 
generating circuit-debug document. 
3.2.3 Intelligently reuse information 
In this paper, through intelligently searching, regularly 
mining, adaptively expanding and updating the database, 
achieves information reused. The process of intelligently 
retrieving and reusing information is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. The process of intelligently searching and reusing information 
By mining debug information database through the 
Apriori algorithm, the system automatically store association 
rules in the knowledge base. According to the information 
V3-534 Volume 3 
2010 International Conference On Computer Design And Appliations (ICCDA 2010) 
inputted in the guide, the system dynamically executing 
intelligent retrieval, matching and extracting in the 
knowledge base. Then transfer the debug information to the 
template according to the association rules, and authentically 
reflect the data to the process of generating circuit-debug 
document. This method makes full use of association rules in 
large database, quickly generates circuit-debug file and 
maximally improves the users' input speed. If the debug 
information appears in the database the first time, it will be 
automatically stored in the database and adaptively expand 
the debug information. The system mines the debug 
information database periodically to find out the new 
association rules to update and expand the knowledge base, 
enhancing the system's intelligence and adaptability. 
3.3 Automatic generation for circuit-debug documentation 
The document template is a shared file that presents on 
the local host [9]. The process of automatic generation for a 
document is shown in Figure 4. The debug document 
template is customized relying on EDA design data, and then 
the designers and technologists query and select the 
document template in the database. The association rules 
stored in the knowledge base are imported into the template 
by the computer' auxiliary, dynamically modifY the inputted 
parts content of the document template. 
Figure 4. the automatically generating process for circuit-debug document 
According to the relationship between various documents 
in the process of debugging, the circuit-debug syllabus and 
interactive information are the basis of generating circuit­
debug rules and circuit-debug process files, all kinds of 
debug documents under the same debug project debugger 
can linkage generated. The circuit-debug syllabus are quickly 
generated in the support of the knowledge base, and be made 
into the formal one by the designers' interactive modification 
and validation. Technologists use the relevant information of 
debug syllabus library and knowledge base, combine the 
debug process requirements, and generate the circuit-debug 
rules and circuit-debug process files automatically. 
The circuit-debug document is automatically stored into 
the database after its generation, and managed normatively 
without manual intervention. Users can acquire the debug 
information through accessing the document in the database. 
Also they can edit and amend it by the simple and 
convenient word-processing environment. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For a variety of disadvantages existing in producing 
circuit-debug document, such as low automation and poor 
standardization, a model for automatically generating circuit­
debug document based on association rules is presented in 
this paper. By fusing heterogeneous EDA design files, 
design data is automatically extracted and stored in the 
debug information database, reusing the skill and experience 
of designers and technologists. The association rules among 
the debug information are mined by making use of the 
Apriori model, forming knowledge base. The circuit-debug 
information is intelligently imported into the document 
template. Various types of circuit-debug documents are 
generated automatically and quickly, utilizing the relevance 
among multiple debug document libraries. 
The system with the presented technology has been 
already applied to the practical electronic circuit design, 
which shows that the model is efficient, practical compact 
and transplantable. The automatic technology is reasonably 
used for the traditional debug process which completed 
artificially, not only optimizes the circuit-debug process, 
achieves the automaticity, inheritance and normalization for 
generating document, but also greatly improves the accuracy 
and efficiency.
