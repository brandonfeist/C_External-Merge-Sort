Abstract-This paper analyzes auto-reasoning mechanism of 
marketing strategies based on ontology and rules. The domain 
knowledge is researched for different marketing strategies and 
analytic approach. With an example of enterprise, the ontology 
is proposed and described in detail. Association rule is used to 
mining rules of strategies, and create the rules file. On that 
basis, an auto-reasoning process of marketing strategies is 
described. Because the ontology is standard, explicit and 
formalized description for shared conceptual model, the 
automation and Intelligent of enterprise marketing can be 
realized by applying semantic express, shared knowledge 
described by ontology and auto-reasoning mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In today's world economy is unstoppable trend towards 
global economic integration, enterprise survival digital, 
commercial competition, an international direction. 
Increasing degree in business today, more and more intense 
competition between companies, marketing has become the 
company's operation and management of an important part 
of more and more attention to the company manager, 
marketing battle is intensifYing. Marketing and content 
development is to improve the competitiveness of the 
enterprise market the most fundamental and most effective 
way, so variety of marketing methods, and the constant 
updates are triggered into a new pattern of marketing. 
Marketing strategy includes company's market area and 
competition advantages. Market areas refer to those trades or 
markets that company target, market areas can be grouped as 
customer type, customer requirement, company's products or 
the technologies used by the company. Competition 
advantages refer to the properties, technologies, resources 
and specific advantages owned by the company, competition 
advantage will determine a company can have good 
performance or not. 
By usage of data mining, a company can find and predict 
customer value, subdivide market, find customer interest, 
predict customer loss rate and make corresponding 
marketing strategies [11. However, because of the 
complication and dispersion of company, and the 
dependency and restriction relationship between information, 
table-based database can only express structure information 
but not semantic information, and cannot implement the 
automatic marketing strategy [2.31. 
Because the product homogenization degree is high, the 
enterprise is very difficult through the product variation to 
gain the competitive advantage, the terminal customer 
resources therefore become the focal point which various 
enterprises compete. Started from 2004, the personalized 
service market mode which based on target customer 
database is becoming the mainstream business model in 
healthy product market. To gain the most valuable customer 
becomes an important attention spot for enterprise to perform 
more effective goal marketing activity. 
II. KNOWLEDGE OF MARKETING STRATEGIES 
A. Technique and knowledge 
The ontology should include enough knowledge, so that 
the knowledge base is effective for reasoning. In a general 
way, the customer data, the commodity price and sales 
detailed are basic information. There is other information 
required for different requirement. Further more, the 
technique of analysis is different. 
For market segmentation, if using the customer's general 
population statistics characteristic (for example age, 
nationality, educational background either income and so on) 
or the purchasing behavior characteristic (for example 
purchasing volume, purchase product type structure, 
purchase frequency and so on) to divide market, the 
corresponding statistics characteristic or the purchase 
behavior characteristic should be considered when building

2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010) 
ontology. If using cluster, decision tree, neural network to 
divide market, the attribute used in data mining should be 
considered. 
Since association rule can be used in those marketing 
strategy such as hopping cart analysis based on customer 
interests, bundle sale, and gift send, customer interest 
variable and marketing strategy attribute should be included 
in knowledge description. 
For the marketing strategy in view of customer loss rate, 
it should build customer loss classification and strategy 
attribute based on customer loss rate and profit loss which 
determined by statistics method. 
Similarly, when the marketing strategy's formulation 
needs to consider the customer value, the personalized 
recommendation, the customer degree of satisfaction and so 
on question, should also contain the corresponding 
knowledge.

B. Construction of ontology 
Ontology is used to describe thing existing and the 
relations between things, describe domain knowledge by 
defining common word and concept [41. Some tools like 
Protege, OWL can be used in ontology building [5.61. 
Company D in this study is a famous company which 
product honey, the bee pollen, the propolis, the royal jelly 
from 1998. 
This company's marketing strategy is, In order to 
promote the royal jelly, present royal jelly sample to some 
customer to promote the overlapping purchase {to carry on 
association rule analysis, according to the sales combination 
which meet the rules, determine bundle-sale product}. 
The architecture of ontology class is as figure 1. Here 
only considers and the fore-mentioned marketing strategy 
related knowledge, the classes are Customer, Product, and 
Product includes subclass of Hone, Pollen, Propolis, Royal 
Jelly. 
owl:Thing 
• Customer 
T • Product 
• Honey 
• Pollen 
• Propolis 
• RoyalJelly 
Figure I. The architecture of ontology class 
Class properties include Datatype property and Object 
property. Datatype property connects the object and the data 
type value. Class Customer's Datatype property should 
include the customer basic information, like ID, name, sex, 
age and so on. Class Product's Datatype property should 
include the commodity price, as figure 2. 
.OatatypE 
• Customer _Age 
• Customer _Gender 
• Customer JD 
• Customer _Name 
• Product_Price 
Figure 2. Datatype Property 
Object property builds the connection between objects. 
Here need to consider the purchasing relations between class 
Customer and Object. Object's domain is Customer, Rang is 
Product. 
Class instance can be established after class property is 
set. For example, class Honey's instance include apple honey, 
buckwheat honey, Chinese matrimony-vine honey and so on, 
Figure 3 and figure 4 show the instance and property setting.

III. REASONING BASED ON RULES 
A. Mining Association Rule 
For target-oriented sale, we need firstly determine the 
target customer to sent present, through association rule data 
mining. 
Company D has more than 30,000 long-term customers 
and numerous fortuitous customers. This research selects 
Beijing area the customers as the sample. The corresponding 
data collection to these samples have 521 records, each 
record includes customers' basic statistics information and 
the commodity purchasing data between 11112003 and 
1130/2005, after exclude some unused data, we get 323 valid 
customer samples. 
Use Apriori algorithm to mine sample's purchasing 
history. 
Apriori algorithm is described as: 
1 Ll = {large I-item sets}; 
2 For (k = 2; Lk-1 *- 0; k++) do begin 
3 Ck =apriori_gen (Lk-1); 
4 for all transactions t D do begin 
5 Ct =subset (Ck,t) ; 
6 for all candidates c Ct do 
7 c.count++ 
8 end 
9 end 
10 Lk={C Ck Ic.counQ:minsup} 
11 end 
12 answer= kLk 
After process the total 323 sample with Apriori algorithm, 
we get the following result: 
Purchasing honey => Purchasing royal jelly, the 
supporting rate is 23%, the confidence rate is 31 %. 
Purchasing propolis => Purchasing royal jelly, the 
supporting rate is 22%, the confidence rate is 30%. 
So we conclude marketing strategy is, sent present to the 
customer who ever purchased honey or propolis. 
B. Establish Rules forReasoning 
Based on the conclusion of section , we can establish 
rules as below. 
Rl purchase(X, V), Y honey -> sample(X) 
R2 purchase(X, V), Y propolis -> sample(X) 
Jena supports to put rules in a separate rule file for 
calling, this can avoid source code change when the rules 
changes. Below is the part of marketing rule file content. 
#rule file 
@prefixLO 
<http://www.owl-promotion.comipromotion.owl> 
[First Rule :(? x rdf: type LO: perchase ?y) 
(?y rdf: type LO: Honey) -> 
(?x LO: get sample) ] 
[Secont Rule :(?x rdf: type LO: perchase ?y) 
(?y rdf: type LO: Propolis) -> 
(?x LO: get sample) ] 
Rule file is independent on application, so rule file 
support dynamic add, delete and modifY without any 
impaction to application. Also we can establish different 
rule file for different marketing strategy.

IV. AUTO-REASONING 
The data size of customer data and sales detailed is great 
and marketing strategies often changes. So the manual work 
takes time and easy to make mistakes. Auto-reasoning by 
reasoning engine can improve efficiency and reduce 
mistakes. Further more, the marketing strategies can changes 
swiftly for the storage and reuse of rule file. 
We use protege to building ontology and use Jana to 
building rules. Figure 5 shows the modularization structure 
and application framework of the auto-reasoning model. The 
auto-reasoning flow includes 4 steps. 
(I)Build knowledge base 
Build domain knowledge base based on the information 
stored in database and XML document. 
(2)Build rule file 
Perform data mining to sale records and customer data by 
statistics analysis, regression, cluster, association rule and 
neural network. 
(3) Reasoning engine generates marketing strategies. 
Reasoning engine performs automatic analysis via 
ontology and rule to draw a conclusion. 
For example, customer COOOOOI 's record shows in table 
2 as below, and: 
V8-517 
2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010) 
Apple honey Honey 
Buckwheat honey Honey 
There's rule in rule base: 
[First Rule :(?x rdf: type LO: perchase ?y) 
(?y rdf: type LO: Honey) -> 
(?x LO: get sample) ] 
Then can get the conclusion: Should sent honey 
sample to COOOOO 1. 
(4)Display strategies listing 
System displays the conclusion as sale solution to 
sales. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper merely uses association rule to establish 
marketing strategies. As we discussed in section , there are 
other data mining technique can be used. For example, we 
can compute the potential value of customers by logistics 
regression and infer key factors by decision tree or neural 
network, for the further discussing.
