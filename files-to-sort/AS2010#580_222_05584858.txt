Strengthening Fuzzy Gradual Rules
Through “all the more” Clauses
Bernadette Bouchon-Meunier, Senior Member, IEEE, Anne Laurent, Marie-Jeanne Lesot and Maria Rifqi
Abstract—Fuzzy gradual rules of the form the more X is
A, the more Y is B linguistically express information about the
correlation between attributes and their co-variation. They thus
provide valuable information summarizing the trends observed
in a given data set. In this paper, we consider strengthened
fuzzy gradual rules, i.e. gradual rules enriched with a clause
introduced by the expression “all the more”: such rules of the
form the more X is A, the more Y is B, all the more Z is C offer
additional precisions on the relation between the attributes. We
study the definition of such strengthened rules, discussing their
possible semantics, considering several interpretations of fuzzy
gradual rules. We then propose quality criteria as well as a
mining algorithm.
I. INTRODUCTION
The extraction of information describing digital data, their
inner trends and exceptional behaviors, can take many differ-
ent forms, leading to various pieces of knowledge delivered
to experts. In this paper, we focus on fuzzy gradual rules
that convey information in the form of attribute co-variations,
such as the closer the wall, the harder the brakes are applied,
or more generally the more X1 is A1, and ... and the more
Xn is An, then the more Y1 is B1, and ... and the more
Yp is Bp: such rules consider attributes (e.g. wall distance,
braking, or more generally Xi and Yi), associated to fuzzy
modalities (e.g. close, hard, or more generally Ai or Bi), and
data described by their membership degrees to these fuzzy
modalities. They then establish links between the values of
these membership degrees. Such rules were first proposed
and interpreted as a special case of inference rules [1],
[2], [3], [4], modeled by a fuzzy r-implication applied to
each data point individually. A different approach of fuzzy
gradual rules interprets them as global tendencies across the
whole data set, imposing correlations on the variations of the
membership degrees [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
In this paper, we consider, for both interpretations, en-
riched gradual rules, that add strengthening information, lin-
guistically expressed by clauses introduced by the expression
“all the more”. Such rules are of the form the closer the wall,
the harder the brakes are applied, all the more the higher
the speed: in this example, the information about the speed
enriches by an additional precision the relation established
between wall distance and braking.

We discuss the question of the semantics of this strength-
ening clause, considering the frameworks corresponding
to various interpretations of fuzzy gradual rules and the
strengthening effect in each case. We then propose several
quality criteria adapted to these different semantics. We also
present a mining algorithm to automatically extract such rules
from data sets.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 recalls the
principles of fuzzy gradual rules, discussing their interpreta-
tions and recalling their extraction methods. In Section 3,
we discuss the strengthening semantics and we detail in
Section 4 the notions of support, confidence, and other
quality criteria that can be considered in each case. Lastly in
Section 5 we describe an algorithm to automatically extract
such strengthened gradual rules.
II. FUZZY GRADUAL RULES
Several definitions and approaches exist for the notion of
fuzzy gradual rules, whose aim is to establish correlation
between attributes to summarize relevant trends observed in
the data. In this section, we first recall the classic notations
and definitions of fuzzy gradual item, itemset and rules,
as given e.g. by [6], [8]. We then compare the main two
approaches, that respectively apply rules individually to each
data point, in a fuzzy implication interpretation, or consider
the rules as co-variation constraints applied across the whole
data set, recalling the associated quality criteria.
A. Formalizations of Fuzzy Gradual Item, Itemset and Rule
A fuzzy data set D describes data through attributes
corresponding to fuzzy linguistic variables, associated to
fuzzy modalities: one can for instance have an attribute X =
speed, with the modality set {low, normal, high}. The data
are then described by membership degrees that indicate the
extent to which their characteristics belong to the considered
modalities. Table I illustrates such a data base, containing 8
data points described by 3 attributes. For instance the speed
of the first object belongs with degree 0.2 to the modality
low, 0.3 to normal and 0.5 to high.
Definition 1: Given an attribute X defined on a universe
U , a fuzzy subset A defined on U describing one of X
modalities and ? ? {<,>}, a fuzzy gradual item is defined
as the triplet (X,A, ?).
A triplet (X,A,>) is then to be understood as the more
X is A, or more precisely the higher the membership degree
of X to A; likewise, (X,A,<) is to be understood as the
less X is A, or the lower the membership degree of X to A.

For instance (wallDistance, close, >) represents the fuzzy
gradual item the closer the wall.
Definition 2: A fuzzy gradual itemset is defined as a com-
bination of several gradual items, semantically interpreted as
their conjunction
For instance M = {(X1, A1, >), (X2, A2, <)} is inter-
preted as the more X1 is A1 and the less X2 is A2.
Definition 3: A fuzzy gradual rule, denoted by M1 ? M2
is defined as a pair of fuzzy gradual itemsets M1 and M2,
on which a causality relationship is imposed; M1 is called
the antecedent, M2 the consequent.
It can for instance take the form (wallDistance, close, >)
? (braking, hard, >) meaning the closer the wall, the harder
the brakes are applied.
Different semantics can be associated to these rules. We
recall them below, distinguishing between the interpretations
as fuzzy implication and as co-variation constraints, detailing
the various approaches implementing the latter.
In the following, we do not distinguish between fuzzy sets
and their membership functions: for any fuzzy subset A and
for any data point x in the data set D, we denote A(x) the
membership degree of x to A. For an itemset containing k
items, M = {(Xj , Aj , ?j), j = 1..k}, we consider the mem-
bership degree to the itemset as M(x) = j=1..k(Aj(x))
where  denotes a a t-norm, e.g. the minimum.
B. Fuzzy Implication Interpretation
Fuzzy gradual rules were first defined as logical inference
rules, in a fuzzy logic framework [1], [2] : a fuzzy gradual
rule M1 ? M2 is considered to hold if the membership
degrees to the fuzzy modalities involved in the rule satisfy
a fuzzy implication, for each data point. Such a rule can be
interpreted as a fuzzy generalization of association rules [3],
stating that the (fuzzy) presence of M1 implies, in a logical
implication sense, the (fuzzy) presence of M2. For instance,
the rule the closer the wall, the harder the brakes are applied,
can be seen as the fuzzy extension of an association rule
relating the presence of binary attributes close wall and hard
braking.
In this interpretation, the support of the rule is then
computed as the sum of the contribution of each data point
to the implication:
Definition 4 (fuzzy implication interpretation): The sup-
port of a fuzzy gradual rule R = M1 ? M2 is computed
as
supp(M1 ? M2) =
?
x?D
i(M1(x),M2(x)) (1)
denoting i a residuated implication operator, e.g. the Goguen
implication i(a, b) = min(1, b/a) if a = 0, 1 otherwise.
It can be noticed that this support definition does not
apply to an itemset as defined in the classic association rules
framework: it applies to the rule, in an asymmetrical way
that distinguishes between M1 ? M2 and M2 ? M1, and
does not only consider the itemset M = M1 ?M2.
As an example, consider the data given in Table I and
R the rule the closer the wall, the harder the brakes are
applied that we will use throughout the paper. R support is
then 0.5+0.2+0.57+0.75+1+0.22+1+0.77 = 5.01.
It can be noticed that other implication operators lead to
different types of rules than fuzzy gradual rules: in particular,
s-implications lead to so-called certainty rules. They indeed
model certainty variations in the conclusion, leading to rules
such as the later the waking, the more certain the lateness
[2], [3].
C. Co-variation Constraint Interpretation
A second approach on fuzzy gradual rules interprets them
as co-variation constraints applied to the whole data set,
instead of considering each point individually: the rule is
understood as expressing a global tendency across the data,
as correlation on the variations of the membership degrees,
outside a logical implication framework. In the case of two
items (X,A,>) and (Y,B,>), the rule the more X is A, the
more Y is B, written (X,A,>) ? (Y,B,>), is considered
to hold if an increase in the membership degrees to A
comes along with an increase in the membership degrees
to B. Three categories of methods can be distinguished in
this context, depending on whether they rely on regression
analysis, induced ranking correlations or order compliant
data subsets, as detailed below.
1) Regression Analysis: In order to identify fuzzy gradual
rules interpreted as co-variation relationships, it was first pro-
posed to perform a regression analysis between membership
degrees [5], so as to highlight gradual dependencies.
More precisely, when considering a rule M1 ? M2, a
regression method is first applied to the membership degree
couples (M1(x),M2(x)), for all x ? D, i.e. considering all
data points simultaneously. The validity of the rule M1 ?
M2 is then evaluated from the quality of the regression:
for linear regression [5], it is thus measured by the nor-
malised mean squared error R2, together with the slope of
the regression line. Thus the attribute pairs for which the
membership degrees are insufficiently correlated are rejected,
as well as pairs for which the membership to M1 remains
almost constant while that to M2 varies (or reciprocally).
2) Induced Rankings Correlation: Whereas the regres-
sion analysis method relies on the numerical values of the
membership degrees, other works consider the co-variation
constraint only in terms of the induced order: they state that
the ordering induced by the membership degrees to M1 must
be identical to that derived from M2. In the case of itemsets
of size 1, the gradual rule the more X is A, the more Y is B
is considered to hold if ?x, x? ? D, A(x) < A(x?) implies
B(x) < B(x?). In the case of dependencies such as the more
X is A, the less Y is B, the constraint imposes that the induced
orders must be reversed.
In [6], the support of an itemset is thus measured as the
proportion of so-called concordant data couples, i.e. couples
that satisfy the constraints expressed by all gradual itemsets
involved in the rule:
Definition 5 (induced rankings correlation interpretation):
The support of an itemset M = {(Xj , Aj , ?j), j = 1..k} is
computed as
supp(M) =
|{(x, x?)/?j ? [1, k] Aj(x) ?j Aj(x
?)}|
|D|(|D| ? 1)
(2)
The support of a rule M1 ? M2 is then defined as the
support of the itemset M = M1 ? M2, as in the classic
association rule framework.
Considering the data in Table I and the rule the
closer the wall, the harder the brakes are applied,
the support is then 0.57: all couples (to simplify
the notation, we only give the object indexes)
(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6),
(6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), together with, for each of them the
exchanged couples ((2, 1), (5, 1), ...), are discordant1. Thus,
there are 24 discordant couples and 32 concordant ones for
a total number of 56, leading to the support value 32/56 =
0.57.
In [6] it is then proposed to formulate the extraction of
such rules as the discovery of association rules in a set
of transactions derived from the data set: transactions t are
built for all data couples (x, x?), items are defined as A?,
? ? {<,>}, for all modalities in D. A transaction t then
possesses an item A? if the couple (x, x?) it corresponds
to satisfies the constraint imposed by A?, i.e. A(x) ?A(x?).
Fuzzy gradual rules in D then correspond to association rules
in this modified data set. In order to reduce the computational
complexity, efficient approximation schemes are proposed
[6].
In [9] the same support definition is considered, and
interpreted in terms of ranking correlation: it is computed
as a generalised Kendall coefficient using an efficient binary
representation of the data pairs, as proposed in [8].
3) Ranking-compliant Data Subsets: In [7], [8] a different
interpretation of the co-variation constraint semantics of
fuzzy gradual rules is considered: it proposes to identify
subsets D? of the initial data set D that satisfy the ordering
constraint expressed by a given itemset, i.e. subsets of data
that can be ordered so that all couples from D? satisfy the
constraints expressed by the gradual itemsets.
Definition 6 (ranking-compliant data subset interpretation):
The support of an itemset M = {(Xj , Aj , ?j), j = 1..k} is
1When only two items are considered, it is sufficient to consider the
object pairs, because both couples (i, j) and (j, i) have the same status,
i.e. if both are concordant or both are discordant. For longer itemsets, they
must be handled separately: it can e.g. be that both (i, j) and (j, i) are
discordant, because of different gradual item constraints.
computed as
supp(M) =
1
|D|
max
D??L
|D?| (3)
where L denotes the set of all maximal data subsets D? =
{x1, ... xm} ? D for which there exists a permutation ? such
that ?j ? [1, k], ?l ? [1,m? 1], Aj(x?l) ?j Aj(x?l+1).
The maximality constraint imposes that for any D?, no object
can be added to D? without loosing the ranking compliance
property.
Considering the data in Table I and R the rule the
closer the wall, the harder the brakes are applied, L =
{{1, 3, 4, 7}, {2, 3, 4, 7}, {1, 3, 4, 8}, {2, 3, 4, 8}}: all subsets
contain 4 elements, and R support equals 4/8 = 0.5.
It can be underlined that this definition of support is
independent of the amplitude of the constraint violation: if an
object does not satisfy the itemset, i.e. if it does not fit with
the considered order, it is simply removed from D?. On the
contrary its penalisation is variable both for the regression
and the ranking correlation approaches: in the regression
approach, a point with a high deviation amplitude is likely
to distort the regression coefficient to a large extent; in the
ranking correlation approach, such a point is likely to give
rise to a high number of discordant couples (x, x?).
In [7] a heuristic is proposed to compute this support, in a
level-wise process that considers itemsets of increasing sizes.
It consists in discarding, at each level, the objects whose so-
called conflict set is maximal, i.e. the data that prevent the
maximal number of other objects to be sorted.
In [8], an exact and very efficient method is proposed,
based on precedence graphs: the data are represented through
a graph whose nodes are defined as the objects and the
edges express the precedence relationships. The graph is
represented by its adjacency matrix in a bitmap form: for
an itemset M = {(Xj , Aj , ?j), j = 1..k}, the coefficient
corresponding to (x, x?) is 1 if ?j ? [1, k] Aj(x) ?j Aj(x?),
0 otherwise. The support of the considered itemset can then
be obtained as the length of the maximal path in the graph.
The support defined in Equation (2) can be obtained as the
sum of the elements in this matrix, as proposed in [9].
The relevance of this approach comes from its very high
efficiency to generate gradual itemsets of size k + 1 from
itemsets of size k: indeed it holds that if M is an itemset
generated using M ? and M ??, its adjacency matrix AdjM =
AdjM ?&AdjM ?? where & is the bitwise AND operation.
III. STRENGTHENING EFFECT
THROUGH “ALL THE MORE” CLAUSES
The semantics of fuzzy gradual rules have been widely
studied, and several interpretations have been proposed, as
recalled in the previous section. In this section, we consider
strengthened fuzzy gradual rules, i.e. fuzzy gradual rules
enriched by an additional reinforcement clause introduced by
the linguistic expression “all the more”. Such strengthened
fuzzy gradual rules can be illustrated by the example the
closer the wall, the harder the brakes are applied, all the
more the higher the speed and formalized as follows:
Definition 7: A strengthened gradual rule is a triplet of
fuzzy gradual itemsets (M1,M2,M3) and is denoted by
M1 ? M2;M3. M1 is the antecedent, M2 the conclusion,
and M3 the strengthening clause, linguistically introduced by
the expression all the more.
In the following we discuss the semantics that can be
attached to this strengthening effect, comparing various inter-
pretations, in particular with respect to the different seman-
tics of fuzzy gradual rules. We focus on the interpretation
as co-variation constraints across the whole data, recalled in
Section II-C, and in particular on the ranking compliant data
subset approach (see Section II-C.3 and Definition 6) that
identifies data subsets on which the ranking constraint holds.
In Section III-D we discuss the strengthening effect for the
fuzzy implication interpretation of fuzzy gradual rules.
A. Difference with Conjunctive Gradual Rules
It is first important to underline the difference between
strengthened rules and conjunctive rules of the form
(M1?M3) ? M2. With the considered illustrative example,
this rule would be the closer the wall and the higher the
speed, the harder the brakes are applied. Both rules can hold
for a given data set, still, their semantics differ.
Indeed, for such conjunctive gradual rules, M3 plays a
causal role on M2 and in the co-variation interpretation of
fuzzy gradual rules, it imposes a strong constraint: it requires
that the rankings induced by the three itemsets M1, M2 and
M3 are identical or highly consistent.
In the strengthening case, the ranking constraint only
concerns the two itemsets M1 and M2. This restricts to a
lesser extent the number of objects on which the rule applies:
the reinforcement effect rather applies on the rule M1 ? M2
than on M2, even if it does not exclude a causal effect of
M3 on M2.
B. Constraint on Variation Strength
One interpretation of the strengthening effect considers it
as a constraint on the variation intensity of M2, when the
rankings according to M1 and M2 agree: the relation “all
the more” is understood as a intensification of the variations
of the attributes involved in M2 according to M3 values.
Considering the illustrative example the closer the wall,
the harder the brakes are applied, all the more the higher
the speed, this interpretation means that first an increase in
the wall closeness implies an increase in the braking strength,
and second that the increase is correlated to high speed.
Formally, this interpretation of strengthening can be ex-
pressed as the conjunction of fuzzy gradual rules: a rule
M1 ? M2, and a rule of the form M3 ? ?M2 where
?M2 denotes M2 variations.
C. Reinforced Presence
Another interpretation evaluates the strengthening influ-
ence of M3 on the rule M1 ? M2 as the fact that the rule is
better satisfied when the candidate objects are the ones pos-
sessing M3 rather than when the whole data set is considered:
it should be easier to apply the rule when one focuses on data
possessing M3. Equivalently, the strengthening influence of
M3 on the rule M1 ? M2 is interpreted through the extent
to which M3 is possessed by objects satisfying the rule.
The reinforcement is thus used to partition the data (con-
sidering a fuzzy partition) and to compare the rule validity
on a data subset and the whole data set: this interpretation
combines the fuzzy gradual rule with a (fuzzy) presence
condition.
For this interpretation, the fuzzy gradual rule approach
through ranking compliant data subsets is in particular rele-
vant: it is indeed easy to measure a reinforced presence of M3
when the rule M1 ? M2 applies, as the method explicitly
extracts data subsets for which the rule holds. Therefore we
will use this method in the following, in particular to define
the quality criteria.
Still, the other ranking-based approaches of fuzzy gradual
rules also make it possible to take into account a weighted
influence of M3 presence: in the regression case, it is possible
to modify the R coefficient, e.g. to give less weights to
regression errors that coincide with low presence of M3. In
the ranking correlation approach, the penalisation associated
to a discordant pair can also depend on the membership
degrees to M3.
D. Case of Fuzzy Implication Interpretation
In the framework of fuzzy gradual rules understood as
fuzzy implications satisfied individually for each data point,
a strengthened rule M1 ? M2;M3 can be interpreted fol-
lowing different lines. Indeed, in a such framework, it makes
sense to consider an additional attribute in the data base,
whose values are the truth values of the implication M1 ?
M2, i.e. i(M1(x),M2(x)) for all x ? D. The strengthened
rule can then be understood as gradual relation between the
membership degree to M3 and the new additional attribute,
meaning that the reinforcement holds if the implication is all
the truer as M3 is true.
The strengthened rule is then identical to the cascaded
fuzzy gradual rule M3 ? (M1 ? M2) in the fuzzy
implication interpretation of gradual rules. The support of
such a rule can then be computed by transposing Equation (1)
as
?
x?D i(M3(x), i(M1(x),M2(x)).
It can be underlined that for s-implications, the cascaded
rule is equivalent to (M1 ? M3) ? M2 as the previ-
ous quantity equals i((M3(x),M1(x)),M2(x)). Now the
?ukasiewicz implication, i(a, b) = min(1 ? a + b, 1), is
both an r- and an s-implication, combining the gradual rule
interpretation with the previous property. It thus bridges the
gap between reinforced and conjunctive rules.
Besides, this interpretation sheds new light on the inter-
pretation presented in the previous subsection III-C, although
the latter does not belong to the logical framework: it also
considers a fuzzy presence semantics. Still, the presence of
M3 is not taken into account individually for each data point,
but it is evaluated globally on the ranking compliant data
subset.
IV. STRENGTHENING QUALITY CRITERIA
In this section, we describe the quality measures, and
in particular support and confidence, proposed to assess
strengthened fuzzy gradual rules according to the semantics
described in Section III-C. As mentioned previously, the
ranking compliant data subset recalled in Section II-C.3
appears to be particularly relevant for this interpretation.
Therefore we exploit its properties in the proposed quality
criteria, especially the identification of subsets of data on
which the ranking constraint holds.
A strengthened rule M1 ? M2;M3 contains two com-
ponents, namely the fuzzy gradual rule M1 ? M2, and
its reinforcement, thus it must be assessed according to
these two elements. Therefore, we propose to characterize
a reinforcement rule both by the support and confidence
of the rule M1 ? M2, and by the strengthened support
and confidence in reinforcement, that measure the quality of
the latter. In the following, we propose definitions for these
criteria.
A. Strengthened Support
As in the classic case, we propose to define the support of
a strengthened rule by an evaluation of its frequency. To that
aim, we use a sigma-count approach, to define the degree
to which M3 is present among the objects that satisfy the
rule M1 ? M2: the higher it is, the better the reinforcement
holds.
1) Definition: More formally, we propose the following
definition
Definition 8: The strengthened support of a fuzzy gradual
rule R = M1 ? M2;M3 is defined as
s supp(R) = max
i=1..k
?
x?D?
i
M3(x) (4)
denoting L = {D?i , i = 1..p} the set of all maximal data
subsets that can be permuted to satisfy the ranking constraints
on M1 and M2.
Introducing the notation M3(D?) =
?
x?D? M3(x), i.e.
the fuzzy cardinal of D? according to M3, the support equals
s supp(R) = maxi=1..p M3(D
?
i ).
2) Example: Considering the data given in Table I and
the R rule the closer the wall, the harder the brakes are
applied, all the more the higher the speed, one has L =
{{1, 3, 4, 7}, {2, 3, 4, 7}, {1, 3, 4, 8}, {2, 3, 4, 8}}, and
M3(D
?
1) = M3({1, 3, 4, 7}) = 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.4 = 2.6,
M3(D
?
2
) = M3({2, 3, 4, 7}) = 0.6 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.4 = 2.7,
M3(D
?
3
) = M3({1, 3, 4, 8}) = 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.7 = 2.9,
and M3(D?4) = M3({2, 3, 4, 8}) = 0.6+0.9+0.8+0.7 = 3.
Thus the strengthened support is 3.
3) Properties: It must be underlined that the proposed
definition is not symmetric, due to the specific role of M3.
Besides, as discussed in previous section, this definition
does not take into account a co-variation of the membership
degrees to the strengthening clause M3 with those of the
antecedent and consequent of the rule: it uses a sigma-count
on M3 presence. This approach is in particular relevant to
handle reinforcement by binary attributes, as for instance
the greater the meat purchase, the averager the vegetable
purchase, all the more if the city is Paris. Such rules can
easily be dealt with in this context: the membership degrees
equal 1 for all objects possessing the attribute.
One can replace in the previous definition the sigma-count
by a thresholded sigma-count, using a user-defined threshold:
this makes it possible to avoid taking into account objects that
are not representative enough of M3.
Lastly, as the support defined for classic association rules,
the following property holds:
Property 1: The strengthened support is anti-monotone
with respect to the size of the M3 itemset.
Proof: if one considers two rules R1 = M1 ? M2;M3
and R2 = M1 ? M2;M4 with M3 ? M4, it holds that
s supp(R1) ? s supp(R2). Indeed, the two rules R1 and
R2 have the same basic form, and thus, the same set L of
maximal ranking compliant data subsets. Moreover, for any
x ? D, M3(x) ? M4(x). Indeed itemsets are interpreted as
conjunction of the items they contain. Thus, noting M the
itemset such that M = M4\M3, M4 = M3 ? M , and ?x
M4(x) = (M3(x),M(x)) ? M3(x). Thus it holds that
?D?i ? D, M4(D
?
i ) ? M3(D
?
i ), which leads to the desired
result.
This property will in particular be used for the mining
algorithm described in Section V
B. Strengthened Confidence
The confidence in the strengthened fuzzy gradual rule
then measures the relevance of the strengthening effect as
compared to the non strengthened rule M1 ? M2.
1) Definition: Following the classic scheme of confidence,
defined as the quotient between the rule support by the an-
tecedent support, a first definition could consist in comparing
the strengthened support, as defined in Equation (4), to the
support of the non strengthened rule: this would lead to
define s conf(R) = s supp(M1 ? M2;M3)/supp(M1 ?
M2) = maxi=1..p M3(D
?
i )/maxi=1..p |D
?
i |.
Now this definition is not satisfactory, because it compares
values that may be obtained from different data subsets: the
numerator is obtained from the ranking compliant subset
with maximalM3 fuzzy cardinality, whereas the denominator
comes from the ranking compliant subset with maximal
cardinality. Now these subsets need not be the same, and
the quotient of two values corresponding to different objects
does not have an intuitive meaning.
Therefore, we propose to compute the quotient between
M3 fuzzy cardinality and cardinality for each candidate data
subset individually, and to then take the maximal value:
Definition 9: The strengthened confidence of a fuzzy
gradual rule R = M1 ? M2;M3 is defined as
s conf(R) = max
i=1..p
M3(D
?
i )
|D?i |
(5)
denoting L = {D?i , i = 1..p} the set of all maximal data
subsets that can be permuted to satisfy the ranking constraints
on M1 and M2.
This strengthened confidence implements the semantics
proposed in Section III-C evaluating the average membership
degree to M3 among data satisfying the ranking constraint.
Several data subsets satisfying the condition, we consider
the maximal obtained value. This choice implies that we
consider that the confidence can be established from any data
subset on which the strengthened rule can rely and that it is
sufficient that there exists one such subset.
In the previous example that considers the rule the closer
the wall, the harder the brakes are applied, all the more
the higher the speed, all maximal subsets D?i have the same
cardinality, 4, the strengthened confidence equals 3/4 = 0.75
2) Properties: It can be noted that, as the strengthened
support, and contrary to the classic confidence measure, the
following property holds:
Property 2: The strengthened confidence is anti-monotone
with respect to the size of the M3 itemset.
Proof: denoting as previously R1 = M1 ? M2;M3
et R2 = M1 ? M2;M4 with M3 ? M4, it holds that
M4(D
?
i ) ? M3(D
?
i ) as previously. Dividing both sides by
|D?i |, and taking the maximum over i, this leads to the anti-
monotony property.
This allows to directly extract strengthened fuzzy grad-
ual rules with high confidence that satisfy a user defined
threshold, instead of having to filter out the rules with low
confidence after they have been extracted: it makes it possible
to efficiently mine strengthened rules of interest.
C. Other Quality Criteria
Other classic quality criteria for association rule evaluation
(see e.g. [10]) can also be extended, and in particular the
lift measure [11]: the strengthened support and confidence
measures are sensitive to the frequency of the M3 itemset
(in the same manner as classic support and confidence are
sensitive to the frequency of the conclusion itemset), whereas
the lift criterion is not. In particular, the lift criterion makes
it possible to reject candidate association rules that conclude
to modalities present in all data. Likewise, the aim of the
strengthened lift is to reject reinforcement clauses based on
modalities such that ?x, M3(x) = 1.
Definition 10: The strengthened lift of a fuzzy gradual
rule R = M1 ? M2;M3 is defined as
s lift = max
i=1..p
M3(D
?
i )
|D?i |
×
|D|
M3(D)
(6)
denoting L = {D?i , i = 1..p} the set of all maximal data
subsets that can be permuted to satisfy the ranking constraints
on M1 and M2.
It compares the average membership degree to M3 among
data satisfying the ranking constraint to the global average
membership degree to M3 across the whole data set.
V. ALGORITHM TO MINE STRENGTHENED FUZZY RULES
The problem is then to extract all strengthened fuzzy
gradual rules whose support, confidence, strengthened sup-
port and strengthened confidence are larger than user-defined
thresholds. The rules looked for are maximal rules, i.e. those
that contain the highest possible number of fuzzy gradual
items while satisfying the thresholds. This maximality con-
straint applies to all three itemsets constituting antecedent,
consequent and strengthening clause.
A strengthened fuzzy gradual rule M1 ? M2;M3 contains
two components, the fuzzy gradual rule M1 ? M2 and
the strengthened clause M3 that must satisfy the support
and confidence constraints independently. Thus the mining
algorithm is made of two steps: the first one consists in
identifying the fuzzy gradual rules that satisfy the support
and confidence constraints, the second aims at establishing
the strengthened itemsets that can reinforce these rules.
The first step can be performed using the GRITE algorithm
[8] that extracts all frequent fuzzy gradual itemsets with their
support. Moreover, it identifies data subsets that can be sorted
so as to satisfy the ranking constraints expressed by these
itemsets.
It can be noted that the definition of strengthened support
and confidence (Equations (4) and (5)) actually depend
on the frequent itemsets M1 ? M2 and not on the rules
M1 ? M2. Thus they do not require the identification of
the causality relations between the items constituting the
extracted itemsets.
The second step that aims at establishing the strengthening
itemsets for the previous itemsets follows the principles of
the APRIORI algorithm, using the strengthened support and
confidence as quality measure: strengthened itemsets are
extracted in a level-wise approach, progressively building
the itemsets of increasing size, exploiting the anti-monotony
properties of these criteria.
To that aim, given a fuzzy gradual rule R to strengthen (or
a frequent fuzzy gradual itemset), the candidate strengthening
itemsets of size k + 1 are generated from the candidates
of size k, using the classic APRIORIgen process. They are
then assessed using strengthened support and confidence,
defined in Equations (4) and (5). The candidates for which
one of these values is below the user-defined thresholds
are discarded. These two steps are iterated until no more
candidate can be generated.
During the initialisation phase, the candidate strengthening
itemsets containing single items are defined as modalities of
attributes that do not appear in the itemsets to strengthen. In-
deed, rules involving several modalities of a given attributes
with different status (antecedent, conclusion, reinforcement)
could only contain trivial information, regarding mutual
exclusion of modalities for instance, and would not be of
interest.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper we proposed a new approach to strengthen
fuzzy gradual rules, reinforced using “all the more” clauses,
to extract more information summarizing data sets. We
studied the semantics of such rules, proposed criteria to
measure the relevance of such rules and described a candidate
level-wise extraction algorithm.
Beside the application of this algorithm to several data sets
in order to empirically evaluate the identified knowledge,
future works aim at extending the strengthening semantics
to other types of fuzzy graduality, in particular expressed by
certainty rules. More generally, extensions to other types of
rules, such as association rules or non fuzzy gradual rules
are to be examined. They would provide a way to extract
contextual information, i.e. rules that do not aply to the whole
data but only to data subsets.
