Abstract- In this paper, a software toolkit has been developed 
for in silica prediction of the differentiation destiny of 
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) in vitro. The software toolkit 
was developed in CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production 
System) as an expert system, with a java-based GUI. This 
toolkit utilizes the rules obtained from previous experimental 
data via data mining techniques, based on which the prediction 
is to be made. Thus, the prediction accuracy can be affected by 
the amount and quality of the rules, which can be improved by 
both manual adjustment and expansion of the MSC 
differentiation database in future. 
Keywords- mesenchymal stem cell, cell differentiation, 
CLIPS, data mining, rule based. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are important to tissue 
engineering and stem cell therapy due to their pluripotent 
differentiation potentials both in vivo and in vitro [I], and 
have become one of the most studied stem cells in the last 
century. The pluripotency of MSCs includes osteogenesis, 
chondrogenesis, adipogenesis, myogenesis, tendogenesis, 
and neurogenesis, besides trans-differentiation [2]. Other 
discoveries regarding plasticity and immunologic properties 
of MSC have further increased the interest in their clinical 
applications [3]. The significance of the application of MSCs 
in clinical therapy has triggered an urgent need for the 
prediction of MSC differentiation. 
A large number of studies have been carried out with the 
aim of understanding and predicting MSC differentiation [4]. 
However, different experiments have adopted different 
culture conditions under which MSCs grow and differentiate. 
Those culture conditions include donor species, culture 
medium, supplement and growth factor, culture dimension 
(monolayer vs. 3D culture), substrate (for monolayer culture) 
vs. scaffold (for 3D culture), etc [5]. They resulted in a large 
yet scattered spectrum of MSC differentiation scenarios and 
the discrete nature of available data structure for MSCs, 
which motivates our previous research [6] where those MSC 
data were analyzed by the Classification Association Rule 
Mining (CARM) approach [7], with the help of an online 
database containing essential experimental data regarding 
MSC differentiation scenarios [8]. In our latest study [9], a 
CARM algorithm called CMAR (Classification based on 
Multiple Association Rules) [10] has been successfully used 
to obtain rules with useful information on MSC 
differentiation. 
In this study, we aim at utilizing the rules obtained from 
CMAR (referred as "CMAR rules" below) for prediction on 
MSC differentiation in silica. For this purpose, a rule-based 
and object-oriented programming tool called CLIPS (C 
Language Integrated Production System) [11] has been 
selected to be the coding environment. After the integration 
of previously obtained CARM rules into the CLIPS routine, 
together with a java-based GUI, a software toolkit for 
computational prediction on MSC differentiation has been 
produced as its first version. 
II. PROGRAMMING BACKGROUND: CLIPS, EXPERT 
SYSTEMS AND RULE-BASED PROGRAMMING 
CLIPS is a programming tool which provides a complete 
environment for the construction of rule and/or object based 
expert systems [12]. CLIPS was created in 1985, and has 
now been widely used throughout the government, industry, 
and academia for its advantages in knowledge representation, 
portability, extensibility, verification/validation, etc [11]. 
Unlike traditional programming languages, such as 
FORTRAN and C that are designed and optimized for the 
procedural operation of data or digits, CLIPS allows the 
modeling of information at higher levels of abstraction, 
which simulates the way by which humans solve complex 
problems. As a product of the development of artificial 
intelligence, CLIPS allows programs to be built in a way that 
they closely resemble human logic in their implementation 
and are therefore easier to be developed and maintained [12]. 
"These programs, which emulate human expertise in well 
defined problem domains, are called expert systems" [13].

2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010) 
Rule-based programming is one of the most commonly 
used techniques for developing expert systems. In this 
programming paradigm, rules are used to represent heuristics, 
which specifY actions to be executed for a set of given 
conditions [13]. A rule consists of an "IF portion" which is a 
series of patterns specifYing the conditions (often referred as 
"facts") which make the rule applicable, and a "THEN 
portion" specifYing actions to be performed once the rule 
becomes applicable. The process of matching "facts" to 
patterns is called pattern matching. The expert system tool 
provides a mechanism which automatically matches "facts" 
against patterns and determines which rules are applicable. 
Pattern matching always occurs whenever changes are made 
to "facts", thus the actions of applicable rules can be 
dynamically updated on the execution list, and executed 
when being instructed to. 
In this study, the heuristics that the rules in CLIPS 
represent is the CMAR rules derived from data mining 
techniques in our previous study [9]. As CMAR was applied 
to the data in the online database, hundreds of CMAR rules 
were obtained and analyzed. These rules were then filtered 
according to our pre-knowledge in lab, with the portion that 
we found not to have scientific sense abandoned. The 
remaining rules were implemented into CLIPS routine after 
being transformed according to the CLIPS syntax, as 
elucidated below. 
III. PRODUCTION OF THE Msc DIFFERENTIATION 
PREDICTION TOOLKIT. 
A. Outline of the Toolkit 
The MSC differentiation prediction toolkit was built on 
the modification of a CLIPS sample program "WineDemo", 
as a demo in the CLIPSJNI (CLIPS with Java Native 
Interface) package vo.i for CLIPS v6.3. The toolkit consists 
of two pieces of sub-routine: 1) a CLIPS routine containing 
the integrated CMAR rules based on which predictions can 
be made and 2) a java routine constructing the QUI for the 
toolkit, a snapshot of which is shown in Fig. 1. The current 
version of the toolkit is vl.0, which can be freely 
downloaded2•

B. GUI of the Toolkit 
As shown in Fig. 1, the QUI consists of three major 
components: single choice panel, multi choice panel and 
result panel. The single choice panel contains four 
parameters which have been claimed to be essential 
information on MSC: donor species of MSC, culture 
medium to MSC, culture dimension and substrate/scaffold 
on which MSCs grow. In the current version (vl.O), options 
for the values of these parameters in the single panel were 
listed in Table 1. The multi choice panel contains 23 types of 
chemical reagents as supplements to culture medium, 
including FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum)/FCS (Fetal Calf Serum), 
dexamethasone, insulin, ascorbic acid, etc. The result panel 
is the place where predictions are shown, together with their 
respect Suggestion Rate (SR). Users should be reminded that 
predictions given by this toolkit can be more than one, each 
having a suggestion rate as its complement. The predictions 
shown in the result panel of the QUI were referred as "DPs" 
(Deliberate Predictions) below, with an intention to differ 
from "CPs" (Candidate Predictions), as elucidated below. 
C. Integration ofCMAR rules into the CLIPS routine 
As indicated above, the toolkit was developed as an 
expert system for the human expertise embedded in the 
CLIPS routine, which is a selected portion of the 295 CMAR 
rules obtained from our previous study [9]. The CMAR rules 
were derived from the online MSC database3, as partially 
listed in Table 2. 
According to our pre-knowledge in lab, most of the 
CMAR rules contain useful information on MSC 
differentiation, and were regarded as validated rules in this 
study. However, some rules does not have scientific sense, 
thus should be abandoned before integrated into the CLIPS 
routine. For example, Rule #294: {human} -> {proliferation} 
[58.04%] says that human MSCs do not differentiate, which 
is not scientifically sensible according to our pre-knowledge 
because the lineage to which MSCs committed should be 
predominantly directed by culture medium and supplements,

not contain information on culture medium or supplement, 
such as Rule #294, were filtered out and abandoned. 283 
rules remained after the filtration and were integrated into 
the CLIPS routine according to the CLIPS syntax to act as 
the heuristics in expert system. After the integration, the 
antecedent of a CMAR rule which represents culture 
conditions of MSCs becomes the "IF portion" of the 
corresponding CLIPS rule, and the class of the CMAR rule, 
i.e., the prediction to the MSC differentiation fate based on 
this specific CMAR rule, becomes the "THEN portion". 
In this study, the CLIPS routine contains 283 CLIPS 
rules, which are the respect 283 CMAR rules. These CMAR 
rules represent a sub-portion of the MSC differentiation 
pattern in reality, as they were derived from the current MSC 
database which contains the experimental data. On the other 
hand, user-manipulated rules can always be added into the 
CLIPS routine to interfere the prediction, whereas in the 
current stage we only use these CMAR rules. 
D. Working Mechanism of the Toolkit 
The working mechanism of the toolkit was shown in 
Fig.2. The Toolkit needs the support of CLIPSJNI package 
to get started. Once started, the QUI of the toolkit will appear 
and simultaneously start the CLIPS routine in the 
background. The QUI is implemented with a real-time 
listener so that any update of the user input (e.g., selection/ 
un-selection of a checkbox) will be immediately noticed and 
transferred to the CLIPS routine. The CLIPS routine will not

Figure 2. The working mechanism of the toolkit 
take action until receiving the updated input from the QUI. 
Once an input update is received, the CLIPS routine initiates 
the pattern matching mechanism of CLIPS, during which the 
received input from the QUI is treated as a "fact". If no rule 
is matched after the pattern matching, the CLIPS routine 
remains idle; otherwise all the matched rules become 
applicable, followed by their actions executed, which is to 
make their respect predictions. These predictions are then 
checked one by one for their confidence values and anyone 
with a confidence value lower than a given threshold is 
filtered out. The remaining predictions are transferred to the 
QUI as candidate predictions (CPs). Hence, the threshold is 
named "CP threshold". In the current version, the CP 
threshold was set to be 25% as a sample value, which can be 
changed according to the necessity in future. DPs, which are 
to be shown on the QUI result panel, are then generated out 
of all the CPs, with their respect suggestion rates calculated 
by the underlying java routine of the QUI (details for the 
calculation were elucidated below). In the last step, the DPs 
with their respect suggestion rates are updated to the QUI as 
the prediction results of the toolkit. 
E. Calculation of the Suggestion Rate 
The calculation of suggestion rates of DPs is based on 
confidence values of CPs. Readers are reminded that DPs 
made by the toolkit can be more than one, each with its 
corresponding suggestion rate. The reason for the generation 
of muli-DPs as the prediction results is that, in reality, 
chemical agents may induce MSCs to differentiate along one 
lineage while inhibiting them against others, the interplay of 
which makes it difficult to guarantee the differentiation fate 
of MSCs in the end. Thus, it is reluctant to stick on only one 
DP without taking account of other possibilities. As a 
consequence, an alternative way is adopted in this study, 
which is to include all the possible differentiation fates of 
MSCs as multi-DPs. 
The generation of DPs is dependent on the composition 
of CPs. In this study, CPs derived from applicable rules in 
the CLIPS routine can cover up to four categories due to the 
four classes covered by the 283 CMAR rules, which are 
"osteogenesis", "chondrogenesis", "adipogenesis" and 
"proliferation without differentiation", respectively. Thus, 
V2-408 
2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010) 
CPs from different rules may differ from each other, with 
some of them overlapped meanwhile. As a consequence, two 
possible scenarios for the composition of CPs can be 
summarized as follows: 
• Scenario I ? homogeneous CPs 
In this scenario, CPs consist of one same category (e.g., 
"osteogenesis"), yet their confidence values can be different. 
As a result, only one DP will be generated, which is same to 
the CPs. For example, if all CPs suggest "osteogenesis", the 
only DP is also "osteogenesis", with its suggestion rate (SRo) 
calculated as follows: 
SRo = MAX(CoJ (1) 
where COj is the confidence value of each CP suggesting 
"osteogenesis". 
The Eq. (1) is 
"osteogenesis", SRc 
"adipogenesis" and 
differentiation"). 
applicable to all DPs (SRo for 
for "chondrogenesis", SRa for 
SRp for "proliferation without 
• Scenario 2 ? heterogeneous CPs 
In this scenario, CPs consist of more than one category. 
In this scenario, all the CPs suggesting "proliferation without 
differentiation" will be ignored when generating DPs. The 
reason is that if MSCs can be induced into any types of 
differentiation, the "proliferation without differentiation" 
must be a false prediction. Consequently, the calculation for 
suggestion rates in this scenario only applies to the other 
three categories of predictions (i.e., "osteogenesis", 
"chondrogenesis" and "adipogenesis"). As an example, 
suppose the CPs consist of all the three categories 
"osteogenesis", "chondrogenesis" and "adipogenesis", in the 
current version (v 1.0) of the toolkit, the formula for 
calculation of suggestion rate for "osteogenesis" (SRo) is set 
to be: 
LCo, (2) SRo = MAX(Co,). " " " L.., Co, + L.., Cel + L.., Ca, 
where Coj, CCj, Cak is the confidence value of each 
individual CP suggesting "osteogenesis", "chondrogenesis" 
and "adipogenesis", respectively. 
In Eq. (2), if either L Cc j = 0 or L Cak = 0, then the 
equation implies the situation where only two categories are 
covered by all CPs. Similarly, if L: Cc j = 0 and L Cak = 0, 
then Eq. (2) becomes Eq. (I), which implies the scenario 1. 
Eq. (2) is applicable to the DPs of "chondrogenesis" and 
"adipogenesis", but not "proliferation without 
differentiation" . 
F. Summarization 
In this section, the production of the MSC differentiation 
prediction toolkit has been described. A CLIPS sample 
program "WineDemo" was chosen to be the antetype for the 
toolkit, with its OUI reconstructed. 283 CMAR rules were 
integrated into the CLIPS routine after being filtered 
according to our pre-knowledge on MSC differentiation. 
Users are reminded that all the CMAR rules utilized in the 
current version of toolkit were derived from experimental 
data in vitro, thus the DPs made by the toolkits are for MSC 
differentiation in vitro only. The calculation of suggestion 
rate to DPs was designed and implemented into the java 
routine, which dominates the working mechanism of the 
toolkit. After the toolkit was built, tests have been made to 
examine its performance, the results of which were 
elucidated in the next section. 
IV. TESTS FOR THE TOOLKIT AND RESULTS 
The MSC differentiation prediction toolkit can be run on 
most operation systems with the support from the CLlPSJNI 
package (included with the toolkit), and users have to install 
java on their computers before running the program. To run 
the programme, go to the directory of "Toolkits\ 
MSCDiff Toolkit" in the downloaded package. Windows 
XP users can simply click "run.bat" file in this directory, or 
type the following command in the "Command Prompt" 
application (select Start > All Programs > Accessories > 
Command Prompt): 
java -cp .; . .I . .ICLlPSJNI.jar -Djava.library.path= . .I .. MSCDiff 
For Mac OS X users, type the following command in the 
"Terminal" application (located in the Applications/Utilities 
directory) 
java -cp .: . .I . .ICLIPSJNI.jar -Djava.library.path= . .I .. MSCDiff 
For users of other operation systems, please refer to 
" instructions.pdf' for instructions. 
After the toolkit has been started, tests were executed to 
examine its performance. All tests were performed on 
Microsoft Windows XP Professional (Service Pack 2), with 
CLIPS (Quicksilver Beta) and java 1.6.0 installed. One test 
was chosen to be an example, the result of which was shown 
in Fig. I. In this test, several culture conditions were selected 
for the prediction to human MSC differentiation in 
monolayer culture. These culture conditions included culture 
medium of DMEM, substrate of TCP and several randomly 
chosen growth factors as supplements to the culture medium. 
The DPs given by the toolkit included chondrogenesis, 
osteogenesis and adipogenesis, with a descending order in 
terms of their suggestion rates. To check the causes to the 
DPs (i.e., the applicable rules and the consequent CPs), we 
embedded a debugging switch in the java routine. After the 
switch was turned on, it was found that 35 rules suggesting 
"osteogenesis", 48 rules suggesting "chondrogenesis", 6 
rules suggesting "adipogenesis" and 2 rules suggesting 
"proliferation without differentiation" became applicable, out 
of the 283 rules in total. However, as elucidated in the 
working mechanism of the toolkit, the DPs in this test did not 
include "proliferation without differentiation". The respect 
suggestion rates for the three DPs were calculated according 
to Eq. (2). 
A. Design of Eq. (2) 
V. DISCUSSIONS 
The calculation of suggestion rates is done using Eq. (2). 
Although we are aware that Eq. (2) has limitations, it is 
extremely difficult or even impossible to design a perfect 
equation. It was decided that a "weight factor" for each DP 
ought to be calculated in terms of: I) the number of its 
supporting rules; and 2) the confidence value of each 
supporting rule. In the current version of the toolkit the 
V2-409 
2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010) 
"weight factor" is affected by the sum of confidence values 
of the rules supporting the corresponding DP and the sum of 
confidence values of all applicable rules. 
B. The CP Threshold 
As mentioned in Section III 0, a CP threshold was set in 
the CLIPS routine as a part of its working mechanism. In this 
study, the threshold value is set to be 25%. The reason is that 
there only 4 differentiation destinies were taken into account, 
which are osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, adipogenesis and 
proliferation without differentiation; thus, any rule with a 
confidence value lower than 25% is regarded to be 
incompetent in a sense that it performs no better than a 
random guess, hence it is eligible to contribute to CPs. 
However, because each of the 283 CMAR rules has a 
confidence value higher than 50%, the threshold value of 
25% in this study is just to show an example, which can be 
changed in future according to the need. 
C. Evaluation of the Toolkit 
As the DPs with their suggestion rates are generated 
according to the 283 CMAR rules, the accuracy of each DP 
is affected by the accuracy of each CMAR rule that supports 
it. Unfortunately, due to the mechanism of Weighted Chi 
Squared (WCS) [14] adopted by the CMAR algorithm, the 
accuracy of an individual CMAR rule is not retrievable. 
However, as reported in [9], the average accuracy of all the 
295 CMAR rules (including the abandoned 13 rules) is 
90.4%, which is satisfactory. Another factor affecting the DP 
accuracy is the size of the online database from which the 
CMAR rules were abstracted. The current database has 501 
records and will be constantly expanded. With the expansion 
of the database, more CMAR rules are expected to be 
explored, with an intension to improve the accuracy of DPs. 
Additionally, DPs made by the current version of the toolkit 
do not involve consideration of the doze of the chemical 
reagents that are supplemented to the culture medium, 
because the CMAR rules do not have the regarding 
information. This is due to the fact that the current available 
data on MSCs are extremely limited. Neither the 
involvement of different chemicals in the intracellular 
pathways related to MSC differentiation nor the sensibility of 
the doze of chemicals to those pathways is clearly known in 
the current stage. Thus, DPs given by the current version of 
the toolkit should be regarded as an intuitive suggestion 
rather than a rigorous diagnose. With the development of 
human's knowledge on MSC differentiation and the 
consequent expansion of the database, information on the 
doze of chemicals is expected to be taken into account in 
future versions of the toolkit. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, a software toolkit for prediction of MSC 
differentiation was developed on the antetype of a CLIPSJNI 
sample program. This toolkit utilizes 283 integrated CMAR 
rules obtained from our previous study to make predictions 
on user-given conditions. The performance of the toolkit, as 
its first version, was tested and showed a satisfactory 
function in terms of guidance to MSC culture. With the 
framework of the toolkit settled, its power depends on the 
amount and quality of the integrated rules, which can be 
improved by both manual adjustment and expansion of the 
MSC differentiation database in future.
