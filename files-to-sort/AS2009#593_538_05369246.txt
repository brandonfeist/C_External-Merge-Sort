Abstract—Association rules mining is an important branch of 
data mining research, which affords interesting relations 
between items of data sets. Minimum support degree is an 
important reference value in association rules mining and its 
threshold is usually given by user. The problem of how to 
determine the threshold when data mining is not researched 
until nowadays. So a selection mining support degree 
algorithm is put forwarded in this paper, and it has important 
significance in practical application.   
Keywords- data mining; association rules; minimum support

I.  INTRODUCTION  
With the increasing popularity of computer application 
and Internet, the conflict between abundance of data and lack 
of knowledge has become more prominent, data in the world 
is growing at an alarming rate. People in different fields are 
looking forward to obtain their answers from the data and 
transform them into knowledge. Knowledge discovery in 
databases (KDD), is a data mining tool, which includes data 
collection, data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, rule 
induction, pattern recognition, data analysis and assessment, 
and visualization etc. KDD is a combination product of 
statistics, computer science, pattern recognition, artificial 
intelligence, machine learning and other subjects, and is 
regarded not only as an important research topic in database 
system and machine learning by many researchers but also as 
an important domain which has tremendous return by many 
business people. The knowledge found from the database can 
be used in information management, decision support, 
process control and many other aspects. From small-scale 
research in 1980s to today's flourish, knowledge discovery 
has been occupied a place in business and scientific 
community. Thus it can be seen that data mining and 
knowledge discovery is a very active research field in recent 
years. 
Association rules mining, which gives an interesting 
relationship between items of data sets, is an important 
research branch in data mining. Since Agrawal et al.[1] 
proposed the concept first in SIGMOD93, research on 
association rules has been a focus of many scholars. 
Minimum support degree, a very important parameter in 
mining association rules, is specified as a threshold by the 
users. However, the problem of how to specify the threshold 
is not researched so far. Therefore, an algorithm for 
specifying minimum support degree is put forward in this 
paper, the algorithm is helpful for users to select the smallest 
support degree in association rules mining. The next part of 
this paper is organized as follows: the proposed problem is 
described in section II, and the minimum support algorithm 
is proposed in section III; then the analysis and discussion of 
the proposed algorithm is performed in the last section. 
II. THE PROPOSED PROBLEM 
Suppose I is a set with m different items, I={i1,i2,…, 
im}, D is a transactions database, each transaction T in it 
includes a series of items in set I, namely T ? I, and TID is 
the only identifier of T. 
Definition 1.If set X ? I, then X is called items set; if X 
includes k items, then X is called k_items set. Suppose X is 
items set, T is a transaction in database, if X ? T, then we 
say that T includes X or T supports X. The support number 
of set X in D, marked X.connt, is referred to the number of 
transaction which includes X; the support degree of set X in 
D, marked X.supD, is referred to the rate of transaction 
which includes X. 
Definition 2.Suppose minsup is the minimum support 
degree threshold, X is items set. If X.sup?minsup, then X is 
called frequent items set, and if X is k_items set, then it is 
called frequent k_items set. Especially, frequent 1_item set 
is called frequent item. 
An association rule is an expression which possesses 
the form as X=>Y, where X ? I, Y ? I, X?Y=?. The 
conditions satisfying the form X=>Y are described as 
follows: 
• The expression possesses support degree minsup, 
namely: 
support(X=>Y) = support(XY)= (XY).supD ,   (1) 
    support(X=>Y)? minsup .                     (2) 
• The expression possesses confidence degree 
minconf, namely: 
confidence(X=>Y)=support(XY)/ support  (X) ,(3) 
confidence(X=>Y) ? minconf .              (4)  
Where minsup is minimum support degree and minconf is 
minimum confidence degree. Minimum support degree is an 
important concept in data mining and no one has researched 
the problem of how to determine the value of it. 
III. THE MINIMUM SUPPORT DEGREE ALGORITHM 
The main idea of the proposed algorithm is described as 
follows: When data mining, the rate of frequent items to all 
items is specified as b by users first, then the minimum 
support degree threshold ? is determined by the value b so

as to the rate of mined frequent items to all items is just b 
when the minimum support degree is ?. According to these, 
the algorithm for selecting minimum support degree is put 
forward. 
1) Input:Items set I={i1,i2,…,im},transactions database D 
and the rate of frequent items to all items b? 
2) Output: minimum support degree threshold ?? 
The algorithm is described as follows: 
1) Step1:Scanning transactions database D once to 
calculate support degree ik.supD of item ik. 
2) Step2:low=0; high=1; ?=1/2; t=1; 
3) Step3:While (t) do{ 
a)  Step3.1:Calculate the rate of frequent items to all 
items b? according to the minimum support degree threshold 
and support degree ik.supD of all items. 
b)  Step3.2:if (abs(b–b?)<0.0001)   
/* abs(x) denotes the absolute value of x*/  
t=0;    
else if (b< b?) 
{ 
low=?; ?=(low+high)/2; 
} 
else  
{ 
high=?; ?=(low+high)/2; 
} 
4)  Step4: return(?). 
 
The idea of half search algorithm is applied in the 
proposed algorithm. When the rate of frequent items to all 
items b? is greater than the value b specified by users, the 
threshold ? should be adjusted greater, otherwise the value ? 
should be adjusted smaller. Furthermore, a method of 
approximate equivalent is adopted in step 3.2 of the proposed 
algorithm. When the absolute value of b–b? is less than 
0.0001, we consider that the value of b is equal to the value 
b?. 
IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION 
Preceding the proposed algorithm, the usual method of 
association rules mining is a mining course by a specified 
minimum support threshold. If the mining result is not 
expected, then the mining course is repeated by adjusting the 
threshold until the mining result attains user’s goal. 
However, how to adjust the threshold brings about an 
intractable problem. Hence, the proposed algorithm is very 
significant in the application of association rules mining. 
Nowadays, the typical algorithms for association rules 
mining are Apriori algorithm[1], FP_Growth algorithm[2] 
and many other improved algorithms[3-7]. The proposed 
algorithm in this paper can be applied in those referred 
algorithms and the scanning times of transactions database 
will not increase. In other words, when using the proposed 
algorithm in association rules mining, the workload is not 
added, but the efficiency is greatly improved.
