Abstract-For the retailing, the shelf space allocation is a key 
issue which impacts on the retailer's product sales and profits 
directly. For the small-scale supermarket, due to the small 
store and the product variety, the traditional 'format style' 
shelf space layout is not appropriate. To solve this problem, a 
shelf space allocation solution based on data mining techniques 
is proposed in this paper. With the introduction of association 
distance, we realize the description of the relevance between 
two any items purchased together in transaction database. 
With the concept of promotions coefficient, we get the 
description of the promotions ability of two items. Based on 
these concepts, with the cluster analysis techniques and the 
association rule mining technique, we propose a resolution 
based on 'island style', and get the optimization and 
automation of shelf space allocation in the small-scale 
supermarket.

I. INTRODUCTION 
For retailers, shelf space allocation is directly related to 
the product sales and profits. To increase sales and profits, 
retailers need to determine which products are on display, as 
well as how to allocate the shelf space in store. Studies have 
shown that the visual impact of products shelf space can 
stimulate the customers' shopping impulse, which occupies 
70 percent of the purchase decision [1]. Good shelf space 
allocation can not only attract customers and reduce product 
inventory, more importantly, it can reduce operating cost and 
increase profits. 
Now, most of literatures about the shelf space allocation 
focus on the model and algorithm. In the algorithm research, 
Corstjens and Dolye designed a generalized geometric 
programming method[2-3]; Yang also put forward a heuristic 
algorithm with regulation[4]; Andrew Lim and Brian 
Rodrigues designed a new heuristic algorithm, network flow 
algorithm and the Five-phase SWOL method[5]; Liang put 
forward a hybrid genetic algorithm and a local search 
algorithm for the problem[6]. However, most of these 
algorithms are local search algorithm, which are difficult to 
find the global optimal solution. In the model search, space 
elasticity is a widely used solution. In this model, taking into 
account of profits, inventory costs and distribution costs. 
However, this model didn't take into account of cross selling. 
Furthermore, the research is aiming at the shopping malls, 
not applicable to the small retail shop. To solve this problem,

we introduce an island-style shelf space allocation solution 
based on the association rule mining and cluster analysis 
techniques. 
Section 2 describes the shelf space allocation problem 
and gives an account of relevant concepts. Section 3 
describes in detail the relevant algorithm. Section 4 presents 
the relevant algorithm with sample data while Section 5 
concludes the paper. 
II. PROBLEM SPECIFICATION 
Among the patterns of shelf layout, the grid-style pattern 
is the most widely used one, especially in the big mall. In 
this layout, shelves and customer channels are arranged as 
rectangular array, main channel and sub-channel are of same 
width, all of the shelves are arranged parallel or at right 
angles. The grid-style pattern has the advantage of a clear 
classification. According to the commodity group, customers 
can quickly fmd the goods they want to purchase. Presently, 
most of literatures about the shelf space allocation are based 
on the pattern. For small-scale shopping malls, in addition to 
the grid-style pattern, it can also adopt an island-style pattern. 
In this pattern, the hypermarkets are arranged as a lot of 
disjointed islands, shelves are arranged in the middle of the 
island to display all kinds of products. 
The solution of the shelf space allocation is achieved by 
the mining of sales data. Firstly, according to the correlation 
between commodities, commodities are analyzed by the 
cluster technique; each of the commodity clusters can form a 
commodity island. Secondly, commodities of the island are 
arranged by promotions coefficients of the commodities. 
Let I={il, i2, ... ,im} be set of items, and T C I be a 
transaction containing a set of items. A database D is a 
collection of transactions. Each transaction in D has a unique 
identifier, denoted by TID. 
Based on the research of the sales data, a computational 
method of association distance between products is proposed. 
Association distance is used to measure the strength of the 
relevance of two kinds of products. 
Definition 1: Let D be a set of transaction T, A and B are 
two any items of set I, then the relevance between A and B 
can be described by association distance, denoted by 
RelDst(A,B).The smaller the value of RelDst(A,B), the 
stronger of the relevance between A and B. 
RelDst(A,B)= 1-( count(AB)/Count(D)i; (1) 
Where count(D) be the number of transactions in D, 
count(AB) be the number of transactions containing both A 
and B in Do 
To measure the promotional strength of commodity A 
and B, a concept named promotions coefficient is introduced. 
By association rule mining, the association rule like' A -B[S, 
c, Q, P]'can be attained. Where S is the support of the rule; 
C is the confidence of the rule; Q is the average purchase 
quantity; P is the gross profit of the commodity A. So, the 
expression Count(D) X S X C X Q X P can express the profit 
arising from the promotional impact from A to B. Before we 
display A and B together for cross-selling, we must consider 
the association rule 'A - B[S,C,Q,P], and 'B­
A[S' ,C' ,Q' ,P,], .So we introduce promotions coefficient, 
denoted by W(A,B). The bigger the value of W(A,B), the 
more obvious the promotions impact between A and B. 
Definition 2: The promotional ability between A and B 
can be described by promotions coefficient, denoted by W 
(A-B) . 
W(A,B) =SXCXQXP+ S'XC' XQ'XP' (2)

We calculate association distances between commodities. 
According to association distances between commodities and 
the number of commodity clusters, we will get commodity 
clusters by cluster analysis based on the minimum distance.

End 
ClusterInfo[ A] .itemsname=ClusterInfo[ A] .itemsname+ 
ClusterInfo[B].itemsname

Algorithm 3: Get the priority of every cluster 
Input: ClusterInfo 
Output: ClusterInfo 
Step I: According to the set of transaction, compute the 
purchase count and average purchase quantity of every 
commodity 
Step 2: According to the purchase count, average 
purchase quantity and unit gross profit, compute the gross 
profit of every commodity cluster 
Step 3: Arrange all clusters by their gross profit 
B. Display of commodities in every cluster 
For commodities in every cluster, we display them in 
shelves according to the priority we get by promotions 
coefficient between them. 
Firstly, we get all association rule like 'A?B[S,C,Q,P]' 
by Apriori algorithm. 
Secondly, we compute promotions coefficient of any two 
commodities, and get their priorities by their promotions 
coefficient.

STEP2: Suppose the number of cluster is 5, we run the 
cluster analysis algorithm 2. The procedure is as follow:

According to algonthm 2, the two clusters which have 
the minimum distance are {A} and {B} , then they will be 
merged into a new cluster {A,B} , and the count of clusters 
will be 7. The result is shown in table VIII.

Slmdar to the preViOUS context, we merge {A,B} and {C} 
into a new cluster {A,B,C} , and the count will be 6. The 
result is shown in table IX.

After running the algorithm, we will get five commodity 
clusters {A,B,C,D} ,{E} ,{F},{G} and {H} . 
STEP3: Get the priority of every cluster 
STEP3.l: According to the transaction set, we will get 
the commodity model with purchase count and average 
quantity. The result is shown in table XI.

6 F I 2 0.4 
7 G I I 0.2 
8 H I 2 0.6 
. .  STEP3.2: Accordmg to data of commodItIes and cluster, 
we can get the gross profit of every cluster. For example, the 
gross profit of cluster {A,B,C,D} is as follow: 
6*(13/6)*0.2+6*(1116)*0.3+7*(917)*0.1 +2*2*0.1 =7.2 
The result is shown in table XII.

So, the priority order is {A,B,C,D} --{H}--{E} --{F}-­
{G} . 
STEP4: We can get all of the 2-item association rule by 
algorithm Apriori. The result of cluster {A,B,C,D} is 
shown in table XIII.

We can express the promotions relationship of every 
commodity by network diagram, the numeric value of every 
edge is the promotions coefficient of adjacent commodity. 
The network diagram of cluster {A, B, C, D} is shown in 
figure 1. 
According to optimization theory, in the network 
diagram, we can find many paths to connect all commodities; 
we choose the path which has the maximum value of?W. So, 
in the cluster {A, B, C, D} , we can find the priority order is 
D--B--A--C.

V. CONCLUSION 
The optimization of shelf space allocation is a difficult 
problem and a very important area of research. Based on 
association rule mining and cluster analysis techniques, a 
two-step solution containing formation of clusters and layout 
of commodities in cluster is proposed in this paper. To 
measure the strength of promotions between two 
commodities, promotions coefficient is defined. With 
network diagram, a method of displaying commodities in 
commodity cluster is proposed.
