1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Spatial data mining refers to extracting and “mining” the 
hidden, implicit, valid, novel and interesting spatial or non-
spatial patterns or rules from large-amount, incomplete, 
noisy, fuzzy, random, and practical spatial databases [2]. 
However, spatial data mining research is currently focused 
on the efficiency of mining algorithm itself, while there are 
few studies in practical application. Association rules 
mining is an important part in spatial data mining. 
Therefore, mining metallogenic association rules will be 
worthwhile and provide some reference for evaluation of 
mineral resources. The study of spatial data uncertainty is 
particularly important [1, 2]. In the data preprocessing, use 
the cloud model to get uncertain transition between 
qualitative and quantitative in data so that it can reduces 
the data uncertainties impact. We developed the Apriori 
algorithm which can deal with relational table directly so 
that relational table need not be transformed to binary 
transaction. Finally, combining the cloud model based 
generation method with Apriori algorithm [4] for mining 
association rules and metallogenic prediction using the 
spatial geological data of Eastern Kunlun orogenic belt 
shows its efficiency and effectiveness. 
 
2. METHOD 
 
2.1 Attribute Generalization Based on Cloud Model 
 
Cloud model is a model of the uncertain transition between 
a linguistic term of a qualitative concept and its numerical 
representation. In short, it is a model of the uncertain 
transition between qualitatives and quantitatives [3]. The 
unique definition of cloud is that only with the expectation 
Ex, entropy En and ultra-entropy He three values can be 
outlined by the tens of thousands of cloud droplets formed 
cloud, said the language of the qualitative value of the 
ambiguity and randomness fully integrated together to 
achieve a soft discretization of data. The normal 
compatibility clouds are most useful in representing 
linguisticatoms and the MEC [3, 7] (mathematical expected 
Curve) of the normal compatibility cloud to a 
linguisticatom A is:

Fig.1 Linguistic atoms for the linguistic variable “Iron geochemical anomaly” 
 
Firstly, based on the above definition, this experiment 
chooses the quantitative property iron geochemical anomaly 
as discrete objects. Secondly concept definition and 
description, Iron geochemical anomaly domain is [0, 10], 
be divided into three concepts: Iron geochemical anomaly 
high, Iron geochemical anomaly middle, and Iron 
geochemical anomaly low atoms, each linguistic variable 
have some overlaps in Fig1. Experts give the Ex, En, He in 
the cloud model to define linguistic atoms. Thirdly, input 
Iron geochemical anomaly numerical data to achieve 
quantitative conversion and output results as text. 
 
2.2 Mining Metallogenic Association Rules 
 
Apriori algorithm was first proposed by Agrawal et al in 
1993[4]. Association rule mining finds interesting 
association or correlation relationships among a large set of 
data items [4, 6]. However, Apriori algorithm is only used 
for mining association rules among one-dimensional binary 
data. We developed the Apriori algorithm and it can deal 
with relational table directly so that relational table need 
not be transformed to binary transaction. The problem of 
discovering all association rules can be decomposed into 
two subproblems. Firstly, find all sets of items that have 
transaction support above minimum support. The support 
for an itemsets is the number of transactions that contain 
the itemset. Itemsets with minimum support are called 
large itemsets, and all others small itemsets. Secondly, use 
the large itemsets to generate the desired rules. For every 
such subset a, output a rule of the form a => (l-a) if the 
ratio of support (l-a) to support (a) is at least minconf. We 
use support, confidence, and coverage, interesting, leverage, 
lift and N (number of rule antecedents) on quality 
evaluation of association rules. And each rule has a K 
which was used as comprehensive evaluating target. K was 
calculated by quality evaluations mentioned above 
multiplied by each weighting according to AHP (Analytic 
Hierarchy Process) after being standard. Formulas of every 
quality evaluation are as follows. 
 
Support(A?B)=P?A?B? 
Confidence?A?B?=P?B|A? 
Lift(A?B)=P(B)/P(AUB) 
Coverage = N(A)/N 
Leverage = P(B|A)-(P(B)*P(A)) 
Interesting = ((P(X?Y)/P(X)*P(Y))K-1)*(P(X)*P(Y))m 
The follows are the standard formulas:

In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our 
uncertain spatial data mining model, we conducted 
experiment using geospatial data of eastern Kunlun 
orogenic belt in China, which contains geoscientific data 
and geochemical data. After extracting, the task relevant 
data are 481 records. It has seven attributes, the regional 
fault trend, ore-bearing rocks, wall rock alteration, and ore 
body status, the size of deposits, iron anomaly, and genetic 
type of deposit.

The task relevant data are organized as a relational table. 
Since iron geochemical anomalies are numerical, it is 
impossible to discover strong association rules at the 
primary level directly. Therefore, we define linguistic atoms 
for attribute generalization which has been done in the 
previous step. The generalized database is mined with the 
minimum support 3% and minimum confidence 80%. We 
will use “contact metasomatism hydrothermal iron ore” as 
the rule consequent and the other properties as the rule 
antecedent. There are many rules in the data mining 
processing, and they can be described in the form of 
production rules, such as table 1. 
 
3. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
 
3.1 Data Preprocessing 
 
In this research, vector ore-controlling data of stratum, 
unconformity, fault, regional chemical anomaly, remote 
sensing mineralization anomaly, bouguer anomaly, 
aeromagnetic anomaly and Gold mineral occurrence are 
used. All of those data were grid partitioned. Based on 
Weights of Evidence Modeling, the stratum as background 
layer, the grid is partitioned to 1km*1km in GIS software. 
All of the layers’ data were overlaid and spatially joined to 
the newly created grid layer, and every grid polygon in grid 
layer owns corresponding attributes of other layers, which 
was an itemset in the association rules. 
To unconformity, fault and mineral occurrence, the feature 
data should be buffered. Based on Weights of Evidence 
Modeling, the buffering distances are different, 1000m 
point buffer to mineral occurrence, 300m line buffer to 
unconformity, 3000m line buffer to fault for for iron mine. 
 
3.2 Metallogenic Association Rules Assessment 
 
After getting the association rules above, then we use the 
attribute table of grid generated mentioned in the data part 
to compare with the association rules. There will be three 
conditions for each record in the attribute table: the 
record’s items are the same as one of the rules’ antecedent; 
the record’s items are the same as many of the rules’s 
antecedents; there are no rules’ antecedents are the same as 
the record’s items. If there are no rules’ antecedents are the 
same as the record of attribute of table, its K was set 0. If 
there are many rules’ antecedents are the same as the items 
of the record, choose the maximum K as its K.  
 
3.3 Results 
 
At last, every polygon of the grid layer has a K, and all of 
the Ks are joined in grid layer in GIS environment, then the 
maps of regional metallogenic potential prediction 
areplotted with grading and color separating. Fig. 2 shows 
metallogenic potential of contact metasomatic iron mine in 
east Kunlun area in China.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
The experiments show that the model of uncertainty-based 
metallogenic association rules mining is efficient, the whole 
process is efficient. At the same time, combining cloud 
model and Aprirori algorithm mining association rules in 
the geological mineralization can provide some reference 
for evaluation of mineral resources. The prediction map to 
contact metasomatic iron shows that known iron mines are 
exactly matched with the high potential areas, and the 
distribution trends of potential prediction areas are 
consistent with the direction of stratum and fault, which 
shows that the model of uncertainty-based metallogenic 
association rules mining in metallogenic prediction is 
effective. In addition, the high potential area is about 10% 
of the whole area, and the medium potential area is about 
15% of the whole area. While, calculation given by 
Weights of Evidence Modeling shows that the upper limit 
of  better area is 10% to high potential, and 15% to medium 
potential. However, in the experiments spatial relationships 
were not discussed, this is where the future experiments 
need to be improved.
