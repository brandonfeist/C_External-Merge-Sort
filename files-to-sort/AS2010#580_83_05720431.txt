Abstract- This paper presents AgriMine which is a tool that was 
developed in order to mine agricultural problems accumulated in 
a textual database over a period of 5 years. The problems, which 
are accompanied by their solutions, offer a wealth of knowledge 
that can be used by decision makers, researchers, and farmers 
alike. However, this wealth of knowledge cannot be unlocked 
without first representing these problems in a structured format, 
and secondly applying algorithms that can summarize and 
analyze this information. Towards the achievement of the first 
goal, a multi-faceted object extraction methodology is presented, 
and for the achievement of the second, association rules are 
employed. As a proof of concept, the tool was applied of a set of 
weed problems. The presented methodology can be modified to 
work with any help and support textual database where both 
problems and their solutions are present.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The advent of the Web has facilitated the communication 
between organizations and corporations and their clients as 
many of those now offer web based help and support services 
whereby users can enter problems they face in free text format 
and have an expert or specialist respond to them also in free 
text. The accumulation of such problems and their solutions 
offers a wealth of knowledge that can only be unlocked by 
analyzing these texts and extracting useful information from 
them. This paper presents the initial approach and results of 
doing just that on a subset of problems extracted from 
VERCON's "Farmers problems" database [1]. 
VERCON(the Virtual Extension and Research Communication 
Network) was established in order to improve the 
communication between research institutions and extension 
personal for the benefit of growers and agrarian businesses. 
One of VERVON's main components is the "Farmers 
Problems Database" which was created in order to address 
farmer problems for which there are no officially published 
978-1-61284-185-4/111$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 81 
recommendations. The idea of this component is a simple one: 
through a web based interface, a user can input hislher problem 
using some basic meta-data descriptors that specifY hislher 
location, the nature of the problem being entered, and the crop 
for which this problem has been encountered. Slhe would then 
go on to enter a free text description of the problem listing all 
concerns and additional important parameters within the text 
itself. The problem would then be forwarded to a researcher 
who would reply in free text telling the farmer what slhe 
should do to address the problem. The idea was that someone 
with a problem can search this resource for a similar problem 
to hislhers and readily find a response to hislher concern. If 
such a solution could not be found, then the person can post 
their problem, have it answered by an expert, and avail the 
complaint and its solution to other users of the system. Over a 
period of five years, this valuable resource has grown to 
contain 10,000+ problems and their solutions all stored in a 
textual database. 
The goal of this work is to create a tool capable of taking in 
these problems and presenting a summary of expert opinions 
on these in a way that can help a reader spot and address any 
inconsistencies or pin-point desired information depending on 
who the reader is. The reader of this report can be a decision 
maker interested in knowing what the widespread problems are 
in rural areas, and whether recommendations given to 
complainers agree or contradict with approved 
recommendations. The reader of this report, may also be a 
scientist or a researcher interested in discovering unknown 
relationships among a set of certain features. A farmer or a 
grower may also use this tool in-order to determine the most 
likely course of action that should be taken when faced with a 
particular problem. To develop such a tool, information 
extraction/opinion mining techniques were employed in 
conjunction with natural language processing and data mining 
techniques. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
elaborates on the extraction problem by defining it within the 
context of the presented work, section 3 presents related work, 
section 4 describes the developed tool, section 5 shows how 
the tool was deployed, and finally section 6 concludes this 
paper and lists areas of future work. 
II. THE EXTRACTION PROBLEM: DEFINED 
By examining a sample of complaints and solutions entered 
into the VERCON problem database, it was found that a single 
complaint may contain 1 or more primary complaint objects 
(explicitly or implicitly specified) often supported with 
additional complaint features. An implicitly implied complaint 
object, is one that is not explicitly entered by the complainer, 
and which is usually deduced and stated by the expert 
answering the user's query. For example, a user entering a 
complaint about a disease may not even know what the 
disease is and may simply describe it in terms of symptoms 
occurring on various plant parts. An expert would take this, 
and in most cases will provide the disease name as well as 
advice as to how to address this problem. The disease in this 
case, is the primary object of the complaint, and the symptoms 
entered by the user are the supporting features. Each of these 
features typically describe a specific plant part, and the 
extraction process has to differentiate between these. An 
expert often describes alternative solutions rather than just 
one. So extracting each of these without confusing features 
associated with each, is one of the extraction challenges. A 
close look at various entered problems and their solutions 
revealed that farmers and experts alike, enter problems and 
solutions with varying degrees of details. 
The following is an example of typical complaint retrieved 
from the textual database of VERCON. The complaint has 
been translated from Arabic to English: 
There are spots on the leaves and on the spikes which 
have a cotton like texture and which turn to grey in 
some areas within the planted 25 feddan land. 
The main object of the complaint (the disease) is not 
apparent in this text, but we need to identity that the complaint 
objects are the leaf and spike, and that the complaint features 
describing each are the spots that have cotton like texture 
and a color that is changing to grey. More formally, the 
attributes of the spot feature will be as follows: color = grey, 
and texture = cotton like So if we find the same features in 
another complaint then we can predict that these two 
complaints are similar. However, in real life it is rare to have 
two problems with the exact same features. For example, the 
following is another similar complaint that has a different 
wording and features: 
There are white, non-uniform spots with cotton like 
texture on the lower surface of plant leaves. 
Here the complaint object is the leaf, and the feature 
associated with this descriptor is spots which have the 
following attributes: (color = white, texture = cotton like, 
location = lower surface, and distribution= non-uniform). The 
two problems partially match in terms of problem features as 
82 
they both have spots on the leaves characterized by the a cotton 
like texture. However, this information on its own is not 
enough to deduce that the two problems are actually similar. 
Looking at the solutions for both problems, we find that the 
solution is the same. We also find that the experts responding 
to the query name "Powdery mildew" as the cause of the 
complaint thus we can consider this disease as the main object 
of the complaint. So the solution can actually help in the 
production of generalization rules that can determine problems 
that are similar to each other. These rule can then be used for 
finding a solution to a previously unseen complaint by 
matching this complaint to those previously solved ones which 
are similar to it. The result displayed to the user with the input 
complaint can be a "standard solution" which was previously 
stored for all similar problems, or simply a list of all solutions 
that have previously been offered to stored similar complaints. 
III. RELATED WORK 
This work aims at analyzing growers' complaints to come 
up with causes and features of these complaints and their 
solutions. This area of research has some similarity with 
opinion mining which has appeared recently to assist customers 
to sort through product reviews before making a purchase as it 
has become very difficult to go through the huge amount of 
reviews available on the web. The growers' complaints 
represent negative opinions about agricultural objects such as 
soil, water, climate, plant and others. We can make an analogy 
between these multiple objects hidden in the complaints and 
opinion mining of product reviews. 
Most opinion mining systems rely on identitying the 
product features and their possible associated opinions. For 
example, the feature "display" is associated with opinion words 
like "bright", "dark", and "clear" for a mobile phone product 
(2]. In (3], Hu and Liu proposed an automatic way to extract 
product features from English product reviews using 
Association Rule Mining (4]. In (5] Berland and Charniak 
proposed a method to extract 'part-of' features, using 
possessive constructions and prepositional phrases from news 
corpora. In (6], Yi et al extract both 'part-of' and 'attribute-of' 
features from online reviews. In (7], Popescu and Etzioni, 
extract explicit features for the given product class from parsed 
review data, and use PM! assessment to evaluate each 
candidate feature. (8] present a method based on identitying all 
domain-related phrases and then discriminating them into 
features and products. 
Extracting opinion words that describe a certain feature is a 
challenging problem and so is the identification of product 
features. The opinion word dictionary is typically generated by 
collecting adjectives expressing positive or negative opinion 
and then automatically searching for synonyms and antonyms 
using a semantic lexicon such as WordNet (9] (3]. In (10], Liu 
et aI, propose an Opinion Observer from which users can 
clearly see the advantage and weakness of each product in the 
minds of other consumers. Their work has boosted the 
development of new techniques and systems for opinion 
analysis.

The presented work has to address the handling of 
multiple objects and not a single product which is the focus of 
most of the current research done in opinion mining. The work 
makes use of an ontology to discover these multiple objects 
and to identity their features. 
IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVELOPED TOOL 
As stated before, the goal of this work is to create a tool 
capable of producing a summary of expert opinions on various 
problems and in different ways depending on who the user is. 
For this to happen, problems in the "Farmers problems 
database" must first be stored in a structured format. This takes 
place t?r0ugh an object extractor. The object extraction process 
IS carned out once on all problems in the database, and again, 
whenever new problems and their solutions are entered into the 
textual database. After the problems are stored in the database 
association rules [4] can be applied in order to extract 
meaningful patterns and relations from the agricultural data 
stored in the structured database. Association rules offer a 
powerful technique whereby analysts and researchers can 
uncover hidden patterns within large data sets. To facilitate this 
process, a web based interface is used to allow an expert user to 
select features that s/he want to apply association rules on. The 
tool allows the user to enter the minimum required support for 
the extrapolation of a meaningful relation where support is 
defined as the probability that a certain problem and its 
soluti?n contain a given feature or set of features. If a support 
value IS not reached in any given relation, then chances are that 
this relation is not a significant one. Examining the results can 
allow a developer to select important relationships, label them, 
and avail them to other users of the tool. 
Figure 1 presents the tool's architecture. So the main 
components of this tool are the feature extractor, the 
association rule engine, and the web based interface. Each of 
these is described briefly in the following subsections: 
83 
A. The object extractor 
The object extractor takes in as input problems and their 
solutions and generates as output, a structured representation of 
each in the form of feature tuples that can be stored in a 
database. To carry out this task, the extractor makes use of an 
Agricultural ontology as well of extraction templates coupled 
with extraction rules. In the textual complaints database, 
metadata is provided to classity problems according to the 
issues they deal with. For example, typical classifications 
include "weeds", "diseases", "pests", "fertilization", and 
"irrigation". For each of these categories, a hand crafted 
extraction template is created. A filled in template would 
represent a problem and its solution. So basically, a template 
specifies objects that can be extracted from either and their 
type. A meta-tag associated with each problem and its solution 
aids the extractor to determine which templates and rules it 
should apply. Objects to extract are defined as one of five 
possible types: Named entities, time based entities numbers 
percentages and rates. In this work, the use of an ?ntology i? 
Instrumental. An ontology plays a major role in the 
identification of agricultural objects which are the named 
entities of concern in this work. The ontology not only includes 
specific objects, but also their associated features and the 
possible attributes for these. For the extraction task all 
ontology entries are read, stemmed, and stored in 
'
their 
stemmed form. Stemming of Arabic is far more complicated 
than that of English because of its inflected nature. Since the 
accuracy of this step can affect the overall accuracy of the 
system, the stemmer presented in [11] and which emphasizes 
accuracy, was used to carry out this task. When parsing an 
input complaint (which is actually the complaints and its 
solution) , the complaint's text is scanned word by word. A 
search for each stemmed version of word is then carried out 
within the stemmed version of the ontology. If a match is 
found, then the object associated with the word, is said to have 
been identified. For example, when the word "??" is 
encountered and searched within the ontology, it will be found 
to be associated with the 'Weed' object. The object and the 
location where it was encountered (word number and sentence 
number) are both stored. This is important as we define a 
context window for the identification of related features. For 
example, a pesticide has three related features which are: 
concentration (percentage), time _ oC Application( time based 
entity), rate_oCapplication(rate). So, if a pattern matching any 
of these features is detected in the object's vicinity, then its 
associated feature can be extracted and the value of its attribute 
set. 
A number is easy to extract as it usually follows a known 
number format. Time based entities can appear as a number 
followed by a unit of time as for example: I day, 2 months, 3 
years, or they can simply be represented in pure text as for 
example: after a week. A percentage entity is usually a number 
followed by a percentage mark and is often a property of a 
named entity. A rate refers to an amount of one thing 
considered in relation to a unit of another thing (Kilos per 
Feddan, dollars/hour, etc). Regular expressions are employed 
for the extraction of these three entities. 
When defining an extraction template, a user can indicate 
that certain objects are context objects, and can define context 
windows for the extraction of their associated features. Other 
objects which are features for this object are associated with 
this object through a context field which lists this object as 
their context. A user can also specify a certain object as the 
main object of a complaint (MaC) and another as a main 
object of a solution (MaS). During the extraction process, a 
tuple is for each solution and its complaint is created. This 
tuple, is replicated each time a new MaC or MaS is 
encountered. 
B. The structured complaint and solution database 
The structured complaint and solution database is a 
relational database that is used to store information about 
objects that were extracted by the object extractor. Each class 
of problems (eg .. Weeds, Fertilization, etc) has its own table 
where tuples generated by the object extractor are stored. Each 
tuple in the database represents a complete problem and its 
solution. Since the design of a tuple takes into consideration 
all features that may be part of a problem and its solution, a 
tuple is always only partially filled. 
C. The association rule engine 
The association rule engine takes as input, a problem's 
class, crop, and features of interest, and retrieves all tuples 
related to these from the structured database (frequent 
item sets ) . The apriorio association rule algorithm is then 
applied to those in order to calculate the probable co­
occurrence of features within the frequent itemsets using the 
support and confidence metrics. As stated before, support 
reflects how frequently features in an itemset occur together, 
while confidence is the conditional probability of the feature 
that represents "the then part an association rule" given the rest 
of the features which represent the "if part of the rule". These 
results are then returned to the component that originally called 
84 
the engine (the web based user interface m our 
implementation). 
D. The web based user interface 
The web based user interface is the means by which a user 
can invoke and make use of the developed tool. It allows the 
user to select the class of problems s/he is interested in as well 
as the specific crop for which various reports are to be 
generated. Once these two factors have been selected, the user 
can either choose to view patterns and relations that were 
previously defined by a developer/an expert user, or if this is a 
more advanced user s/he can create his/her own report by 
selecting features s/he is interested in as well as a threshold 
value. In case the user wants the former type of report, s/he can 
choose between two kinds: brief or detailed. Brief reports make 
use of predefined support thresholds, while detailed reports 
display all possible relationships even if these have a very low 
support. In both cases, both the support and confidence values 
are displayed to the user. 
The user interface also takes in as input a list of any 
prohibited material such as prohibited pesticides or herbicides, 
and whenever any of these appear in a relation, it highlights 
them in red. Another list that can be input to user interface is a 
list of weeds, diseases, pests, or any kind of a problem for 
which there is a published recommendation. Problems derived 
from the problem database that do not match with any entries 
in this list, are highlighted in orange so as to bring the attention 
of decision makers to the fact that there might be a problem 
that warrants their attention. 
V. DEPLOYMENT 
For the purpose of experimentation, a subset of the 
problems and their solutions were selected from VERCON's 
textual database for use as a proof of concept as to the 
usefulness of the tool. These were problems related to 
"Weeds." The reason this specific class of problems was 
selected is due to the fact that it represents the biggest class of 
problems in the textual database. After applying association 
rules to these, the following set of useful patterns and 
relationships were identified: 
1. The distribution of weeds over governorates. 
2. The distribution pattern of weed problems among 
planting methods. 
3. The most commonly used herbicides and their 
occurrence frequency. 
4. Relationship between a certain weed and a 
specific herbicide. 
5. Relationship between the control method and 
control time. 
6. Relationship between herbicides and control 
times. 
7. Breakdown of weeds into (wide and narrow 
weeds) and their occurrence frequency.

8. The relationship between generalized weeds and 
herbicides. 
A user can have access to these relationships directly 
using the interface displayed in figure 2. Alternatively, a user 
may choose to experiment with other types of relations that 
s/he can define through another interface. Figure 3, 
exemplifies a sample of a brief report which represents the 
relationship between a certain weed and a specific herbicide 
(herbicide properties such as concentration and rate are listed 
as well). For a grower, this report can inform himlher of what 
they should probably use if s/he encounters any of the listed 
weeds and for a decision maker this can serve to verify 
recommendations by the ministry. The distribution of weeds 
over governorates can inform decision makers and researchers 
alike, of where to expect infestations of certain weeds across 
the country. Pronounced infestations in certain governorates 
may warrant specific actions that might lead to the reduction of 
these infestations. Using this system on real problems has 
revealed that farmers reported three weeds for which there 
were no published recommendations. It has also shown, that 
experts have recommended four herbicides that have been 
prohibited by the government. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper has presented a tool for mining agricultural 
problems and their solutions. The tool can aid in the discovery 
of patterns and relations that may point to certain types of 
widespread problems and pressing needs of people living in 
rural areas. Consequently, decision makers could be able to 
take necessary actions to tackle these pressing problems and 
needs of poor communities and direct development plans 
toward these needs. The tool can also be used by researchers 
for the discovery of unknown relationships among a set of 
certain features and by farmers in-order to determine the most
