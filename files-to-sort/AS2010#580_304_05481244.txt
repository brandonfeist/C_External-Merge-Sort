Abstract—Mining association rules is an important issue in 
KDD applications. In this paper, we first use the cloud model 
to dynamically divide attribute value to overcome the 
shortcoming that the concept was partitioned by experience, 
and then explore the application of cloud models in mining 
association rules from credit card database by the improved 
Apriori algorithm. The result of experiment shows that the 
method is effective and flexible in holding uncertainties. By 
analyzing cloud association rules, valuable advice can be 
provided for the commercial banks to implement 
personalized marketing.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In large relational database, it is difficult and 
unnecessary to find the relationship among the attributes at 
the primary level, because there are lots of distinct values 
for numerical attribute. People usually concern about the 
association rules at high concept level, such as the 
relationship of education level and incoming[3]. However, 
in practice the partition of the concept is often designated 
by people, the result is identical at any occasion. It can not 
reflect people’s different view at the same thing. The cloud 
is a method of describing uncertain problem. It 
comprehensively considers randomness and fuzziness, can 
be used interchangeably to bridge the gap between 
quantitative and qualitative. So if we use the cloud  model 
to dynamically divided attribute value , the shortcoming 
that the concept was partitioned by experience will be 
overcome. 
At present, the cloud theory has been widely applied 
in many fields, such as the partition of fuzzy region in 
image processing, comprehensive evaluation of shooting 
athletes, association rules and prediction, etc[2][3][4]. 
Thus, the cloud model is presented to mine association 
rules in the paper. First of all, we use a set of 1-D cloud 
model to dynamically divide every attribute value. 
Secondly, the credit card database are further scanned by 
the improved Apriori Algorithm, to find out all cloud 
association rules which have support and confidence 
greater than user-specified minimum support and 
minimum confidence respectively. Finally, the customers’ 
consuming awareness and tendency are summarized based 
on the analysis of the cloud association rules, to implement 
personalized marketing and provide different services for 
the credit card customers.  
 
II. CLOUD MODEL 
The Cloud is brought forward by Prof. De-yi Li. It is 
the uncertain switch model between the qualitative concept 
and its expression of number with uncertainty and 
randomness [7]. The cloud is composed of many of cloud 
drops. A drop is one-time value of qualitative concept. The 
total cloud reflects the radical character of fuzzy concept. 
U(the universe of discourse) is defined as  U={u} .                                   
 T is the language value related to U. The degree of 
pertain which is called as CT(u), is the degree that u 
belongs to U. The number feature of cloud is signified 
with the expected value, entropy and hyper entropy. So 
the cloud model is recorded as A(Ex,En,He). The expected 
value Ex is the center value of the concept. The entropy 
En is defined by the bandwidth of the MEC(mathematical 
expected curve) of the normal cloud showing how many 
elements in the universe of discourse could be accepted. 
The MEC of the normal cloud is defined by the following 
formula:

A E
EuuMEC ??=                        (1) 
The entropy He is the uncertain degree of cloud drop. 
If the number characteristics Ex, En and He of the cloud 
are given, the following algorithm can be used to produce 
normal cloud[3].  
?1?The normal random number xi  is calculated by the 
following formula:  
                     ),( nxi EEGx =                                  (2) 
?2?Then the normal random number ' inE  is created 
with the entropy En and the standard deviation He  by the 
following formula: 
                            ),(
' HeEGE nn i =                             (3)

The above algorithm can be implemented in both 
hardware and software, which is named as cloud 
generator[8].Figure1 shows a 1-D forward cloud 
generator. Correspondingly, given six digital 
characteristics Ex,Enx,Hex,Ey,Eny and Hey, to represent a 
two-dimensional linguistic atom, the 2-D cloud generator 
could produce any number of drops of clouds. Figure2 
shows a 2-D forward cloud generator.

Given a limited set of drops as samples of a cloud, 
the three digital characteristics Ex, En and He could be 
produced to represent the corresponding atom. This kind 
of atom generator is called backward generator, denoted 
by CG-1. Figure 3 and figure 4 show a 1-D backward 
cloud generator and a 2-D backward cloud generator 
respectively.

quantitative and qualitative knowledge. 
III. ASSOCIATION RULES AND CLOUD ASSOCIATION 
RULES 
A. The concept of association rule 
Let I={i1,i2,…,im} be a set of n binary attributes called 
items. Let D be a set of transactions called the database. 
Each transaction T in D has a unique transaction ID and 
contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is defined as an 
implication of the form X?Y, where X?I, Y?I and 
X?Y=?. The sets of items X and Y are called antecedent 
(left-hand-side or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or 
RHS) of the rule respectively[10]. 
1) support and confidence  
The support of the rule X?Y is defined as the 
proportion of transactions in the database D that contain 
X ? Y . 
                  )()( YXPYXSUPP ?=?                            (5) 
 The confidence of the rule X?Y  is defined as the 
proportion of transactions in the database D that contain X 
also contain Y. 
          )|(
)(
)()( XYP
XSUPP
YXSUPPYXconf =?=?                (6) 
We usually use the constraints which is minimum 
thresholds on support and confidence to select interesting 
rules from the set of all possible rules. 
2) frequent  itemset  
A set of item is called as itemset?k-itemset denotes 
an itemset including k items. An itemset with a support? 
the minimum support threshold is called a frequent itemset. 
Lk  denotes a set of  frequent k-itemset. 
Given a database of D, the problem of mining 
association rules is to generate all association rules that 
have support and confidence greater than user-specified 
minimum support and minimum confidence respectively. 
To achieve this, association rule generation is a two-step 
process. First, minimum support is applied to find all 
frequent itemsets in a database. In the second step, these 
frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint 
are used to form rules. 
B. Cloud Association Rules 
Cloud association rule[3] is an association rule which 
is generated based on the division of the attribute domain 
by using cloud model.   
Let D={t1, t2,…,tn} be a database and I={i1,i2,…,im} 
denote the set of attributes where tj indicates the jth record 
of T, and tj[ik] is the value of its attribute ik.   
We assume that the definition domain, ikF ,of the 
attribute ik, can be divided into many concepts by cloud 
model. And hence we have },...,,{
21 l
ikikikik fffF = ,
j
ik
f  denote 
the jth category in kiF . The symbols 
j
ik
Ex ,  
j
ik
En and 
j
ik
He  
represent the digital characteristic of the concept 
j
ik
f . 
Let X and Y be the subset of I, X and Y denote as  
}...,,{ and },...,,{ ,2121 qp yyyYxxxX ==  with ?=?YX . 
Supposing that ixf (i=1,2,…,p) and iyf (j=1,2,…,q) be the 
concept of the attribute xi and yi  in the universe of 
discouse, the set A is the form 
of },...,,{ 21 xpxx fffA = .Similarly the set B is the form 
of },...,,{ 21 yqyy fffB =  .Let BACYXZ ?=?= , , and then 
the cloud association rules we discussed are following the 
form that if X?A then Y?B. 
IV. APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON CLOUD MODEL 
The Apriori algorithm[6] proposed by R. Agrawal in 
1994 is one of the most effective data mining algorithms 
for mining frequent itemset in transactional database. This 
algorithm repeats a level-wise method to mining frequent 
itemsets. The essential idea is to iteratively generate the 
frequent (k+1)-itemsets from the set of frequent k-itemsets 
(for k?1). First of all, the frequent 1-itemsets are picked 
out, denoted as L1. Secondly generate the set of candidate 
itemsets Ck2 with 2 items from L1, and then the frequent 2-
itemsets L2 are generated by checking candidate itemsets. 
Repeat this process until no new frequent k -itemsets can 
be found. 
For a given database D? the mining of the cloud 
association rules are to find out the fuzzy association rules , 
which have support and confidence greater than user-
specified minimum support and minimum confidence 
respectively by the improved Apriori algorithm, after 
dividing the definition domain of attributes in the database 
D by the cloud model. The steps of Apriori algorithm[2] 
can be described as the following: 
Input? the transaction database D?minimum support 
threshold min_sup.  
Output?all of frequent itemset in  D. 
L1=find_frequent_1-itemsets(D)? 
  for(k=2?Lk-1 ??  ?k++){

return FALSE? 
V. CLOUD ASSOCIATION RULES APPLYING IN CREDIT 
CARD MARKETING 
In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of  
the normal cloud in mining association rules, we 
conducted experiment by using a credit card database. And 
We selected 237 credit card customers from the database. 
The analyzing data is described in the Table I. 
Since the attributes are numerical and categorical in the 
Table I, it is impossible to discover strong association rules 
with the Apriori algorithm at the primary level directly. 
The attributes, not only numerical attributes but also the 
nominal and categorical attributes, can be generalized to 
multiple concept levels with the cloud model. So it is 
preferable to generalize the attributes first and then mine 
rules with the generalized data.  
For instance, the attribute Age is numerical type in the 
Table I, should be generalized by using 1-D forward and 
backward generator. Therefore the attribute Age can be 
partitioned into five ranges: A1[18-22], A2[23-34], A3[35-
40], A4[41-60],A5[60 and above]. Similarly, according to 
our country present situation, the incoming will also be 
divided into four scopes in the same way :W1[?3000 
above], W2[ ? 2000- ? 3000],W3[ ? 1000- ? 2000], 
W4[?1000 below]. 
In addition, the attribute of career is categorical, which 
should to be generalized according to the actual situation. 
Hence, its domain can be classified into seven 
types ,denoted as following: O1={ Public Servant}, 
O2={Teacher, Doctor}, O3={Lawyer,Finance Practitioner}, 
O4={Military, Journalist},O5={Enterpriser, Clerk}, 
O6={Student},O7={Others}. The attribute of education is 
the same as career. So it can be classified into five types in 
the same way: X1={Master and above}, X2={Bachelor}, 
X3={College}, X4={ Technical School, High School}, 
X5={Others}. Parts of transformed data are shown in the 
Table II. 
We assign minimum support threshold and the 
minimum confidence threshold 10% and 80% respectively. 
Five association rules are generated with the improved 
Apriori algorithm based on the normal cloud model. The 
rules can be described in the Table III.  
The first rule indicates that the expenditure pattern of 
consumers is E5F1 if education is “post-graduate degree or 
above”. The confidence of this rule is 87.4% and the 
support is 23.2%. 
And the 5th rule shows if education is “post-graduate 
degree or above”, occupation is “teacher or doctor”, and 
incoming exceeds 3000, then the probability that 
expenditure pattern of consumers is  E5F1  is  80.5%. The 
support of this rule is 12.8%. 
Based on the analysis of the above association rules, 
we can draw a conclusion that the bank should pay more 
attention to the customers whose expenditure pattern is 
E5F1. This kind of customers is usually well-educated, and 
their work and incoming are relatively stable. According to 
their consumption demand, mainly including housing, 
automobile, education and so on, the products supplied for 
them should be primarily consisted of the personal credit 
class. And the bank should provide fast, convenient service 
for them in order to increase customer satisfaction. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In the paper, we firstly use the cloud model for data 
preprocessing in mining association rules, then adopt the 
improved Apriori Algorithm to mine association rules in a 
large credit card transaction database at high concept level. 
The result of experiment shows that this approach, 
combining the cloud model based on generalization 
method with Apriori algorithm, is superior to the 
conventional method in holding uncertainties. Furthermore, 
based on the analysis of the cloud association rules, we can 
find the relation of customer’s consumption behavior and 
their attributes, such as education, incoming, age, 
occupation and summarize the different types of 
customers’ consuming awareness and tendency in order to 
carry on the personalized marketing and provide the 
differentiated service for the credit card customers.
