Abstract-An effective tracking method is proposed to solve 
the problem that the electro-optical tracking system in 
Missile Range easily loses the real target during the target 
separation. Before target separation, the error correcting 
value of the theoretical trajectory is obtained by the 
theoretical trajectory correcting algorithm. In the phase of 
target separation, the theoretical trajectory of the target is 
corrected by the error correcting value firstly, and then the 
fuzzy clustering association algorithm is applied to calculate 
the similarity between the measuring data of the target from 
sensors and the corrected theoretical trajectory. The 
similarity helps to identify whether the measured data is 
from the real target or not. Experimental results show that 
the authenticity of the target can be determined effectively. 
The identified results can be used as the decision-making 
basis of the servo sub-system and TV trackers, which can 
improve the continuous tracking probability of the 
electro-optical tracking system in the target separation.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The measurement of target separation features is one 
of the important missions in the Missile Range to the 
electro-optical tracking system, which can provide the 
visual image, ballistic information and profile 
characteristics of the target through the optical sensors 
(usual TV and Infrared). However, the imaging features of 
the target are usually complicated in the phase of target 
separation. A single target often splits into multiple 
sub-targets, which greatly disturb the identification of the 
real target and easily lead to track the wrong target after 
target separation. So it is important to research how to 
track the real target steadily in target separation. 
In the electro-optical tracking system, the TV trackers 
and the servo sub-system are two important sub-systems 
to realize the target tracking. The TV trackers distinguish 
the target and calculate the miss-distances of the target for 
the servo sub-system, which employs the data to control 
the pedestal to track the target automatically. Three 
techniques commonly used in the TV trackers to 
distinguish the target: Edge, Centroid and Correlation 
identifYing algorithm. The edge identifYing algorithm can 
distinguish the edge point of the target along the setting 
edge direction. The centroid identifYing algorithm can 
calculates the centroid point of the target by the horizontal

and vertical coordinate data of the digitized video signal. 
The correlation identifYing algorithm uses a pattern 
matching technique in distinguishing the target from the 
cluttered background. Nevertheless, the actual application 
shows that there are many limitations for these algorithms 
to identifY the real target in target separation, and the 
continuous tracking probability is low. It is difficult to 
meet the tracking needs of increasingly complicated target. 
In modem Missile Range, the theoretical trajectory of 
the target is the significant information to the 
electro-optical tracking system, but it usually has great 
deviation from the real. In the paper, a new tracking 
method is presented to improve the tracking capability in 
target separation. Through the theoretical trajectory 
correcting algorithm, the corrected theoretical trajectory of 
target will close to the real trajectory, and it is used as the 
reference to judge whether the miss-distances of the target 
from the TV trackers are about the real target. The judging 
algorithm is based on the fuzzy clustering association rules, 
and the result is informed to the servo system and the TV 
trackers. According to the result, the servo system can 
avoid using the wrong miss-distances of the target, and the 
TV trackers can determine whether to identifY other 
targets again. So the probability of continuous tracking in 
target separation is improved effectively. 
II. PRINCIPLE OF TRACKING IN TARGET SEPARATION 
It is the premise of automatic tracking in the 
electro-optical tracking system that the TV trackers should 
recognize the real target and then generate their own 
miss-distances. One of the miss-distances is selected 
artificially in the servo sub-system by the operative button 
to close the loop and drive the tracking mount to keep the 
target positioned at the system line-of-sight. Before target 
separation, the target is high contrast to the background in 
the electro-optical sensors, and it is easy for the TV 
trackers to identifY the target by the three identifYing 
algorithms and calculate the corresponding miss-distances. 
The automatic tracking can be accomplished reliably in 
the servo sub-system by using the sole artificially selected 
miss-distance. However, in the phase of target separation, 
due to the existence of sub-targets, the TV trackers are 
difficult to distinguish the real target from the multiple 
sub-targets and the corresponding miss-distance may not 
be from the real target. If the servo sub-system still uses 
the previous selected miss-distance, it would fail tracking 
the real target. Figure I shows the case of an experimental 
target separation.

Actually, the theoretical trajectory of the target can be 
used by the electro-optical tracking system during the 
measuring of the target, but it is usually not precise 
because of all kinds of deviation in the target flight. Here a 
new technique is applied to improve the probability of 
successful tracking in the target separation. The theoretical 
trajectory is corrected firstly, and then is used to judge 
whether the miss-distances of the target from the TV 
trackers are similar to the real target. The tracking method 
in the phase of target separation is shown in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Block diagram of tracking in the target separation 
Before target separation, all the TV trackers identify 
the same target and generate the corresponding 
miss-distances. The target measuring position ?, can be 
obtained by synthesizing the miss-distance of target with 
the encoder of tracking system, and then the state x, (k) 
and covariance matrix ?(k) of the target in the sample 
time k can be estimated by Kalman filtering and 
predicting. Through the covariance weight fusion, the 
fusing state X' (k) and the fusing covariance matrix p' (k) 
of the target are formed, which can be treated as the real 
state of target. At the same time, the theoretical 
state X'(k) and theoretical covariance matrix P'(k) of the 
target can be deduced by Kalman filtering the theoretical 
trajectory data. Comparing the fusing state X'(k) with the 
theoretical state X'(k) , the state correcting value (J" and the 
corrected theoretical state X(k) can be acquired by 
theoretical trajectory correction algorithm. 
After target separation, the state estimation of 
target x, (k,) from various TV trackers may not reflect the 
state of the real target precisely, but the corrected 
theoretical state X(k,) would be high associated with the

can be counted by the fuzzy clustering association 
algorithm, which shows whether the state x, (k,) is similar 
to the corrected theoretical state X(k ) . If the state X (k ) is 
1 J 1 
similar to the corrected theoretical state x, (k,), it means 
the TV tracker i has the high probability to recognize the 
real target. On the contrary, the TV tracker i would 
recognize the wrong target. 
III. REALIZATION OF THEORETICAL TRAJECTORY 
CORRECTION 
The theoretical trajectory of target usually deviates 
from the real moving trajectory because of various 
disturbances in the target flight. Comparing numerous 
trajectory data, it can be found that the deviation between 
the theoretical target state and the real target state changes 
slowly, as shown in Figure 3. The theoretical target state 
corrected by the deviation is close to the real state in the 
short target separating time.

Assume that X"(k) is the theoretical state estimation 
in the sample time k, X'(k) is the fusion state estimation 
which approaches the real state before the target 
separating. Define the error coefficient as: 
p(k) = [X'(k) - X"(k)t W[X'(k) - X"(k)] 
Where w is the weight coefficient matrix. If the error 
coefficient is larger than the error threshold p, it indicates 
that the theoretical state estimation of target departs from 
the real state greatly and should be corrected. Define the 
error correction value as: 
cy = ;t[X'(k) - X"(k)] 
Where A is the correcting coefficient. Defme the 
corrected theoretical state of target after the time k as: 
X(k+m) = X"(k+m)+cy 
According to experimental trajectory in Figure 3, the 
error coefficient of different weight coefficient matrix w 
is calculated and shown in Figure 4. The error coefficient 
is smaller in the initial and end segment, which shows the 
theoretical state estimation close to the real state. It is 
consistent with the movement state relationship in Figure 
3, and this trend will not change with the change of the 
weight coefficient matrix w .

IV. REALIZATION OF FUZZY CLUSTERING 
ASSOCIA nON 
The fuzzy clustering algorithm works in the target 
separating. The similarity between the state estimation of 
target from TV trackers and the corrected theoretical state 
of target is counted to judge whether the TV trackers 
indentify the real target. Assume there are two state 
estimations of target from two different sensors: 
x, = [XI,X2,00·,x"t i=1,2 
The corresponding resolution is: 
D, = [61,6,,00·.6:f i=1,2 
Assume the accuracy of the sensor 1 is higher than that 
of sensor 2, then: 
DI(k) < D2(k) 'ltk=l, 2,00', n 
291 
The Euclidean distance between two states of target is 
defined as: 
d' = {"X, 
- XJ II i"* j 
'1 liD, II i =j 
According to the fuzzy means clustering algorithm, the 
optimum membership {uij} is determined as: 
U '1 'lti,j= 1,2 , d (?=

h=1 dhJ 
Where s is the total number of targets, m is an integer, 
u" is the resolution membership degree of sensor i (i=l, 2) , 
u" is the membership degree of the difference between the 
two states x, and xj' The global association is decided 
according to the minimum accuracy sensors, then: 
{I U12 > U22 
T= 0 U12 < u22 
When T= 1, it means two states of target are from the 
same target, whereas T=O means two states of target are 
from different targets. 
V. EXPERIMENTS VERIFICATION AND RESULTS 
ANALYSIS 
In order to verifY the algorithms, we assume there are 
two sensors (sensor 1 and sensor 2) in the electro-optical 
tracking system. According to the experimental trajectory 
in Figure 3, it is assumed that the real measured data is 
from sensor 1. Data from the sensor 2 is simulated by 
adding a slope signal B(t) = (t-15)*I(t-15) to the 
real measured data after the time ISs, which analog the 
sensor 2 identifies a wrong target in target separation. The

the time k = 15 s , the error coefficient is calculated

correction is calculated with (Y = [10.3044, 0.8099( . The

For the sensor 1, the state estimation of target and the 
corrected theoretical state of target are correlated in the 
time k = 15-19 s, which suggests that there is a large 
probability to identifY the real target for the sensor 1 in 
target separation, and the tracking system has a reason to 
choose the data from the sensor 1 for tracking. For the 
sensor 2, the state estimation of target and the corrected 
theoretical state of target are not correlated from the 
time k = 16 s , which means there is a greater probability of 
tracking a false target for the sensor 2. The results suit to 
the above hypothesis.
