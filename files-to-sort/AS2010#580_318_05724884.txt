Abstract— A common problem in any large grocery store is to 
make sure the customers find the right product of their choice 
quickly. The problem gets worse when large grocery stores 
hold several thousand products and when customers have time 
constraints; it becomes way too difficult for customers to find 
the required product quickly. Often customers end up not 
purchasing the product of their preference just because it is 
difficult to find and consequently this may directly impact the 
customer satisfaction of the store. We present a Radio 
Frequency Identification (RFID) enabled cell phone, which is a 
hybrid system that integrates the RFID technology with case-
based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) for 
suggesting the preferred products to customers and achieve 
customer satisfaction. Our proposed system analyses the 
customers’ purchase strategies to predict the consumer 
behavior and provide smart customer service.

I. INTRODUCTION
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is poised to 
become one of the fastest growing wireless technologies this 
decade, with estimates of millions of RFID tags and readers
connected on a global scale [1]. It offers great potential 
benefits in object identification and tracking in diverse 
application areas such as access control and security, asset 
and event management, supply chain and manufacturing, 
health care, environment, oil and gas exploration, 
pharmaceutical industries and consumer applications.  
Figure 1 shows a typical RFID system. There are two 
main components in the system, namely, RFID tags and 
RFID readers. An RFID tag is a tiny integrated circuit 
equipped with an antenna. In the presence of an RFID 
reader, the tag data (Electronic Product Code or EPC) is 
transferred to the reader. Additionally, in the RFID system, 
the reader connects to a middleware, which is responsible 
for converting raw tag data into meaningful information. It 
is also responsible for resolving reader collisions and for 
ensuring that multiple reads or bad reads are eliminated. The 
middleware connects to a back-end enterprise system
software that utilizes and processes the information 
retrieved from the tags. 
RFID technology is currently witnessing tremendous 
growth. IDTechEx estimates that the global RFID market 
will hit an annual investment of $5.29 billion, with IBM 
alone investing $250 million in the technology [2,3]. Over 
10,000 RFID pilot projects are currently underway 
worldwide. Many countries are piloting the use of RFID in 
waste management, environment, supply chain management 
and airport logistics. Yet, things have barely started. The 
RFID market is estimated to grow to about $18 billion by 
2013 and to $26 billion by 2018 [2, 3, 4]. 
Figure 1: RFID System 
EPCGlobal [5], a governing body for RFID standards 
worldwide is currently responsible for proposing standards 
for EPC to support RFID applications. EPCGlobal has 
envisioned an architecture called the Internet of Things in 
which devices with RFID tags dispersed through the 
Internet can communicate with each other, providing real-
time information about their location, contents, destination 
and ambient conditions. The basic components of the 
architecture are shown in Figure 2. The RFID reader 
captures tag and sensor information through the air interface 
and passes it onto the RFID middleware through the reader 
protocol.  The middleware is responsible for data smoothing, 
reader coordination, data forwarding, storage and task 
management. Application level events for a particular EPC 
or a set of EPCs are activated by the middleware. These are 
transferred in a secure manner to networked databases.  In 
order to link a given EPC to the object’s database anywhere 
on the Internet, the architecture consists of the Object 
Naming Service (ONS), Discovery Services Protocols, and 
EPC Info Services. ONS is similar to DNS (Domain Name 
Service) for the traditional Internet. It essentially provides 
the URL for a given EPC. The architecture also proposes the 
use of PML (Physical Markup Language) to represent and 
translate static and dynamic data about the object (such as

date, time, volume, expiry, etc.) and also to develop 
programs to describe the behavior of the object.

Things
II. MOTIVATION
One of the biggest potential applications for the use of 
RFID is in consumer businesses. It is now becoming 
increasingly possible to integrate RFID readers into cell 
phones. Nokia unveiled the world’s first cell phone with 
RFID reader in 2004 [6], followed by NTT DoCoMo. Many 
other cell phone manufacturers are looking at different 
application possibilities to target the consumer industry. Bae 
and Kim [8] describe models for consumer purchase 
behavior prediction. The first step in the prediction model is 
sampling. The data obtained is classified into different 
categories that are derived based on the black box model 
proposed by Sandhusen [7]. Liping et al propose a customer 
service management system [10] which integrates case-based 
reasoning and rule-based reasoning. Their proposed system 
classifies potential customers in direct marketing. Their 
results prove that mining of the unstructured customer 
purchase information which has both quantitative and 
qualitative information can be very useful in identifying 
customer purchase behavior. Similarly, Golding and 
Rosenbloom present a unique architecture [11] for improving 
rule-based systems through case based reasoning. The 
central idea of their system is to use a set of rules to any 
given problem to obtain a default solution. 
We propose a novel RFID system for use by consumer 
businesses in the retail sector. A common problem in any 
large grocery store is to make sure the customers find the 
right product of their choice quickly. The problem gets worse 
when large grocery stores hold several thousand products 
and when customers have time constraints; it becomes way 
too difficult for customers to find the required product 
quickly. Often customers end up not purchasing the product 
of their preference just because it is difficult to find and 
consequently this may directly impact the customer 
satisfaction of the store. It is also important to warn 
customers about product information relating to any allergies 
that they may have. Our proposed system analyses the 
customers’ purchase strategies to predict the consumer 
behavior and provide smart customer service. Our proposal 
uses an RFID-enabled cell phone, which is a hybrid system 
that integrates the RFID technology with case-based 
reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) for 
suggesting the preferred products to customers and achieve 
customer satisfaction.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section III 
describes the design of the proposed system. Section IV 
gives an overview of the implementation. Section V provides 
concluding remarks. 
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM
Our system is an application-software running on a 
mobile device such as a cell phone, blackberry, etc. In order 
to access this application, the customer has to set up a user 
account and enter his/her personal information like name, 
age, gender, marital status, profession, and any allergy 
information. Each customer will be given an ID (Cust_ID), 
which is mapped to their name. The collected customer 
information is stored in a common table called Customer 
Table–1, which is used for identifying and categorizing the 
customers (Table 1). 
Table 1. Customer Table -1 
The intelligent system uses the customer’s profile to 
categorize the customer. Here, we identify each category 
based on at least one or more unique features. This 
uniqueness is achieved by considering the age range, gender, 
marital or family status (single, couple, family of 3, family 4 
or more), and professional status (high school student, 
college or university student, professional, full-time

employee, unemployed, homemaker).  For example, a male 
student, who is single and with an age range 18 to 23, will 
have a category ID of CC12. A female student, who is single 
and with the same age range will have a category ID of 
CC13, at the same time, a female in the same age range who 
is single but with an Engineering profession will have a 
different category ID of CC14. Allergy information is stored 
to make sure the suggested product is safe for the customer. 
These features will define the buyers’ characteristics 
represented in the black box model proposed by Sandhusen 
[7].
Our proposed system acts like a customer service staff, 
which understands the customers’ purchase behavior and 
suggest the appropriate products. The customer purchase 
behavior is understood by the optimal use of customers’ 
previous purchase patterns and by dynamically updating the 
set of rules for each customer and also for each customer 
category. For this purpose, we store and retrieve all the 
customers’ purchase history in the Transaction Table (Table 
2).
Table 2. Transaction Table 
A. Transaction Table 
The transaction table acts as the source case table, which 
stores all the transactions. The customer transaction table 
consists of information like date at which the product is 
purchased, ID of the customer who purchased the product 
and Product ID of the purchased product and the Product 
Category. The product ID and the product category are 
mapped to a Product Table (Table 3) that stores the entire 
information about that specific product.  
B. Product Table 
The product table stores information like product ID, 
product category, brand name, price value, quantity value, 
location of the product, and allergy information. Here we 
consider the price as Price_tag, which defines if the price of 
that particular branded product is low (L), medium (M) or 
high (H), when compared to the list of the products which 
fall under the same category. The quantity is Quantity_tag, 
which denotes whether the preferred quantity of that product 
category is small (S), medium (M) or large (L); when 
compared to the list of products which falls under the same 
category. For example, if a customer’s next preferred product 
is Milk of quantity value M (Medium) and price value H 
(High), then the query searches the database for the list of 
products that match Pro_Cat = Milk and Price_tag = H and 
Quant_tag = M and it displays to a maximum of two 
products which has the highest weights. 
Table 3. Product Table 
C. Weight Calculation 
Weights are updated at the end of every transaction.  The 
weights of the next product category that are picked are 
calculated based on the following formula:  
P[i+1] = Pi + ((P(s,f) * Pmax) - Pi)/Pn   (1) 
• Pi : Previous or current weight of the product  
P[i+1]:  New weight 
• P(s,f) : Probability of success or failure (1,0)
Pmax: Maximum weight = 100 
Pn : Total choices of next product 
P(s,f) is equal to 1 for success and 0 for failure. Every time 
when a customer picks one product category from the next 
products category list, the weight of that product increases 
and the weights of the rest of the product decreases when 
applying the above equation.  
The price and quantity evaluation is done using the same 
weighting function. Every time a customer picks a product of 
particular quantity or price, the weight of that quantity or 
price tag will increase and the rest will decrease when 
applying the above formula. 
D. Customer Table-2 
This table (Table 4) stores all the information to support 
the rule based reasoning. This table stores the primary rules 
for all the customers for all the products in the store. These 
rules are generated from the cases. In the example shown in 
Table 4, if the customer with ID=9000101, who belongs to 
the customer category CC12, picks a product category P1, 
then next preferred product category of highest weight is P24 
and of second highest weight is P27 with a Price value of 
Medium (M) and quantity value of Large (L). 
541
Table 4. Customer Table-2 
In order to suggest products to the customer we need to 
update the rules (Customer Table -2) dynamically to make 
the search process faster and easier. To achieve dynamic 
update, we have unique tables Customer Table–3 (to identify 
the next two preferred products based on weights), Price 
Evaluation Table (for price weight evaluation), and Quantity 
Evaluation Table (for quantity weight evaluation). 
Table 5: Customer Table-3 
E. Customer Table-3 
In this table (Table 5), we denote the product category as 
P1, P2, P3, etc. for the sake of simplicity (example: P1 - 
Milk, P2 - Beverage, P3 - Sauce, etc.). In order to identify 
the next two preferred products based on the current picked 
product, we search the pervious purchase history, which will 
contain the total number of times a product P2, P3, etc. is 
picked after Product P1. Next_Pro1 stores the next preferred 
product which has the maximum weight (i.e. the product 
which is picked the most number of times after the current 
product). Next_Pro2 stores the second next preferred product 
which has the second maximum weight (i.e. the product 
which is picked the second most after the current product). 
The value of Next_Pro1 and Next_Pro2 will be dynamically 
updated in the Customer Table-2 based on the values in the 
Customer Table-3.
In order to calculate the weights for price and quantity for 
each product category we use price evaluation and quantity 
evaluation table. 
Table 6. Price evaluation Table 
Price Evaluation table (Table 6)  stores the information of 
each product categories’ price weights for all the customers. 
The weights are calculated using the weighting function 
mentioned before. The price value with the maximum weight 
for each category will be updated dynamically in the 
Customer Table-2. 
Table 7. Quantity evaluation Table 
Quantity evaluation table stores the information of each 
product categories’ quantity weights for all the customers. 
The weights are calculated similar to the quantity evaluation 
technique and is increased or decreased based on the number 
of times that particular item is purchased or rejected. The 
quantity value with the maximum weight for each category 
will be updated dynamically in the Customer Table-2. 
In summary, the system initially searches for the next 
preferred product based on the customer personal 
preferences and personal purchase history, if a match is not 
542
found, then it search the database for other customers’ 
purchase history who fall under the same customer category 
of this customer. Still if there no matches are found, then we 
apply general association rules to identity the next preferred 
product. This is described in the following sub-section. 
F. Association Rules 
In a situation, when the system cannot find similar cases 
for the customer then the recommendation is done by using 
association rules.  Association rule mining finds interesting 
associations and correlation relationships among large sets of 
data items. Association rule mining is widely used in market 
based analysis. The data obtained can be used for cross 
selling, store layouts, etc. An association rule typically is of 
the form A  B where A is an item set and B is an item set 
that contains only a single atomic condition. According to 
Bae and Kim [8]: “The support of an association rule is the 
percentage of records containing item sets A and B together. 
The confidence of a rule is the percentage of records 
containing item set A that also contain item set B”. Support 
here indicates the usefulness of the discovered rules and the 
confidence is the certainty of the detected association rule.  
Table 8. Association Representation 
Transaction ID  Products 
TS00001 Bread, Butter, Milk  
TS00002 Bread, Cheese, Eggs
TS00003 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs  
TS00004 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs  
TS00005 Milk, Butter, Eggs, Yogurt  
TS00006 Bread, Cheese, Milk, Eggs,  
Peanut Butter
Association rule mining technique finds all collections of 
items in a database whose confidence and support meet or 
exceed pre-specified threshold values. For example, Table 8 
shows the results of association mining on products that 
included milk and bread. Zhang et al [9] propose a modified 
apriori algorithm for the mining of association rules. The 
authors use actual sales data to test the feasibility of the 
algorithm. For our system we intend to extract the 
transaction information from the transaction table and feed 
the data into the modified apriori algorithm [9] in order to 
extract the association rules. 
G. Features of the Proposed System 
Figure 3 shows the summary flowchart of the proposed 
system.  
1. Detect the current product picked and display the next 
product that the customer wishes to purchase. 
2. Display the location (aisle) of the suggested product, 
its price and quantity. 
3. Display warnings if the customer is allergic to certain 
products, based on the information provided by the customer 
on his/her profile and the product’s ingredient information. 
Figure 3: Summary Flowchart
Figure 4: Typical Display on the Cell phone 
As an example, Figure 4 shows that the first product 
picked by the customer is Bread, and the system suggests 
543
two next preferred products (Milk and Eggs). The customer 
decides to purchase the Milk. However, the customer decides 
to pick Rice, instead of the suggested Eggs. The system 
automatically identifies the next preferred product after Rice 
and gives the right suggestion at the same time it updates the 
database with this new case for future recommendations. 
IV. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Figure 5 is the block diagram which explains the system 
architecture. There are three major components in the 
system. The RFID tagged consumer product, RFID reader 
enabled mobile device and the backend enterprise system. 
The backend enterprise system consists of the Intelligent 
System and the Database.  In a regular scenario, the 
customer walks into the store with his RFID reader enabled 
cell phone; he picks a product from the aisle and scans it. 
The RFID reader sends the tag information along with the 
consumer information to the backend enterprise system for 
processing. The Backend enterprise system which, consists 
of two parts,
(i) Intelligent system: Applies the rule-based and case-based 
reasoning to identify the preferred product. 
(ii) Database: Stores the user profile information and the 
case base (previous purchase history) for search and 
processing.
Figure 5: Block Diagram of System Implementation 
An RFID reader can be embedded in the mobile device 
like cell phone, iPhone or blackberry. The data sent by the 
reader is modulated and backscattered from a number of 
tags. Passive RFID tags are cost effective and they harvest 
energy from the reader’s communication signal to power up 
their operation and communication with the reader. The 
RFID reader has the capability of reading several products 
within a few seconds. In a typical supermarket all the 
products are stored in clusters, if the customer takes the 
RFID reader enabled cell phone near the aisle, it might read 
most of the products in the aisle which are in close 
proximity. This might be a problem in our application 
because we would like the reader to read just the product 
picked by the customer in order to recommend the next 
preferred product. One way to overcome this limitation is to 
have the user to place the RFID reader enabled cell phone in 
the shopping cart and have the read range of the RFID 
reader limited to 10 to 15 cm. Then the customer can scan 
the product using the RFID enabled cell phone. 
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have proposed the design and implementation of an 
RFID-based system for use by consumer businesses in the 
retail industry. Our system is able to quickly suggest 
products to customers based on their preferences using rule-
based and case-based reasoning. 
We believe the proposed technique will be more 
effective if it is store specific, since each store has a unique 
set of products and unique placement of products in the 
aisles. Having a store specific approach will also help the 
business to manage and protect their customer purchase 
history. The proposed technique can be extended for 
applications like the library system, pharmaceuticals, air and 
rail ticket booking system, etc., where the customer will 
have regular and similar purchase behaviors. The intelligent 
system will be more effective if we have more customer 
purchase information, which will help us to clearly 
understand and get accurate weights for the behaviors. Since 
RFID technology is still in early implementation stages, we 
need to consider security issues and traffic congestion issues 
before implementing it. We would like to test the data to 
find the accuracy level in each metric like price, quantity 
and order choice. We are also looking for more hybrid 
techniques to identify similarity of the patterns in the long-
term purchase behavior and short-term purchase behavior 
and also to identify any change in the purchase behavior 
based on seasons or other social aspects.
