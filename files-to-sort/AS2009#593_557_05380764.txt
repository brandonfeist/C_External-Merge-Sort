Abstract  
Text clustering is an automatic technique to group 
texts using the approach of feature extraction and 
term connection to calculate the similarities among 
subject contents of texts. Since the properties of terms 
in Chinese text (e.g. segmentation and annotation) 
are not as clear as the other languages, extracting 
and distinguishing features from Chinese text is 
therefore much more difficult, which greatly impacts 
the effects of clustering. From the perspective of 
military news, this paper applies both quantitative 
association rule and hierarchical agglomerative 
algorithm to cluster Chinese news published in Youth 
Daily News, and the application results are 
compared with those by the traditional vector space 
model approach and by the general association rule 
approach, respectively. F-measure is used as 
evaluation metric in the experiments. Experimental 
results show that the quantitative association rule 
approach performs more accurately than both the 
vector space model and association rule in text 
automatic clustering.       
Keywords: Vector space model; Association rule; 
Quantitative association rule; Hierarchical 
agglomerative clustering.  
 
1. Introduction 
Data mining is generally used to mine information 
from a structured data, such as a transaction database, 
rather than from an unstructured data, such as a 
document, webpage, and so on. The emerging field of 
text mining uses method from data mining to extract 
interesting information and knowledge. In general, 
the process of text mining includes: domain selection, 
text preprocessing, mining analysis, and result 
visualization. Domain selection is the step to collect 
and arrange plenty of text data in a specific subject 
domain. In the step of text preprocessing, terms in a 
document are divided or combined based on the 
relevant rules, and the key-terms being able to 
represent the characteristic of text is selected. By the 
rules of appearance frequency, co-occurrence, or 
cluster, mining analysis is performed to construct the 
relationship among word structures. In the result 
visualization step, the correlated results are exhibited 
through graphic tools.  
Traditional text clustering often adopts the vector 
space model (VSM) approach to express text data. By 
this approach, Lee et al. showed that there are two 
drawbacks in clustering results [10]. Firstly, since the 
relationships between terms in text can not be 
identified, the clustering of text is misjudged. 
Secondly, high dimension of terms will easily induce 
the problem of inaccurate clustering. Therefore, Lee 
et al. [10] proposed a two-stage document-clustering 
method based on association rule mining to 
investigate the text cluster problem for the document 
in English.  
However, traditional association rule (AR) 
approach practically only considers if a term appears 
in the document, but the occurrence quantity of term 
is ignored, which can not reflect the actual 
connection between terms. Fabrizio et al. [6] argued 
if the quantity is took into account during the AR 
mining process, more hidden connections among 
rules and more multiple relationships among items 
may be discovered to be applied on other different 
practices. Since the factor of quantity is not currently 
considered in the application of association rules on 
text mining, this paper adopts the qualitative 
association rule (QAR) approach, which adds the 
occurrence frequency of term in every document into 
the items to mine rules, to increase the connections 
among words, to reduce the noises resulting from 
misjudgment, and to enhance the quality of clustering 
for documents in Chinese.                            
 
2. Literature review 
2.1 On-line News 
With the rapid development of information 
technology and the increment and generalization of 
network user community, the news website not only

2009 International onference on sian anguage Processing
presents news events but also provides some 
functions of news categorization and 
recommendation to satisfy the users’ requirements on 
querying information from news. For instance, in 
Google News, news events can be automatically 
classified, and users can select their own country 
languages as well as recommend some specific news; 
in Yahoo News, except for the functions of news 
classification, the functions of photo news and 
popular recommendation are also included. 
Chen et al. [3] selected Google News as sample 
sources to propose an automatic method for 
constructing news knowledge ontology, and this 
method then was applied on automatic query 
expansion of news search engine to resolve the issues 
of uneasily selecting a good query term for users. For 
the news on both CNN and Reuter’s websites, 
Perelomov et al. [12] proposed a self-organizing map 
(SOM) based approach to construct a news subject 
map. By selecting on-line news as sources, Ong et al. 
[11] applied natural language processing (NLP) 
technique to automatically extract terms in the news, 
and constructed a hierarchical news map.  
However, the literatures above investigated the 
on-line news in general scopes, but the news in a 
specific domain, particularly in military domain, had 
not been explored.  
2.2 Quantitative Association Rules 
Data mining is attempted to discover the useful 
hidden information from plenty of data. The main 
techniques in data mining involve classification, 
cluster, sequential patterns, AR, and decision tree, etc. 
Han [8] depicted that the technique being most often 
used is the association rule, which uses both support 
and confidence parameters to find out the 
connections among item sets. Traditional AR is based 
on the Apriori algorithm to analyze the item sets in 
transaction database. Recently, many Apriori 
algorithm based association rules have been proposed 
[4, 7, 9]. 
However, traditional association rules merely 
consider if the item appears in transaction database, 
but the quantity of item bought is neglected. In 
practice, both the item and its quantity are recorded in 
transaction data [2]. In QAR mining, the different 
corresponding membership methods are adopted to 
partition the intervals for the item with different 
quantity in order to mine more and more potential 
useful association rules. The quantitative partition 
algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. 
2.3 Cluster analysis 
Clustering means the automatic assignment of a 
set of data into some subsets in which the data with 
higher similarity in some senses are automatically 
grouped. The objective of cluster analysis is to 
discover the clustering results and infer some useful, 
hidden, and interested features and phenomenon 
through analyzing the similarity degree among data. 
Hierarchical clustering utilizes the agglomerative or 
divisive method to merge those smaller clusters with 
higher degree of similarity among them into the 
larger clusters, or according to the requirements of 
users, to split the larger clusters to generate different 
number of clusters. The hierarchical agglomerative 
clustering (HAC) algorithm is a bottom up approach 
to merge all the data points.  
In the HAC algorithm, there are four methods to 
define the distance between clusters: single-linkage, 
complete-linkage, average-linkage (AL), and Ward’s 
method. Chuang and Chien [5] revealed that the 
clustering results of average-linkage are the best 
among four methods. Thus, this paper adopts the AL 
method to calculate the distance between documents.  
 
Step1: Let {<i,q1>,<i,q2>,<i,q3>…<i,qn>} be the set of 
q_items in DB which have the same item i. And q1< 
q2< q3…< qn.  
Step2: Assume that c1,c2,c3…,and cn are the numbers of 
transactions containing <i,q1>,<i,q2>,<i,q3>…,and 
<i,qn>, respectively. 
Step3: Let T be the total number of transactions. 
Step4: First, we find a minimum integer k such that is 
greater than or equal to the lower support threshold, 
e, say S1, and generate the interval [q1…qk]. 
Step5: Then, find a minimum integer k2(k2>k1) such 
that

3. Research Design 
The research design of this paper is divided into 
five stages: data collection, term preprocessing, term 
correlation, cluster analysis, and result evaluation. In 
data collection stage, this paper is mainly focused on 
military news documents. During the stage of term 
preprocessing, the keywords being representative of 
document are extracted to form a thesaurus. This 
stage involves the steps of Chinese term segment 
processing, N-Gram based term selection, meaning 
196
consistency, and weight calculation of term. In term 
correlation stage, VSM, AR, and QAR approaches 
are applied to mine terms, and matrix of document 
vector, association matrix of terms, and association 
matrix of quantitative terms are established, 
respectively. For cluster analysis stage, traditional 
VSM approach uses the cosine theorem to calculate 
the similarity degree between documents, and 
collocates with the HAC algorithm to cluster together 
the documents; whereas both AR and QAR 
approaches use two-staged document cluster 
framework to execute cluster analysis. In the 
framework, the terms are first automatically clustered, 
and then the score of document in each term cluster is 
calculated to classify the document into the specific 
term cluster with higher score. In the result 
evaluation stage, precision, recall, and F-measure are 
selected as evaluation metrics to analyze the cluster 
results. Fig. 2 presents the research flowchart of this 
paper.

3.1 Data Collections 
This paper is attempted to explore the effects of 
text clustering on on-line military news. News 
published in Youth Daily News [13] , which is issued 
by Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan, R.O.C., 
from June 2008 to February 2009 are collected as 
sample sources. Thus, 1026 news are acquired, and 
they can be divided into 14 categories in Chinese as 
shown in Table 1. 
 
3.2 Text Processing 
(1) Extraction and label of Chinese words 
The Chinese automatic phrase segment system, 
CKIP (Chinese Knowledge and Information 
Processing) developed by Academia Sinica, is 
adopted in the paper to segment term for documents 
in Chinese.  
(2) Selection of word characteristics 
In this paper, three categories of word 
characteristics, including noun (3 subcategories), 
verb (15 subcategories), and non-adjective (1 
subcategories), are used to merge the word 
characteristics together for extracting the meaningful 
terms.  
 
Table 1. Quantity of news collections 
No. Category Quantity 
1 ????(Military justice and discipline) 101 
2 ????(Taiwan-China relations) 223 
3 ????(Reserves and Mobilization) 52 
4 ????(Force training) 105 
5 ????(Information security) 66 
6 ????(Veterans service) 102 
7 ????(All-out defense) 58

12 ????(Sino-U.S. relations) 60 
13 ????(Sino-Japanese relations) 34 
14 ????(Energy saving & carbon reduction) 52 
 Total 1026 
 
(3) N-Gram based term selection 
Since the word segmented by CKIP belongs to an 
element with fundamental unit, this paper applies the 
N-Gram based term selection approach to merge the 
words so that the terms extracted out are more 
meaningful. Firstly, the contents of document are 
separated by 2-Gram or 3-Gram word combination. If 
the word frequency of co-occurrence for the 
segments of paired words or three sets of words is 
higher than a specific threshold, those segments are 
merged as an independent term. By the N-Gram 
based term selection approach, the terms with more 
completed meaning can be segmented, and the terms 
with recently fresh and popular meaning, such as 
those terms ’??? (milk scandal)’, ‘????
(flexible diplomacy)’, and ‘????(charter flights 
between Taiwan and China)’, can be discovered. 
Those terms used in the documents of professional 
domain, for example, ‘????(physical isolation)’, 
and ‘????(postal service cooperation)’, can also 
197
be correctly segmented. Therefore, the terms selected 
in this approach have higher connections.           
(4) Integration and modification of terms  
The guidelines of integrating and modifying terms 
are set as follows.  
Rule 1: If the terms with same meaning are 
represented in different combination of 
words, then the term with higher occurrence 
frequency is selected as the term to be 
analyzed. For example, although ‘????’, 
‘??’, ‘??’, and ‘???????’ are 
used to stand for the Mainland China, ‘??’ 
is selected as term to replace the others by 
this rule. 
Rule 2: Term both in Chinese and English is unified. 
For instance, MOU, CECA, and WHO are 
used to represent ‘???????’, ‘??
???????’, and ‘?????? , 
respectively. By this rule, the abbreviation in 
English is chosen to stand for the term in 
Chinese. 
Rule 3: If some nouns are too common and are 
weakly connected to news, such as ‘???
? (wish)’, ‘ ? ? (future)’, ‘ ? ?
(implementation)’, and ‘??(direct)’, they 
will be deleted.  
 
3.3 Experimental Design 
The experiments are designed to analyze and 
compare the automatic clustering results by the 
approaches of VSM, AR, and QAR. In experiment A, 
for the document vector matrix generated by VSM, 
the HAC algorithm is applied to conduct the text 
automatic clustering. Traditional AR and QAR 
approaches are performed in experiments B and C, 
respectively. In these two approaches, two-stage 
method is implemented to execute the automatic 
clustering. On the first stage, the HAC algorithm is 
used to carry out the automatic clustering on terms. 
On the second stage, a comparative function [10] is 
designed to calculate what the matching score of each 
document is in each term cluster produced on the first 
stage. If a document scores the highest score in a 
specific term cluster, the document is classified into 
this cluster. The experimental design is described as 
follows.                 
(1). Experiment A (VSM method) 
Step 1: Assign every news event as a vector in space. 
Then, transfer the documents in all the sets to 
a vector space matrix. 
Step 2: Use the cosine theorem to calculate the 
similarity degree between two documents. Let 
1D
K
and 2D
K
denote the vector representative 
forms of the document 1D and 2D , 
respectively. The formula of the similarity 
degree between documents 1D and 2D is 
expressed as:     
      
( )
21
21
21,cos
DD
DDDD
×
×
=
                 (1) 
Step 3: Establish the vector matrix of similarity 
degree for the document.   
Step 4: Apply the HAC algorithm on the document to 
execute automatic clustering, and generate 
the results of text automatic clustering.   
(2). Experiment B (AR method) 
Step 1: Apply AR approach to mine the term. Then, 
assign the average confidence of term as the 
similarity degree, and establish the term 
matrix. 
Step 2: Apply the HAC algorithm on the term to 
execute clustering, and generate the results 
of term automatic clustering. 
Step 3: Use the comparative function to calculate 
what the matching score of each document is 
in each term cluster. If a document scores 
the highest score in a specific term cluster, 
the document is classified into this cluster. 
(3). Experiment C (QAR method) 
All the steps are the same as those in experiment 
B except that the QAR approach replaces the AR 
approach in Step 1.  
 
3.4 Evaluation metrics 
Since Precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure 
are usually used to evaluate the performance of 
information retrieval, this paper also uses these three 
performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy of text 
clustering. Let Nt and Nc be the classification results 
by man-made and automatic clustering, respectively. 
Then, the formulas for P, R, and F-measure are 
defined as follows.

4. Result analysis 
The accuracy evaluation results of experiments A, 
B, and C are listed in Table 2, which shows that all 
three performance metrics of VSM approach are the 
worst when compared with those of AR and QAR. 
The reason is each term is considered to be an 
independent state in the VSM approach. 
 
Table 2: Accuracy evaluation results 
 VSM AR QAR 
Precision 0.548 0.701 0.740 
Recall 0.420 0.669 0.694 
F-measure 0.453 0.681 0.714 
 
In the AR approach, the relationship between 
terms is emphasized, so that the term rules mined by 
data mining technique have higher connection degree, 
which improves the shortcoming of low connection 
degree by VSM approach. Compared with the VSM 
approach, the AR approach increases 0.228 in the 
F-measure metrics.  
In the QAR approach, the concept of quantity is 
taking into account in the word, which further 
emphasizes the relationship between terms. Since the 
terms with same meaning but with different quantity 
may have different connection degree with the other 
terms, the terms with different quantity are divided 
into some divisions. This procedure can more 
accurately mine the connection between terms. 
Accordingly, the QAR approach increases 0.261 in 
the F-measure metrics when compared with the VSM 
approach. Furthermore, the performance comparisons 
between the AR and the QAR approaches reveal that 
the latter approach is 0.033 better than the former 
approach in each of precision, recall, and F-measure 
metrics. Therefore, applying the QAR approach can 
obtain the more accurate mining results and the better 
automatic clustering effects.  
Additionally, Table 3 exhibits the effects of 
automatic clustering on each category of news 
sample sources described in section 3.1 by applying 
the VSM, AR, and QAR approaches.  
For the F-measure metric, the effects of automatic 
clustering resulting from both the AR and QAR 
approaches are better than those resulting from the 
VSM approach. Moreover, Table 3 also shows that 
the QAR approach performs the best on 11 categories, 
and the AR approach performs the best on 3 
categories.  
The comparisons of F-measure metric on each 
category among three approaches are represented in 
Fig. 3. In general, the QAR approach performs better 
than the AR and VSM approach.

5. Conclusion 
This paper applies both AR and QAR approaches 
to extract the terms with high connection, and 
integrates with the HAC algorithm to execute the 
automatic clustering on on-line Chinese military 
news documents. The accuracies of automatic 
clustering among the VSM, AR and QAR approaches 
are compared. Experimental results show that the 
F-measure metric of applying traditional VSM 
approach on automatic clustering is 0.453, the 
application of AR approach can increase the 
F-measure metric to 0.681, and finally the application 
of QAR approach can further enhance the F-measure 
metric to 0.714. Consequently, for the issue of 
Chinese document automatic clustering, this paper 
proposes an integrated approach of combining the 
199
QAR with the HAC algorithm to improve the quality 
of text automatic clustering. From the experimental 
results, it is concluded that the proposed integrated 
approach can effectively enhance the quality of text 
automatic clustering, and can obtain the more 
accurate effects of automatic clustering. 
Because the news sample sources are collected 
from the military news published in Youth Daily 
News during the period between June 2008 and 
February 2009 and are reported from the stand point 
of military, the more sample sources should be 
expanded to the news from other newspapers and 
during the longer time periods and be from the other 
reporting perspectives in the future. Furthermore, for 
the future research direction, the concept of semantic 
analysis can be taking into account to more clearly 
present the connection between terms for the 
objective of improving the effects of automatic 
clustering.
