I.  INTRODUCTION  
Residents travel survey is an important work of OD 
survey in transport planning. It is a kind of basic information 
which must be collected in transport planning. As a basis of 
traffic demand forecasting and traffic plan establishment, it 
is also used to optimize existing urban public transit network 
and establish a project. In sum, it plays an important role in 
urban integrative and special transport planning.   
Sample rate of residents travel OD survey usually 
arranges from 3% to 5%, but it is always different in zones 
due to some factors which can’t be controlled, and the data 
of this survey are also with particularities. On the basis of 
data mining technology, using a small quantity of sample 
data to reckon the characteristics which present general rules 
can actualize. The information will be formed by analyzing 
the data of residents travel survey, discovering the relations 
and then giving them certain signification and association. 
The information provides something significant of data, but 
it is often unrelated to decision-making and can’t be consider 
as the basis. The more useful information, what is called 
knowledge, can be obtained only by further analysis.   
The ability to make use of such knowledge has become 
the key factor to successful decision-making. Using data 
mining technology, people can recognize the potential value 
of existing data and find some valuable information hidden 
in the data [1]. Therefore, data mining technology has been 
widely concerned and become the forefront of research 
directions in the field of database and information decision-
making. Association rules mining can discovery the 
association or relations among the items in a large quantity 
of data. It is an important issue in data mining and has been 
extensively studied in recent years. 
This paper used the data of residents travel survey in 
Fuzhou as a data set. After the pre-processing, the relativity 
of residents’ travel mode choice characteristics and 
influencing factors were found by using association rules 
algorithm. As a result, some meaningful rules were found, 
which can guide the formulation of transport policy. 
II. ASSOCIATION RULES AND APRIORI 
ALGORITHM 
Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman or Times 
New Roman may be used. If neither is available on your 
word processor, please use the font closest in appearance to 
Times. Avoid using bit-mapped fonts if possible. True-Type 
1 or Open Type fonts are preferred. Please embed symbol 
fonts, as well, for math, etc. 
Data association is a kind of knowledge in database 
which can be discovered. The certain regularity between 
values of two or more variables is called association. It can 
be divided into simple association, temporal association and 
causal association. The purpose of association analysis is to 
identify the association network hidden in the database[2][3]. 
A.  Basic Concepts 
Suppose I={ 1i , 2i ,…, mi } is data item set, D is the set 
of total exchange T, and DT ? .  
Association rules mining is to find dependence relations 
which fulfill the qualifications from the transaction database 
D. The terms of every record in D are items, and the object 
of association rules mining is the rule among items such as 
YX ? ?support=s%?confidence=c%. 
Some important indexes of association rules are given as 
follows: 
•  Support: the support of rule ???in transaction 
set D is the ratio of the number of transactions 
including ?  and ?  to the number of total 
transactions, which is represented by support(??
? ), i.e. support 
( { } DDTTYXTYX /,: ???=? ). 
• Confidence: the confidence of rule ? ? ? in 
transaction set D is the ratio of the number of 
transactions including ? and ? to the number of 
transactions including X, which is represented by 
confidence(??? ), i.e. confidence (??? )= 
{ } { }DTTXTDTTYXT ????? ,:/,:
. 
• Expected confidence: it describes the support of data 
item set Y without influence of data item set X,

which is represented by E- confidence (?), i.e.?- 
confidence (?)= { } DDTTYT /,: ?? . 
• Lift: lift is the ratio of confidence to expected 
confidence. It describes the influence of data item set 
X on data item set Y, which is represented by lift (?
??), i.e. lift (???)=confidence (???)/ E- 
confidence (?). If the lift is larger, the influence 
degree of data item set X on data item set Y is larger. 
Generally speaking, lift of useful association rules is 
above 1. If the confidence of association rules is 
larger than expected confidence, it illuminates that 
appearance of X promotes the appearance of Y, and 
it also illuminates the relativity between them. If lift 
is not above 1, the association rules are out of 
meanings.  
B.  Apriori algorithm  
Given a transaction set D, association rules mining is to 
form a association rule with support and confidence which 
are larger than min-support and min-confidence. If the rule 
fulfills thresholds of min-support and min-confidence, it is 
called strong rule. Min-support expresses the minimum 
degree that a data item set should meet in the statistical sense. 
And the min-confidence is the one that association rules 
must satisfy, which is defined by user. It represents the 
minimum reliability of association rules. If the support of 
data item set is above or up to min-support, the set is called 
frequent item set or large item set. 
Agrawal(1993)designed a basic algorithm Apriori[4], 
which is based on the idea of two phases frequent item set. 
The design of association rules mining algorithm can be 
divided into two sub-issues:  
• Identify all of large item sets which are existing in 
database: First calculate Candidate 1 – item set (k-
item set is a set containing k items), and then find the 
frequent 1 – item set; according to the frequent 1 - 
item set, determine the candidate 2 – item set and 
then find frequent 2 – item set, ..., and so on, until 
there is no candidate item. The last set is the large 
item set.  
• According to the rules and confidence, use large 
item sets to produce strong rules. 
III. CASE ANALYSIS 
A. Description of the problem 
When dealing with residents travel survey data, it is not 
only to statistically analyze the travel characteristics of 
residents, but also to consider the knowledge hidden in 
resident survey data lists. The knowledge is often based on 
the synchronous appearance probability of several survey 
indexes, that is, when the index "travel purpose = work" 
appears in a range, the probability of the index "travel mode 
= bus" appears in another range (or the association among 
multiple indexes). Knowing these relations, the relations of 
indexes will be found. It provides a basis to analyze issues on 
the view of relations. The study method of relations among 
residents travel characteristics’ indexes is to analyze 
concretely using association rules. Viz. change the 
quantitative data into Boolean association based on specified 
min-support and min-confidence defined by user interface. 
Carry out data mining by computer in order to get the 
association rules of various indexes and travel modes. 
B. Data Preparation 
This paper took information records of residents travel 
survey in Fuzhou in 2008 as database. 
Fuzhou is the capital of Fujian Province, which is famous 
as the country's historical and cultural city. It is an important 
trade center of Chinese southeast coast, a modern port city. 
In recent years, the society and economy of Fuzhou 
developed rapidly. With the increasingly growing of urban 
population, conflicts of urban traffic were acute. As the basis 
of transport planning and building, residents travel survey 
was put forward [5]. Residents travel survey in Fuzhou was 
conducted in 2008, which collected more than 5,000 survey 
samples. The resident travel survey data were list in table 1. 
The values of indexes express the options, and the definitions 
of indexes were in table2. 
C.  Data Processing 
Using neural network to preprocess survey data, it was 
found that the influence of the seven indexes, travel mode in 
common use, purpose, work, income, quantity of bicycle 
holding, family monthly payment of traffic, age, on the 
choice of travel modes were larger than those three indexes, 
residence, feeling of urban traffic, and gender.. Importance 
degree of each index was shown in figure1. 
 
Figure 1.  Importance degree of each index 
Therefore, choosing the seven indexes proposed to 
analyze characteristics of group in each travel mode. Flow 
chat of association analysis is shown in figure 2.  
Because the data of travel modes such as taxi, private car, 
regular bus, and electric bike were very few, this paper 
mainly analyzed the characteristics of four kinds of travel 
modes: walking, bike, bus and motorbike. The results were 
list in table 3.   
The model training used more than 5,000 residents travel 
survey samples, and in the model training, the min-
confidence was 60%, min-support was 3%. So the 
confidence of rules calculated by the model was larger than 
60%, and the support was larger than 3%. The rules were 
valid.

D. Analysis  
From table 2 we can conclude that:  
• The meaning of Rule 1 is: the residents who chose 
travel mode “5”(i.e. motorbike) were basically 
workers, the ages of them arranged from 20 to 39 
and they had a certain income. The confidence of 
this rule is 66.50%, with high credibility. That is, the 
possibility of worker, whose age was between 20 
and 39, income between 100 thousand and 300 
thousand, to travel by motorbike is 66.5%. At the 
same time, the ratio of number of records which 
measured up the rule to the number of survey 
samples was 7.5%, i.e. among the 5000 samples, 
there were 375 residents measured up the rule. The 
confidence of data samples was high.  
• Rule 2 illustrated there were 63.8 percents of 
residents, who usually traveled by motorbike and 
family monthly payment of traffic was among 50 
yuan and 100yuan, chose motorbike as their travel 
mode. 3.1 percents of samples measured up this rule, 
i.e. 155 samples supported this rule.  
• Rules 3 and 4 showed that the main transport 
instrument of residents with travel mode 3 (i.e. bus) 
was bus. The number of samples supported this rule 
was 710, and the confidence was also larger than 
60%. Most of these residents were in the vicinity of 
downtown, and more convenient to travel by bus. 
Because most of companies and factories in Fuzhou 
moved from urban areas to suburb, such as Mawei, 
Qingkou and so on, the workers didn’t hold bikes as 
transport instrument, so bus system become their 
main travel mode. 
• The family monthly payment of traffic for residents 
who chose travel mode 2 was almost below 50 yuan, 
and their income was low. Of course, some of them 
were students or workers who lived nearby. Rule 5 
showed if the family has 2 bikes, they might go to 
work by bike with the possibility of 67.4%. 595 
samples supported this rule, which were 11.9% of 
the total samples. Rule 6 showed employees whose 
annual income less than 0.1 million inhabitants, and 
between the ages of 20-39, would choose bike as 
their transport instrument with the possibility of 
66.7%, 425 samples supported this rule, which were 
8.5% of the total samples. 
• Rule 7 referred to some residents shopping on 
holidays, their travel purpose was shopping, and 
their annual income was below 0.1 million, while the 
family monthly payment of traffic was less than 50 
yuan. Consider the support and confidence, 
485residents met this rule, which was 9.7% of the 
total samples and with high confidence 72.60?. So, 
the traffic issues aroused due to larger number of 
people in some lively, bustling area should be 
concerned. 
• Rule 9 referred to some elder people, most of them 
chose walking as their primary travel mode and it 
was also a relatively large proportion. Therefore, 
accessibility design for the elder should be 
concerned in transport planning. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
As information technology develops continuously, data 
mining has also been widely used. Using data mining to 
analyze residents’ travel characteristics, the universal 
characteristics can be calculated by the small amount of 
sample data, so as to guide the transport planning and design 
more effectively. In this paper, neural network was used to 
filter the indexes of residents’ travel characteristics analysis, 
in order to reduce the larger deviation made by man-made 
factors, and then used association rules to analyze the 
characteristics. The characteristics of each travel mode were 
clearly showed by relative rules, which is of great practical 
significance in guiding transport planning.
