I.  INTRODUCTION  
Ball game is an important component part in the field of 
competitive sports. The field of competitive sports has 
accumulated a large amount of data. At present, The 
analysis on these data uses statistical methods. Sports 
statistics mainly use the statistical principles and 
methods[1].The disadvantage of statistical methods is 
random sampling. It will lost useful information, and do not 
have good results for dealing with large amounts of data. In 
addition, most of the statistical analysis techniques are on 
the basis of perfect mathematical theory and lofty technique, 
so it requires high performance for users[2]. Analyze the data 
in the area of competitive sports by using Data Mining 
technique ,discover the important information easily be 
overlooked and help coaches make the right judgments have 
became a new challenge on the road of sports information. 
One main feature of ball games is the relationship of 
technical movements. So association rule mining has 
became an important part of analysis of ball games. At 
present, ball association rules mining are mainly focused on 
application of Apriori Algorithm. According to the concept 
of support, it analyses the correlate of actions users specify, 
but has not formed a wide range of association rule mining. 
This paper adopts Apriori algorithm to analyze match data 
on the basis of information collection of ball games, 
resolves the problem of association rule mining on technical 
movements of ball games, and achieves the purpose of 
assisting coaches with decision-making. 
II. SCRIPTING COLLECTION METHOD OF BALL 
GAMES 
Balls mentioned in this paper include volleyball, table 
tennis and basketball. In this paper, association rule mining 
is on the basis of data collection of ball games, so the 
description and collection methods of ball scripting 
language must be designed. The common feature of ball 
scripting description language is that the language must can 
descript the process of games, so the collection method of 
ball games is based on process. That requires designing a 
variety of ball scripting language according to the 
characteristics of technical movement and games. 
Ball scripting description language is defined in the 
analysis system. The collection technique is based on 
technical movements coding, which collect the technical 
movements athletes actually use into computer, according to 
technical movement encoding rules. Coding uses the form 
of four yards, and is separated by dots. Below take the table 
tennis as an example to illustrate the design method of 
scripting description language and the design method of 
scripting collection. The scripting language definition of 
table tennis and basketball, and scripting collection adopt 
similar design approach. This paper does not elaborate on 
that. 
The scripting coding rule of table tennis includes hitting 
approaches, hitting effects, technical movements and where 
the ball is, among which, hitting approaches are classified 
into fifteen kinds, that is active forehand oblique line(Z), 
active backhand oblique line(F),passive forehand oblique 
line(B), passive backhand oblique line(T),sideways oblique 
line(C),active forehand midst (A), active backhand midst(K), 
passive forehand midst (Q), passive backhand midst(L), 
sideways midst(P), active forehand beeline(G), active 
backhand beeline(Y), passive forehand beeline(W), passive 
backhand beeline(D) and sideways beeline(S);hitting effects 
are classified into downward swirling(X),side upwards(S), 
side downwards (C),not-rotation(B) and fast rush ball(K); 
technical movements are classified into serve(F),attacking 
ball(G), loop drive(H),chop stroke(X), swing(B), chop(C), 
block (D), hand-picking (T), split(P);table tennis table is 
devided  into ten zones. On the basis of above encoding rule, 
schematic diagram of technique movement coding rule is as 
follows.

According to the above coding rule, a round of table 
tennis competition ”active forehand oblique line downward 
swirling near net 16 active backhand oblique line chop far 
away from table 61 active backhand oblique line loop drive 
far away from table 12 active backhand oblique line block

III. DESIGN OF APPRIORI ALGORITHM IN 
ANALYSE OF BALL TECHNICAL MOVEMENTS 
Apriori algorithm is a basic algorithm to find frequent 
item sets[3].In acquisition and analysis system of ball games, 
collect match data according to the collection method of 
scripting language. In the database, a round of the 
competition is stored as a record. The design goal of Apriori 
is to form an association rule mining middleware. Thorough 
iteration, it searches out all frequent item sets of the 
transaction database to lay the foundation for generating 
association rules.  
A. Design of Transaction Database Table  
Transaction data sets is the direct data source of 
association rule mining[4].Boolean association rule mining is 
based on transaction database. Transaction table is 
generated on the basis of processing the data in relational 
database of ball games. The relational database of ball 
games includes match information table and scripting 
information table. They build relationships through match 
number. Transaction table take technical movements of 
table tennis as fields. 
Data processing mainly uses the method of separation. 
Separate the scripting records by dots, subtract zones, just 
leave match actions ,gain and loss mark. Then extract all 
actions of the member to be analyzed. In accordance with 
considerations of boolean association rules, assign 1 on the 
corresponding action code field position of the transaction 
table. 
B. Algorithm Design 
Agrawal firstly proposed the association rule mining 
problem among item sets of custom transaction database in 
1993[5].Apriori algorithm finds all frequent item sets of 
transaction database through recursion.Firstly,generate 
frequent 1-item sets L1,then generate frequent 2-item sets 
L2,until there is some value ,which makes L is empty, 
algorithm stops. In the k iteration, firstly generate candidate 
k-item set Ck, the scan database to calculate the support 
count of every item set, reserve the item sets to form 
frequent k-item sets. Their support is greater than or equal to 
the minimum degree of support. In which, Ck need two steps 
to generate. 
1)joining. Every item set is generated by joining two 
item sets of Lk-1.The two item sets must meet the following 
requirements. Their previous (k-2) items are the same, and 
the (k-1) item is different from each other. 
2)pruning. Any non-empty subset of a frequent item sets 
is frequent item sets, so after joining, it need delete the 
frequent item sets, which have non-frequent subset. That is 
pruning[6]. 
The pseudocode[7] of Apriori algorithm is as follows. 
L1=find_frequent_1-itemsets(D)? 
for(k=2?Lk-1???k++){ 
Ck=apriori_gen(Lk-1?min_sup)? 
for each transaction t? D{//scan D for counts 
Ct=subset(Ck? t)? 
for each candidate c? Ct 
c. count ++? 
} 
L k = {c? C k | c. count ? min_sup}  
} 
return L=?k L k? 
prodedure  apriori _ gen(Lk-1:frequent(k-1)- itemsets;  
min_sup : minimu  m support threshold) 
for each itemset l1?Lk-1 
for each itemset l2?Lk-1 
if(l1[1]=l2[1])?(l1[2]=l2[2])?…?(l1[k-2]=l2[k-
2])?(l1[k-1]<l2[k-1]) then{ 
      c=l1f l2;//join step:generate candidates 
      if has_infrequent_subset(c,Lk-1) then 
delete c; 
else add c to Ck; 
} 
return Ck; 
procedure has_infrequent_subset(c:candidate k-itemset;  
Lk-1: frequent(k-1)-itemset)  
for each (k-1)-subset s of c 
if s?Lk-1 then 
 return TRUE; 
 return FALSE; 
IV. CASE ANALYSIS 
In this paper, Apriori algorithm middleware has been 
applied in the table tennis technical and tactical analysis 
system, and achieved good result. It gives the maximum 
support for the table tennis technical and tactical analysis 
system. 
A. Data Preprocessing 
This paper chooses three games of Wang Hao, china 
table tennis team members as analysis object of mining  
association rules. Extract match code from table tennis 
relational database. The data format is “zx16. fc61. fh12. 
fd20.”.That is the description of a round of competition. 
Now, separate the code, the separation steps are as follows. 
1)Firstly, separate the code, subtract zones, just leave 
math actions , gain and loss score. Separate the above code, 
then get the action ZX,FC,FH and FD. 
2)Check out whether the member to be analyzed is 
serving side. If he is, extract his actions from the first action, 
and then extract interval action until the record is end. If he 
is not, extract his actions from the second action, then 
extract interval action until the record is end. 
3)After separating, assign 1 on the corresponding action 
code field position of the transaction table.

B. Mining Frequent Item Sets 
In order to find high confidence association rules in a 
large range, we set lower minimum support threshold. 
Suppose the minimum support threshold is 1%,minmum 
confidence level threshold is 40%.This paper mines 
association rules among three games of Wang Hao, a total 
of 352 valid data by using Apriori algorithm middleware. In 
order to unify abbreviations, code gain score as GO and loss 
score as LO. The specific process is as follows. 
1)Read record data into vector container; 
2)Count every word in the vector container, and store 
the word and its number into another vector container; 
3)Every word is a member of candidate 1-item set C1.If 
the word’s support count is greater than or equal to the 
minmum support count,it can become frequent 1-item 
set,and be sotred into frequent 1-item sets vector 
container.The process of generating frequent 1-item sets is 
as figure 2.Because the candidate item sets and frequent 
item sets are large enough,this paper can not enumerate. 
4)Join L1,L1?L1,and generate candidate 2-item sets 
C2.Count every word of C2. If the word’s support count is 
greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can 
become frequent 2-item set,and be sotred into frequent 2-
item sets vector container. 
5) Join L2,L2?L2,and generate candidate 3-item sets C3. 
Count every word of C3. If the word’s support count is 
greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can 
become frequent 3-item set,and be sotred into frequent 3-
item sets vector container. 
6) Join L3,and generate candidate 4-item sets C4.C4 is 
null. End.

C. Generate Association Rules 
The association rules of transaction database is to find 
the relationship among item sets[8].Strong association rules 
meet the minimum support threshold and the minimum 
confidence threshold. Find frequent item sets from database 
D, then generate strong association rules.The process is as 
follows[2]. 
1)For every frequent item set l, generate its all non-
empty subsets; 
2)For a non-empty subset s of l, if 
conf
scountport
lcountport
min_
)(_sup
)(_sup t ,put out the rules “s=>(l-
s)”. 
In which, min_conf is minimum confidence threshold. 
Figure 3 is the association rule mining result.

D. Result Analysis 
Analyze the association rule mining results of math data 
of Wang Hao,we can get that his forehand and backhand are 
both skilled.His main score point is attacking ball, in 
combination with loop drive and fast band. Coaches should 
be thinking about is that how to combine with fast band, 
loop drive ,attacking ball to increase the probability score. 
Wang Hao’s main losing score point is defense. How to 
reduce defense losing score is also an important problem. 
But in the mining results, there are still unreasonable 
association rules. That is unavoidable. However, how to 
delete the unreasonable association rules to increase the 
correctness of mining results is to be resolved. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the solution and realization scheme for 
association rule mining on analysis system of ball matches 
by Apriori algorithm is proposed. A Apriori algorithm 
middleware is realized, and it has been verified in the table 
tennis technical and tactical analysis system, achieved the 
expected purpose. The association rule analysis is more 
universal than that between specified actions. Coaches can 
observe association rules to find hidden information. But 
how to increase the correctness of mining results is to be 
resolved. At present, in order to find a suitable threshold to 
analyze the association rules, coaches can only set different 
levels of support threshold and confidence threshold to 
observe the changes in association rules.
