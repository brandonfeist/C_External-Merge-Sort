I. INTRODUCTION  
Along with Internet rapid development, the Websites 
have already become main places where people gain the 
resources and communicate now and in the future. However, 
the Web link structures of Website also become more 
complex, which causes the users hard to search the need 
information. In order to help users to fast search the useful 
information, it is necessary to carry on the optimization to 
the Web structure, which achieves the initiative 
recommendation of the information. Nowadays, many 
people study the optimization of the Web structure, for 
example, using the mining of Web logs to realize the 
optimization of the Web structure, but few people study the 
appraise of the result of Web structure optimization. In fact, 
it is very significant to appraise the result of Web structure 
optimization, because the appraisal goal is for optimizing 
well. 
In this paper, an evaluation function of the Web site 
optimization is proposed by combination between maximal 
forward reference path and reference length, which make the 
transaction more accurate to optimize the Web structure, and 
verified through the experimental data. 
II. WEB STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS AND 
SIGNIFICANCE 
The Web structure optimization mainly carries on the 
optimization to the Web page link structure, its optimized 
goal is for increasing the valid link, and enhancing the search 
result place, which will be advantageous for the users to find 
need information quickly. 
The Web link structure may divide into the basic link 
structure and the additional link structure, once when the 
Web structure gets down fixedly, we cannot change the basic 
structure at will, because changing the structure will cause 
the customers hard to find the page which they have visited 
before, thus it will cause the outflow of the customers. The 
Web structure optimization is generally through mining and 
analysis the Web logs files which the users stay on the server 
when they glance over Web to realize. 
To optimize the website, two aspects must be analyzed: 
not only to discover the association pages, but also to 
discover the unreasonable ultra link. This article mainly aims 
at the Web link structure, resting on the result of mining Web 
logs files, using the association rule and the false association 
rule to analysis, dynamic to optimize the Web structure.  
Based on the association rule analysis, many associated 
patterns can be found, but with business change and time 
pass, these patterns are often also no longer established. We 
need one method to confirm these patterns, the false 
association rule can be available to discover the kind of 
obsolete and unreasonable pattern, and the definition of false 
association rule are as follows: 
To suppose },{ EVG =  to express the oriented graph 
which is composed by an item of collection and during the 
items of collection association rule, in which V  expresses an 
item of collection set, lVj ? , we call it a k - item of 
collection set, k =| jV |. l  expresses all of item set. E  
expresses association rule set, namely EYX ?? . 
If ?  is a real number, called it the most doubting, 
recorded it suspectmax , then there 
is ??? )( YXconfidence .  
Now we carry on the confirmation to each by the 
association rule EYX ??  to distinguish whether it was 
still established or not. If the support or the confidence level 
of association rule is lower than the threshold value which 
assigns separately, then we call this rule false association 
rule, with YX ?>  expression. 
YX ?  is existence , if the expression 
portYXport supmin)(sup ??  or 
suspectYXconfidence max)( ??  is established, we call 
YX ?  association rule and record it YX ?> . 
Speaking of the false association rule, it should be to 
discover he association rule which has been discovered, 
which support is smaller than portsupmin  or confidence 
level is smaller than suspectmax . In here the significance of 
the support and confidence level of false association rule and 
association rule is same. No matter the support is association 
rule’s or the false association rule’s, the incidence relation 
first should be satisfied; The smallest support of the false

association rule is equal to the association rule’s; The 
confidence level has reflected the rule strong or weak, when 
the confidence level is lower than the smallest confidence 
level of the association rule slightly, which is insufficient to 
explain that the rule is untenable, only when the belief level 
is enough small, namely which is smaller than the most 
doubting, we can explain that the rule has been untenable. 
We should see the false association rule is compared to the 
association rule weaker. 
 
 
III. APPRAISAL PLAN OF WEB STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION 
BASED ON VISITING THING 
A. Appraisal of Web structure optimization based on 
average of maximal forward reference path 
 
When a user visits a content Web page, it is often not 
because of the content of this page, but through the other 
navigation page. In order to appraise the optimized degree of 
the Web structure, we give the following several definitions: 
The definition of maximal forward reference path: 
>=< mlllmfp ,......,2,1  
l  is the reference page: >=< lengthltimelurlll .,.,. . 
When the user visits the Web page, the page visited with 
difficulty locates at the deep level generally, moreover takes 
the big storage space. To visit deep level page is essential to 
pass many intermediate level page, and all of the users on 
each intermediate level page have the possibility to change to 
visit other pages, therefore it will cause the possibility of he 
users visiting the page to reduce. Obviously, if two pages 
have not the ultra link to be connected but the incidence 
relation, the corresponding maximal forward reference path 
will be very long, thus it will take to the user to be 
inconvenient. Therefore, appraisal of Web structure 
optimization based on average of maximal forward reference 
path is reasonable, if average of maximal forward reference 
path of the website is shorter equally, the degree of 
optimization will be higher.  
Generally speaking, one web log database contains tow 
nodes (source node ( is ), goal node ( id )) of a browsing 
patch. The start source node of a new browsing is empty. As 
follows is the algorithm of maximal forward reference path. 
Step 1: i=1, Y=null, F=1// to initialize variables and 
suppose that user is glancing over page forward  
Step 2: A= is , B= id . If A=null then 
Begin 
  If Y<>null then  
Output Y to database DF 
  Y=B; 
  Go to Step 5; 
End 
Step 3:  If B?Y then 
Begin 
  If F=1 then 
     Output Y to database DF 
     Delete mj YY ,......,  
       F=0 
     Go to Step 5 
End 
Step 4: Append B to Y //to append B to Y 
If F=0 then 
F=1  
Step 5: i=i+1 
For DF mfpi = >< mlll ,......,2,1  do 
j=1 
for k=(1…m) do 
    Begin 
If  timelengthlk min. >  
Insert kj ll ......  into database MFP//MFP is improved thing 
database 
j=k+1; 
End 
B. Appraisal of Web structure optimization based on 
length of reference time  
User continues take the page as the navigation page to 
visit other pages, after the user glances over a content page, 
which will increase length of maximal forward reference 
path. Theoretically, the action of visiting can be divided into 
two or more things, but from the viewpoint of maximal 
forward reference, it is actually one thing.  
The length of reference time is based on the kind of 
supposition: The total time of user glancing over a page and 
the page whether is the navigation page or the content page 
is related. Generally speaking, the time of user spending on 
navigation page is always short, but it spending on the 
content page is longer. Therefore, we can judge that the page 
is navigation page or content page through expenditure of 
time which the user spends in glancing over on the Web 
page. 
Now we redefine the thing as 
follows: ).......,.,.{(,,. 111 lengthltimelurlluidtrltrliptrl
rlrlrl ttt
=<  
>)}.,.,.( lengthltimelurll rlrlrl tm
t

In which,

expresses the set of logs. LI ? , which contains ipl. ? uidl.
?URL? timel.  and lengthl. . If the page is a content page, 
there is timelengthltrlm min. > . 
imeM int , average time of visiting the page, is the 
smallest time value for discrimination of navigation page and 
content page. The definition is as follows:

C. statement of Web logical structure optimization 
appraisal objective function  
According to above analysis, we can judge the page 
whether is navigation page or content page through the 
552
average time of reference. If the reference length is shorter 
equally, then we can think the degree of the Web page 
optimization is higher. 
In the ordinary circumstance, user always hope to find 
the page which one wants to visit as soon as possible, 
whether a Web link structure is reasonable or not, we can 
judge it through the maximal forward reference path when 
user visits the content page. Facing the circumstance that the 
different user visits different page, we can appraise the 
optimization of Web structure through the computation of 
maximal forward reference path. Obviously, when a user 
visits the identical content page, the page number which the 
user must pass through is smaller, the web link structure 
optimization is better. 
Therefore, we should consider the factor of the maximal 
forward reference path and threshold value hypothesis of the 
average reference time length equally to appraise the 
optimization of Web structure. The hypothesis of appraisal 
objective function is as follows. 
t
t

tf
?
=
=
1)(  
In which, t  expresses the total number of things, ts  
expresses the total page number of each thing, )(tf  
expresses the average value of reference length? 
In the database of MFP, the total page of each visiting 
thing is recorded. We can discover the total page number of 
each visiting thing. It is easy to calculate the total page 
number P  of all the things and the total number t  of all 
things. The result of p/t is the average value of reference 
length. Whenever the page is carried on an optimization to 
the website, the result of p/t should be as far as possible 
small, such optimization will be significance. It is worth of 
emphasizing, the result of p/t will tend to be smaller with 
optimization of the Web structure successfully and 
continually, if the page is carried on very big changing, the 
optimization value will not be comparative as last time. 
Supposing that the log data has been already processed 
for the form of user conversation, we can describe the 
algorithm of the thing of reference length as follows: 
For all sessions do 
For all pages of session do 
Begin 
         p++ 
         If timelengthltrlm min. >  
t++ 
End 
Result = p/t 
IV. EXPERIMENT 
To test the Web structure optimization appraisal plan 
mentioned above, here provides the following experiment 
system, experiment process and its result aiming at a high 
school website to optimize and appraisal the logic structure. 
A. Experiment system framework 
The design of experiment system is based on Windows, 
Java and Mysql. Its function can be approximately divided 
into log preconditioning, algorithm implementation, 
optimization analysis. The main task of system is to control 
the operation process of whole system, to call all other 
functional patterns. It includes data cleaning, user 
conversation identification, thing identification, association 
rule analysis, false association rule analysis, website 
optimization appraisal and so on. Among them the objective 
function will be used to appraise the optimization for website 
optimization appraisal pattern. 
B. Log cleaning 
In log processing stage, the logs of pages ended with 
.mpga, .gif, .css, .js ect, need to be cleaned, and other logs of 
pages ended with .jsp, .html, .asp,.php ect.need to be kept. 
As figure 1 shows the cleaned log records storing in the 
Mysql database.   
 
Figure 1.  cleaned log records  
After log cleaned, the conversation and thing analysis is 
to be carried on. User maybe visits the same website for 
many times in Web server log of the wide spanning time 
section. The target of conversation analysis is to divide the 
visit record into single conversation. A conversation is 
composed of several things. Here we take 30 minutes as once 
conversation time, while taking average page visit timemin  
as once thing time. The log conversation and the result of 
thing processed are as figure 2 shows. 
 
Figure 2.  the log conversation and the result of thing processed  
C. Algorithm implementation 
The experiment system mainly uses algorithm of 
association rule and algorithm of false association rule to 
analyze the Web hyperlink. The following is the result of 
553
website log of a high school worked out by association rule 
and false association rule.  
The process of association rule analysis: put the entire 
hyperlink pattern found by association rule into a database, 
then test every hyperlink pattern on the website. If the 
hyperlink exists, it will be deleted from the database, 
otherwise, keep it. Finally, hyperlink in the database will be 
man-analyzed to make sure whether it can be used to 
optimize the website or not, just as figure 3 shows:  
 
Figure 3.  the result of association rule analysis of Web page  
The process of false association rule analysis: Firstly, put 
the web hyperlink into database by web spider, then, in the 
cleaned log records, calculate its support and doubting to 
determine whether the hyperlink is still suitable or not one by 
one. If the hyperlink is suitable, it will be deleted from 
database, otherwise not. At last, hyperlink pattern in the 
database will be man-analyzed to make sure whether it is 
suitable to website optimization or not. Figure 4 is result of 
rule kuandai.htm and xgxx.htm carried on: 
 
Figure 4.  the result of false associated rule analysis  
D. Optimization appraisal analysis 
The procedure reads thing database firstly, then works 
out average reference length value according to website 
optimization appraisal algorithm based on average reference 
length thing. The following is the result of appraisal of the 
website before optimized and after optimized, as figure 5, 
figure 6: 
 
Figure 5.  the result of the first Web structure optimization appraisal  
 
Figure 6.  the result of  the second Web structure optimization appraisal 
From the figure 5 and figure 6 we can know, the value of 
second website optimization is 5.43, less than 5.58. That is to 
say, the web structure has been improved. It is necessary to 
remark that the web structure appraisal always refers to 
comparison of two optimization values now and last. If the 
website structure has been carried on a large-scale 
adjustment, the comparison does not have the significance. 
V. CONCLUDING REMARK 
 
The failed link of website is not only to reduce the 
authority of website, but also to affect the corporation 
business or the sale of products. Web structure optimization 
can provide the effective server to users and enhance the visit 
quantity of website, while, to avoid obsolete and invalid 
hyperlink, it requests urgently us to dynamic appraise its 
optimization.
