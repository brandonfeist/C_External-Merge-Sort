I.  INTRODUCTION 
As computer technologies become more ubiquitous, besides 
numerical and categorical data, various digitalized images, 
sounds, voices, and videos have become part of daily life. 
Plenty of knowledge can be hidden in these data, it is since 
1970th people devoted themselves into image retrieval 
research, then text based image retrieval technology and 
context web retrieval technology were proposed, which in a 
certain extent solved some image retrieval and resource 
discovery problems. However, people are not satisfied with 
only being able to access information, because through image 
retrieval people can only find out the relative information they 
want, they can’t dig out valuable knowledge hidden in large 
sets of image data. Thus, image mining was introduced, Image 
mining concerns the extraction of implicit knowledge, image 
data relationship, or other patterns not explicitly stored in the 
images. It is more than just an extension of data mining to 
image domain. Image mining is an interdisciplinary endeavor 
which draws upon expertise in computer vision, image 
understanding, data mining, machine learning, database, and 
artificial intelligence. 
II. CHARACTERISTICS OF IMAGE MINING 
As an interdisciplinary research field, Image mining has 
its own characteristics as follows: 
A. Dependence on spatial information 
Spatial information is vital for interpretation of image 
content but there isn’t such requirement in traditional data 
mining. 
B. Dependence on knowledge of a specific field 
Interpretation of image contents is achieved through high-
level semantic, which is produced by knowledge reasoning. 
Thus, merely by using low-level global visual content features, 
such as color, texture, shape, is not sufficient for expressing 
high-level semantic information correctly, which brings around 
a “semantic gap” problem, a lot of knowledge of a specific 
field is needed to solve this problem. 
C. Various interpretations for visual mode 
For the same visual mode, there has multiple interpretations 
for it, usually special field experts are needed to take part in the 
interpretation process. 
D. Complexity of the image mining process 
Image Mining not only analyzes and discovers a mode, but 
it also has to deal with the operations related to mining system 
such as image retrieval, indexing, and storing, which play 
important roles in the final mining results, all this processes add 
difficulties to image mining. 
III. OVERALL PROCESS OF IMAGE MINING  
Image mining is just at its infancy, however, observing 
from some of the existing image mining systems, overall 
process can be divided into the following parts: 
A. Data preprocess  
There exist a lot of dirty and noisy data in large image 
databases, for instance, images that are extremely unclear and 
images that are already breached. Those data often cause chaos 
in mining process and give birth to bad mining results, so it is 
necessary to preprocess data, clean up the noisy, broken, dirty 
data. 
B. Extracting multi-dimensional feature vectors  
Using image processing technologies such as image 
segmentation, picking up the edge to extract task-related 
feature vectors, form multi-dimensional feature vectors. 
C. Mining on vectors and acquire high-level knowledge  
Various methods such as object recognition, image 
indexing and retrieval, image classification and clustering, 
neural network are used on feature vectors for mining and 
acquiring hidden and valuable high-level knowledge, then 
evaluate and explain that knowledge.  
IV. MAIN TECHNOLOGY ANALYZE  
A. Preprocessing  
Image mining deals with large collection of image 
datasets that are high-dimensional and have multiple features, 
so time and space cost are relative high when analysis them. In 
order to improve quality and efficiency of the following mining

steps, it is vital to discover suitable preprocessing technologies 
to clean up the un-related data and make useful hidden 
information more obvious. Traditional image processing 
technologies are applied to the image data ready to be mined. 
Some image preprocess has been introduced, for instance, Han 
propose a palm-print-based identification system in [1], the 
pre-processing steps including image-thresholding, border-
tracing and wavelet-based segmentation, the preprocessing 
method is proved to be effective and can be simulated in other 
scenarios as well. 
B. Feature extraction 
One of the key problems is how to express image data, 
which can usually be represented by features such as texture, 
color, edge, shape. According to the mining object, extract the 
basic elements that can present the images, omit features 
inessential to mining result. In some cases, to get better mining 
result, it is necessary to converge many features to form multi-
dimensional feature vectors. Color, edge, texture are very 
important features in image mining and are widely used. [2] 
presents a feature extraction method that uses a combination of 
features: color, edge, texture, the method achieves high recall 
and precision. 
C. Image mining technology  
     Most commonly used image mining technologies are image 
classification, image clustering, mining association rules and 
neural network. 
1) Image classification  
Image classification is to do quantity analysis on image, and 
, it is a supervised learning method, a set of pre-labeled images 
are provided, then based on prior knowledge, tag the new 
images with suitable labels, often there are three processes 
involved in image classification:(1): Feature extraction, first 
build up a image representation model, extract features from 
sample images that are already labeled and establish feature 
description for each image; (2): Train the samples of each class 
and establish model description for each class; (3): Use the 
model to classify and index images that are not labeled. The 
most commonly used image classification technologies are as 
follows: Bayes, neural network, decision tree, support vector 
machine, K-nearest -neighbor-classifier, genetic algorithm etc. 
Performance of a classifier is normally measured by accuracy 
of prediction, speed, robustness, extensibility. 
2)  Image clustering  
The process of grouping a set of images into classes of 
similar images without prior knowledge is called image 
clustering. It is a unsupervised learning method, images within 
a cluster have high similarity in comparison to one another but 
are very dissimilar to images in other clusters. The process 
normally comprises of 4 steps: (1) Image representation, 
feature extraction and selection; (2) Set up similarity metrics 
suitable for special application; (3) Image clustering; (4) Form 
clusters. After clustering, field experts are required to examine 
each cluster and label it with abstract concepts. Nowadays there 
are many clustering algorithms such as: partitioning methods, 
hierarchical methods, grid-based methods, model-based 
methods, etc. 
3) Association rules mining  
          Association rule mining finds interesting associations 
and correlation relationships among large set of image data. 
Association rules show attribute value conditions that occur 
frequently together in a given dataset. Association rule mining 
consists of first finding frequent item sets, from which strong 
association rules are generated. These rules also satisfy a 
minimum confidence threshold. In recent years, association 
rule mining has become a heated problem and draws upon wide 
attention. Apriori is a typical algorithm for association rule 
mining, based on which there are a lot of improvement, for 
example, in [3], Anthony proposes a novel spatial mining 
algorithm to mine the spatial association rules from an image 
database, which prunes most of impossible candidates in the 
mining process, thus the proposed algorithm is more efficient 
than the Apriori algorithm. The experiment results show that it 
runs 2–5 times faster than the Apriori algorithm. 
V. APPLICATION OF IMAGE MINING 
Image mining is a future trend, although it is a new research 
area, its development shows great potential, as far as now its 
application has expanded to various domains and gained good 
results. 
Mining on medical images is to acquire valuable 
knowledge and modes, which can later be used for discovering 
abnormal situations not consistent with the previous common 
modes. This can act as a reference and help doctors diagnose 
diseases. [4] presents a new image mining technique for brain 
tumor classification using pruned association rule, which 
combines the low-level features extracted from images and 
high level knowledge from specialists. The method can classify 
the CT scan brain images into three categories namely normal, 
benign and malign. It can assist the physicians for efficient 
classification with multiple keywords per image to improve the 
accuracy. The experimental result on pre-diagnosed database of 
brain images showed 96% and 93% sensitivity and accuracy 
respectively. 
Image mining can also be used on satellite cloud imagery, 
Asanobu use SOM(Self-Organizing Feature Map) neural 
network to do image clustering on Typhoon image 
collections[5], and use the data mining methods to analysis 
typhoon patterns and predict typhoon. Edward etc apply a new 
clustering method and build up a system called RIME for 
detecting copying unauthorized image on the internet, the 
system first cluster similar images, then index each cluster, it 
achieves high accuracy[6]. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Image mining is a promising field for research, however, it 
is still at the beginning and for future development the 
following problems need to be considered: 
 Improvement on image preprocessing technologies, 
including feature extraction, image segmentation, object 
identification. 
 Propose an united image representation model and 
representation techniques. 
 Devise highly efficient and extensible image mining 
algorithms, for traditional techniques are hard to directly
