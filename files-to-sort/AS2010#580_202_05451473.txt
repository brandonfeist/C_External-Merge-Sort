Abstract—In order to improve boiler efficiency and reduce 
NOx emissions of a coal-fired boiler, a new solution strategy of 
combustion optimization is proposed is this paper. The key 
point of combustion optimization is the optimal setpoints of 
fuel and air parameters. As the development of electric 
industry, large amounts of history data are accumulated and 
data mining technique is applied to find some useful results. 
Fuzzy sets theory is introduced into the association mining 
process in order to soften the partition boundary of the domain 
and generalize the data. And then cluster algorithm and fuzzy 
association rule are employed to obtain the optimal values of 
important parameters. The rules mined out are combined with 
control system of operation parameters and can be used to 
provide guides for operation. Experimental results in a 
600MW power plant show that the method is useful and 
effective.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Thermal power unit is a very complex process system, 
for its characteristic of multivariate, strong coupling, 
nonlinear, large delay and uncertainty, optimal control of 
thermal power unit has always been a very difficult problem.  
Boiler combustion process is the most complicated 
process in thermal power unit which changes continuously 
due to coal quality, boiler load, changes in slag/soot 
deposits, ambient conditions, and the condition of plant 
equipment. The quality of combustion has a direct impact 
on boiler efficiency and emission of polluting gas, like 
nitrogen oxides (NOx). 
NOx emission has been an important restrictive 
regulation in many countries in recently years. For instance, 
in the People’s Republic of China, the current NOx 
emission limit for dry bottom boilers with a capacity of 
300MW and larger is 650 mg/m3, and it will decrease in the 
future [1]. As a consequence, the control of NOx emission is 
widely concern as the utilization of fossil fuels continues to 
increase, especially in coal-fired power plants. 
Recently, combustion optimization has been proved to 
be an effective way to realize low NOx combustion and 
high boiler efficiency in coal-fired power unit [2-3]. In view 
of on-line plant data from distributed control system (DCS) 
and continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), the 
relation between NOx emissions, boiler efficiency and 
various operation parameters of the boiler is modeled using 
artificial intelligence such as neural-network, expert system, 
fuzzy logic, generalized regression and support vector 
regression. And then, by combining the optimization 
approach such as genetic algorithm, information analysis 
and ant colony optimization, the model is applied to search 
the optimal operation parameters to achieve the two targets.  
However, data used in the above methods should be 
got by many experiments in power plant which usually are 
hardly to realize for safe concern. And in some papers, some 
special data points are selected to construct models between 
NOx emissions, boiler efficiency and operation parameters. 
Obviously, the results achieved may not be scientific.  
With the development of supervised information 
system (SIS) in China, more and more real-time data are 
sent to database and large amounts of data are accumulated. 
Data Mining, sometimes referred to as knowledge discovery 
from databases, is a non-trivial process of identifying 
implicit, valid, novel, potentially useful and ultimately 
understandable patterns in data. Researchers and engineers 
attempt to apply it in industrial monitoring and control 
process and achieve great success. McGreavy and Wang X 
Z use the KDD techniques to identify the status of the 
chemical industrial process in Britain [4]. Tony Ogilvie and 
B W Hogg put forward method to establish the operating 
models in power plant by data mining techniques [5]. 
In this paper, a complete resolution strategy for 
combustion optimization is proposed based on data mining 
technology. Steady operating data are selected and cluster 
technology is used to classify operating condition. Then, 
fuzzy sets theory is introduced into the association mining 
for continuous data and optimal target values of some 
important operation parameters for combustion optimization 
is obtained to achieve the target of high boiler efficiency 
and low NOx emission. 
 
II. STRUCTURE OF COMBUSTION OPTIMIZATION 
Among all the impacting factors of combustion process, 
fuel and air parameters are the most important controllable 
parameters. Ratio of air flow and fuel flow is a key 
parameter affecting combustion condition in boiler. Proper 
ratio can guarantee complete combustion of fuel in boiler. If 
Volumn 2

 226
the ratio is too large, heat loss of the flue gas will increase 
which can bring decrease of boiler efficiency; meanwhile, 
temperature of flame is not high and generation of NOx can 
be restrained. Otherwise, if the ratio is too small, fuel can’t 
burn completely and heat loss of boiler will increase. So for 
the target of high boiler efficiency and low NOx emission, 
proper ratio of air flow and fuel flow must be concerned. 
For the reason of fluctuation of boiler load and quality 
of fuel, ratio of air and fuel should follow the changes of 
ambient conditions, but not a constant. Then, under different 
operation conditions, how to judge the ratio of air and fuel 
flow? O2 content in flue gas is used to solve this problem. O2 
content in flue gas directly reflects the condition of 
combustion in boiler. Air flow ratio-cascade control system 
in power plant is show inside the dotted line in fig 1. 
Figure 1. Control system of ratio of air and fuel flow and O2 content 
Now the setpoints of O2 content and ratio of air and fuel 
flow f(x) are set by designed values of boiler. However, with 
changes of boiler equipment and ambient conditions, these 
values will not be optimal either for high boiler efficiency or 
low NOx emission. So data mining technology is employed 
in this study to approach the optimal setpoints of ratio f(x) 
and O2 content. And the theory structure is shown in fig 1. 
III. DATA MINING ALGORITHM 
A. Steady Operating Conditon 
Operating condition of power unit is changing a lot and 
only data in steady state can be used for data mining. Steady 
state of a unit is defined as: 
(1) Coordinated control system is on automatic control 
and important auxiliary equipments are running normally. 
(2) Actual load and main steam pressure should be in 
steady state. The stability index of two parameters is defined 
as follows. 
First, normalize the two parameter values: 
nk
A
AA
k
e
B ,...2,1,
minmax
=<
?
= ??  (1) 
Where maxA  and minA  are maximum and minimum of 
parameters in a period, eA  is rated value at rated load, 
and k?  is stability threshold. 
The method used to judge parameter’s stability is 
described as below. In a period of time (such as 20 minutes), 
equation (1) should be satisfied with a certain stability 
threshold, e.g. 0.05k? = . Otherwise, set start point and end 
point of the judging period to 10 minutes later, a new set of 
data containing 20 minutes operation conditions can be 
obtained. Then, judgment on stability can be made again. 
A better method is the statistical analysis based on the 
ratio in (1). Assuming enough ratio data sequence B?  are 
obtained: 1B? , 2B? , …, BN? , N?20. Then the average 
value is: 
NBNBBB /)...( 21 ???? +++=  (2) 
Standard deviation ?  is calculated and then the 
stability index cx  is obtained: 

??= )1/()( 2 NBBi ???  
?? 3±= Bcx  (3) 
When Bi?  has been smaller than cx  continuously for 
more than 20 minutes, the unit is judged as in steady state. 
B. Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Algorithm 
In this paper fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the 
association mining for quantitative data in power plant. The 
proposed fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each 
quantitative value into a fuzzy set using membership 
functions. The algorithm then calculates the scalar 
cardinality of each linguistic term on all the transaction data 
using the temporary set fC . The linguistic term with the 
maximum cardinality is used in later mining processes only, 
thus keeping the number of items the same as that of the 
original attributes. The mining process based on fuzzy 
counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules. The 
detailed mining algorithm is described as follows. 
Input: A body of n  transaction data, each with m  
attribute values, a set of membership functions, a predefined 
minimum support value and a predefined confidence value. 
The p -th attribute in the j -th ( nj ,,2,1 = ) 
transaction can be described by k  membership functions 
)( ps
j
p R? ? ks ,,2,1 = ? , psR ? ks ,,2,1 = ?  is 
fuzzy set.  
Output: A set of fuzzy association rules. 
Step 1: Transform the quantitative value jpt  
( mp ,,2,1 = ) of each transaction jT  ( nj ,,2,1 = ) 
in D into a fuzzy set jpf . So 
j
pt  is described by fuzzy sets 
as:

where spR  ( ks ,,2,1 = )is p -th fuzzy region of

D. 
Step 2: Build a temporary set 1C  including all the pairs 
( spR , )(

s =1,2, k, . For each region spR  stored in 1C  calculate it

p =1 to m, where k is the number of fuzzy regions for 
transaction jT ( nj ,,2,1 = ). 
max
pweight will be used to 
represent this attribute in later mining process. 
Step 4: Check whether the maxpweight of each 
max
pR ( p =1,2, m, ) is larger than or equal to the 
predefined minimum support. If maxpR ( p =1,2, m, ) is 
equal to or larger than the minimum support, put it into the 
set of large 1-itemsets( 1L ). That is, 
?= maxmax1 |{ pp weightRL minsupport, }1 mp ??
 (6) 
Step 5: Set 1=r , where r is used to represent the 
number of items kept in the current large itemsets. 
Step 6: Generate the candidate set 1+rC  from rL . 
Restated, the algorithm joins rL  and rL  under the 
condition that 1?r  items in the two itemsets are the same 
and the other one is different. The itemsets which have all 
their sub-r-itemsets in rL  are put into 1+rC . 
Step 7: Do the following substeps for each newly 
formed (r+1)-itemset ),,,( 121 += rtttt   in 1+rC :

Step 8: If 1+rL  is null, then do the next step; otherwise, 
set 1+= rr  and repeat Step 6 to 8. 
Step 9: Construct the association rules for all large q -

After step 10, the rules constructed are output and can 
act as the meta-knowledge for the given transaction. It is 
expressed based on reasoning and is easy to be understood. 
IV. APPLICATION 
Based on the history data of a 600MW power plant unit, 
typical parameters which are related to combustion 
optimization are analyzed. The selected parameters include 
boiler load, coefficient of coal quality, ratio of air and fuel 
flow f(x), O2 content, boiler efficiency, NOx emission. 
Among of these parameters, coefficient of coal quality is a 
parameter constructed approximately reflecting quality of 
fuel, which can be calculated by unit load/total fuel flow. 
Based on the steady condition, a total of 986 transactions 
consisted of parameters in different load condition in recent 
four months are obtained, which is shown in table 1.

Unit load follows the demand of AGC (Automatic 
Generation Control) in China and it varies in a large range. 
Cluster method is employed to classify the load data and 
(300MW-600MW) load range is divided into ten clusters: 
[299.8?312.59]? [320.23?340.3]? [347.24?375.6]?
[377.24 ? 410.04] ? [420.07 ? 440.74] ? [449.18 ?
475.32]?[477.7?511.83]?[517.73?551.69]?[555.29?
584.19]?[584.68?601.61]. Then, in every load cluster, 
fuzzy association rule algorithm is applied to analyzing 
history data and rules like Load(Li): Parameter 
1(Pi),…,Parameter n(Ti)  Target 1(Mi), Target 2(Ni) can 
be obtained. 
Taking load cluster [584.68? 601.61] for example, 
optimal rules for combustion optimization are extracted. 
The minimum support value is set at 0.15 and the minimum 
confidence value is set at 50%. The membership function of 
the O2 content is shown in fig 2. Other parameters’ 
membership functions are similar with this one. 
?
Figure 2. The membership function of the O2 content 
The output of association rule algorithm is as follows: 
when boiler efficiency is [93.7, 94.2] and NOx emission is 
[540.4, 709.95], ratio f(x) is [4.36, 4.97] and O2 content is 
[2.37, 2.64], with a support value of 0.186 and a confidence 
value of 57%. It satisfies the requirement of minimum 
support and minimum confidence. This rule means that: 
when the load is in [584.68?601.61]MW, boiler efficiency 
is very high and NOx emission is lower, optimal range of 
ratio f(x) and O2 content are respectively 4.36~4.97 and 
2.37~2.64. By using the average method, optimal setpoints 
of these two parameters can be set at 4.67 and 2.51%. 
The obtained setpoints of ratio of air and fuel flow and 
O2 content in different load cluster was applied to the control 
system in fig 1. And the performance of boiler was improved 
obviously. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Combustion optimization is the mainly method to 
improve boiler performance and decision of air and fuel 
parameters’ optimal values is the key point in combustion 
optimization. In this paper, fuzzy sets theory is introduced 
into the association mining process in order to soften the 
partition boundary of the domain and generalize the data. 
And then, fuzzy association rule algorithm is employed to 
find optimization setpoint values of important parameters of 
combustion process. Based on history data in power plant, 
the obtained optimization values are reachable in operation 
and easy to guide operation.
