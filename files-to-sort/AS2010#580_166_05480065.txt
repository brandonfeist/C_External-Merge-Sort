Abstract— As faculty members it is part of our job, in 
conjunction with local and/or National government regulations, 
our institutional rules, regulations and guidance and our faculty 
Industry advisory committees, to design and deliver appropriate 
degree programmes to our students.  But what is appropriate and 
does our thinking align with that of the students we educate?  
This paper presents a project that set out to investigate the 
alignment of the perception of the importance (to future careers) 
and level of development of a large set of generic and specific 
competences.  The target group for the project was Electrical and 
Information Engineering (EIE) students, faculty and employers 
across Europe.  The body undertaking this project was the 
European Association for Education in Electrical Engineering as 
part of the European Union funded EIE-Surveyor project.  In 
total, 3,275 completed questionnaires were analyzed and analyses 
have been carried out by gender, academic study level, country 
and by competence both individually and in groups they for 
through the application of standard statistical data reduction 
techniques.  This paper introduces the project and its 
background and explains the research methodology and analyses 
employed.  It shows key results and their impact and provides a 
set of recommendations for future related work.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Electrical and Information Engineering (EIE) discipline 
area has been the focus of attention for the European 
Association for Education in Electrical and Information 
Engineering (EAEEIE) [1] since its inception 20 years ago.  As 
an Association, it dedicates itself to all matters relating to 
education at the Higher Education level, in the EIE area.  Since 
1996 it has successfully won a series of European Union 
Thematic Network projects to investigate aspects of EIE 
education and to share and disseminate findings and best 
practice.  
This paper presents findings from part of the EU funded 
EIE-Surveyor project [2], the third project undertaken by the 
EAEEIE.  The project was a review included a survey of the 
perceptions of the generic competences that higher education 
degree qualifications develop in students.  In particular it 
reviewed the perception of importance and level of 
development of 32 generic competences for the key 
stakeholders, faculty, employers and the students themselves.  
This paper introduces the project and its background, the 
research methodology and analyses employed.   
By way of introduction, this section starts with a brief 
introduction to the EAEEIE, the EIE-Surveyor project and the 
survey activity and to the Tuning Methodology [3], which 
underpins the methodology used in this project.   
A. EIE-Surveyor Project 
The EIE-Surveyor Project was a Thematic Network project 
funded by the EU between 2006 and 2008.  The project had 
more than 110 HE partners from across Europe. The main 
objectives of the project are 
1. Reflection on generic competences and subject- specific
 competences in Electrical and Engineering (EIE) 
Information 
2. Implementation assessment educational available in EIE of 
quality on some resources 
3. Reflection and proposition of a methodology for 
accreditation, in order to enhance comparability and 
common certification procedures 
4. Proposition of a census of the existing curricula in EIE in 
Europe, the multinational degrees, and the situation of the 
implementation of the Bologna-process in our fields, at the 
bachelor, master and PhD levels. 
As indicated above one of the EIE- Surveyor main 
activities is the application of the TUNING methodology to 
EIE with the objective of improving understanding of the 
generic and subject-specific competences in the EIE discipline 
area.

B. Tuning Methodology 
The Tuning project was generally concerned with the 
implementation of the Bologna Process at university level.  It 
proposed output-oriented programmes based on learning 
outcomes expressed in terms of generic and subject-generic 
competences as well as on ECTS workload-based credits.  
The name of the project “Tuning” was chosen to express 
the idea that universities are not attempting the harmonization 
of their degree programmes or planning to implement any sort 
of unified, prescriptive or definitive European curricula. They 
are more interested in establishing reference points and 
encouraging convergence and common understanding. 
According to the Tuning methodology attention is devoted 
to the concept of profile that should be based on a process of 
consultation with the most significant stakeholders for the 
degree programme. These stakeholders are academics, 
students, employers and professional organizations. The latter 
three groups represent an important link to the needs of society. 
Formal university bodies as well as the academic faculty 
involved must ultimately be responsible for the realization of 
each programme. 
The Tuning project established a methodology designed to 
understand curricula and to make them comparable. It 
comprises five lines of approach: 
• Generic (general academic) competences  
• Subject-specific competences  
• The role of ECTS as an accumulation system  
• Approaches to learning, teaching, and assessment and  
• The role of quality enhancement in the educational 
process (emphasizing systems based on internal 
institutional quality culture). 
The first application of the Tuning Methodology was in 
Business, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Education, European 
Studies, History, Mathematics, Nursing and Physics. 
C. Survey Activity 
The EIE-Surveyor project focused on the first three lines of 
this methodology and this paper focuses very specifically on 
the first line, generic competences. The objective of the 
application of the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline 
area was to explore the alignment of the competences of EIE 
graduate with employers as the users of the end product of 
study programmes; of academics who are instrumental in the 
design of the curricula; and students as ‘customers’ of the 
programmes. A more detailed description of approach taken in 
given in the methodology section. Before this it is perhaps 
important to clarify what degree titles are included in the EIE 
discipline area, as this is not clearly bounded.  
D. The EIE Discipline area 
The titles Electrical and Information Engineering are broad 
and somewhat ‘fuzzy’ terms. As was found in the creation of 
the EIE-Surveyor first cycle degree programme monograph [4], 
there are many different academic programmes that clearly fall 
within common understanding of the terms and many that lie at 
its boundary. For the purposes of this project the definition of 
EIE has been aligned with the EIE Surveyor monograph 
definition that is encapsulated in a set of degree programme 
titles. These embrace Electrical and Electronic Engineering as 
would be expected. They embrace Information Engineering 
where it is of an electronic or computer science nature, and 
Computer Science. Excluded would be information engineering 
where it is directly and predominantly orientated towards 
information in the media (news, television, etc.) 
Subjects such as Media Technology, Communications 
(again where electronic in nature), Control, Aerospace, 
Mechatronics, and so on are included where the electrical or 
electronic technical content predominates. Subjects such as 
Business Management are included where it is a minor 
component (typically 25% or less) of a technical degree. 
The broadness of the discipline introduces the potential 
problems of comparing engineering subjects with more science 
(e.g. Computer Science) orientated subjects. This aspect is not 
included in this report but could be the subject of a more 
focussed study on the overall dataset in the future. 
II. METHODOLOGY 
The objective of the study was to quantify the importance 
of a set of generic competences to the respondent’s future and 
the level to which they feel the competence is being developed, 
make comparisons and draw conclusions from the responses 
obtained. 
The general process followed was to produce an initial set 
of questions, create a set of pilot questionnaires, carry out a 
small pilot study, make appropriate modifications and then 
launch the full survey. This section describes this process in 
more detail and explains the rationale to the approach at each 
stage. 
From the Tuning Methodology report it was clear that a set 
of the generic competences had been developed and used 
consistently across the studies carried out prior to the Surveyor 
project. The set of generic competences (32 in total) was 
discussed for applicability to the EIE area by the task team and 
it was agreed they should be used unchanged. Space was, 
however, added for additional competences respondents view 
as important as respondents complete the questionnaire. 
The Tuning Methodology approach of using a 4-point 
Likert scale for the importance and level of development of 
each competence was retained.  
To illustrate, the first generic competence is “Capacity for 
analysis and synthesis”. Respondents were asked to rate how 
important this is to them on a 4-point scale where 1 represents 
“none’, 2 “weak”, 3 “considerable” and 4 “strong”. They were 
then asked to indicate how well they feel “Capacity for analysis 
and synthesis” is being developed in their degree programme, 
also on a 1 to 4 scale with exactly the same meaning for each 
response number. The responses could only be 1, 2, 3 or 4. 
As an introduction to the questionnaire a set of general 
questions were asked of all respondents to capture their gender, 
age band, position in the organisation, country, etc. 
68
Different questionnaires were created, one for students, one 
for academics, and one for employers. The wording in each 
questionnaire was adjusted to make the whole questionnaire 
appropriate to the ‘stakeholder’ and to capture the important 
general information about them. Information not relevant to a 
particular stakeholder was removed to avoid confusion.  
The initial questionnaires were pilot tested in a small 
number of institutions on a small sample to test the logic, 
instructions and wording and to assess the completion time. 
Following the pilot study changes were made to the wording to 
improve clarity and ease of completion.  
A number of questionnaire delivery mechanisms were 
proposed. An online website was created for direct electronic 
entry. Electronic versions of the questionnaire were created for 
sending to potential respondents by email and finally paper 
versions were made available. 
It was accepted that there would be a trade off between 
response rate and the collection method and that a difference 
method would suit different collection approaches. For 
maximum flexibility all collections methods were offered. 
In the final form each questionnaire starts with an 
introductory page containing a brief overview of the objective 
of the study and the questionnaire and who the supporting body 
is. It then makes a statement about confidentiality and data 
protection and gave a name and contact details for more 
information. Finally there is a general instruction on how to 
complete the questionnaire. 
Responses into the online website were collated into a set of 
Excel compatible spreadsheets. Paper and electronically 
completed responses were manually entered. All data were 
merged into a single SPSS data file. The responses for the 
different stakeholders being identified by a questionnaire code 
field. Each response was also given a unique reference code. 
A code book defining all the variable names and attributes 
was designed for the data set before the SPSS data file was 
created and was then updated as the analysis was undertaken. 
The primary objective of this study is, in line with the 
Tuning methodology, to quantitatively assess the alignment of 
the supply and demand equation in the EIE discipline. Specific 
within this is the alignment of the generic competences. In 
addition to these questions two subsidiary research questions 
were addressed: 
• What are the most important competences for each 
respondent group? 
• Do the generic competences group to form meaningful 
and usable clusters?  
The primary research questions and the above subsidiary 
ones were tested using a combination of descriptive statistical 
methods, factor analysis and correlation tests. 
The EIE-Surveyor project had participants of almost every 
European Country and all project partners were asked to 
sample students, faculty and employers in the EIE area. 
III. RESULTS 
A total of 3,275 completed questionnaires were returned.  
Of these 81.1% were from students, 3.4% employers, and 5.7% 
academics.  Responses were received from 26 different 
European countries although many returned small numbers that 
are insufficient to allow country based analyses. 9 countries 
returned over 200 responses.  
2,691 student questionnaires were returned of which 2,641 
stated their gender. Of these 14.5% were female and 85.5% 
male.  74.3% of the students were studying First Cycle degrees, 
24.8% Masters level and 0.9% were at the Doctoral/PhD level.  
As might be expected 99.0% were from individuals in the 
‘conventional’ (under 30) age range for students. 
A. The student view of generic competences 
Table 1 shows, in descending order of magnitude, the mean 
importance of the top and bottom 5 generic competences for all 
students. In the mean column 4 is the highest score (indicating 
“strong”). Note that the lowest ranked competence still has a 
mean of 2.52, midway between “weak” and “considerable” – 
hence no generic competence is really considered very low in 
importance. 
Table 1 shows that “Problem Solving” is rated as the most 
important competence by students and that “Understanding of 
cultures and customs of other countries” is rated least 
important. A look at the order of the means by gender does not 
show any material differences (all differences are small and not 
statistically significant). Further, a look at the order between 
Bachelor and Master level students also shows few differences. 
Overall the position of some of the generic competences 
merits comment:   
• The competences usually associated with 
enterprise/entrepreneurship (“Initiative and 
entrepreneurial spirit” and “Patents and Intellectual 
Property Rights”) tend to lie to the bottom of the list

with only “Capacity for generating new ideas 
(creativity)” being ranked important (7th in the list).  
• All competences associated with internationalism 
(“Ability to work in an international context”, 
“International Relations and Collaborations”, 
“Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality”, and 
“Understanding of cultures and customs of other 
countries”) all score low. “Knowledge of a second 
language” lies midway in the list. Overall this 
placement should be a concern for mobility generally.  
•  “Research skills” is rated low in the list, a concern for 
those institutions with aspirations towards developing 
their students into future research careers. That said 
there may be many reasons for this particular 
placement, current year of study possibly being one.   
Table 2 shows, in descending order of magnitude, the mean 
level of development of the top and bottom 5 generic 
competences for all students. Here again 4 is the highest score 
(indicating “strong”).  
Note that the lowest ranked competence has a mean of 2.03, 
or “weak”. Students clearly feel that the level of development 
of, in particular “Understanding of cultures and customs of 
other countries” is weak on average across Europe.   
Table 2 shows that “Elementary computing skills” is rated 
as the best developed competence by students. This is perhaps, 
for some, a disappointment as the development of elementary 
computing skills is not a learning objective in all higher 
education institutions and is probably a competence assumed in 
the student body. 
Second in the list is “Problem Solving”, a competence that 
probably does appear in the learning objectives of academic 
programmes in the EIE discipline and is top of the list of rated 
importance by students – so there is an immediate and clear 
indicator of good alignment between student rating of 
importance and their view on how well it is developed in them.

A look at the order of the means by gender does not show 
any material differences (all differences are small and not 
statistically significant). Further, a look at the order between 
Bachelor and Master level students also shows few differences. 
“Problem Solving” is rated most important and second most 
well developed of all the generic competences, suggesting a 
small ‘gap’ in how students need is being met. This notion of 
‘gap’ can be quantified by looking at the numerical difference 
between the rated importance and level of development for 
each generic competence. The algorithm used is:  
Difference = Rated importance – Level of development  
Given that both rated importance and level of development 
are in the range 1..4, the valid range of the difference is -3..+3 
and a positive difference indicates that the rated importance is 
greater than the level of development – or students need is 
greater than what they are receiving.  
Table 3 shows the ‘gap’ for all students and for males and 
females separately for the top and bottom 5 generic 
competences.  
Across all students “Knowledge of a second language” is 
top of the ‘gap’ list. This indicates that academic institutions (at 
least those involved in this survey) are, on average, not 
delivering this competence to the level the students rate it as 
important. The next few at the top of the list are “Ability to 
work in an international context”, “Capacity for generating new 
ideas (creativity)” , “Leadership”, “International Relations and 
Collaborations”, and “Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit”. 
These generally group to entrepreneurialism and 
internationalism and the results suggest academic institutions 
could be doing more in these two areas.  Overall the differences 
between the genders is small and not statistically significant 
however there are important differences between levels of study.

In Table 3 the competences shown in bold italics are where 
there is a statistically significant difference between the 
Bachelor and Master level responses. The direction of the 
difference can be understood by looking at the value of the 
means. 
There are some significant differences between the study 
levels. “Knowledge of a second language” is top at both levels. 
At Master level students consider “International Relations and 
Collaborations” in the top 5 along with “Capacity for applying 
knowledge in practice”. This suggests that at Masters level 
capacity of applying knowledge in practice, for example, with a 
larger gap, is either being taken for granted at this level or is 
not being developed as much as the pure theoretical aspects of 
the discipline. Students clearly perceive the need for knowing 
how to apply this knowledge in practice. 
There are some differences between countries with, for 
example, the difference in “International Relations and 
Collaborations” being 1.1 in France, 0.81 in Poland, 0.63 in 
Greece, 0.58 in the Slovak Republic and 0.39 in Hungary.  
This shows that there is diversity across Europe in either the 
perception of importance of the competence or the amount to 
which is it developed in each country.  It also suggests a lack 
of homogeneity in the results – a more serious consequence as 
is considered more in the discussion section. 
B. The acadmic view of generic competences 
The 189 completed questionnaires returned by academics 
show they rate all but 8 of the generic competences to be of 
“considerable” importance or stronger. The most important is 
“Elementary computing skills” with “Capacity for applying 
knowledge in practice” and “Problem solving” very close 
behind in joint second place. It is interesting to note that these 
top three are also the top three for all students. The least 
important competence is “Understanding of cultures and 
customs of other countries” again in agreement with the views 
of all students.  
There are statistically significant differences between the 
rated importance of 5 generic competences between the First 
and Second Cycle Degrees. In all 5 cases the mean at the 
Bachelor level is higher than that at the Master level indicating 
academics feel the competences are more important for study 
at the Bachelor level. The difference in “Leadership” and 
“Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality” are both of 
medium effect size [3], the other three, “Decision making”, 
“Interpersonal skills” and “Understanding of cultures and 
customs of other countries” are small. 
Table 4 shows the rating of level of development of the 
generic competences for all academics.  There is an important 
difference between the ratings of level of development between 
academics and their students.  The academics consider 
technical aspects of their programmes to be being developed 
more than the general ones of “Problem solving”, “Capacity to 
learn” and “Teamworking”. 
Table 5 shows the gap between rated importance and level 
of development.

Academics consider knowledge of a second language to be 
the competence with the highest mismatch between rated 
importance and level of development. Interestingly this is the 
same as for students. Next is ability to work in an 
interdisciplinary team. This competence is ranked 17th of all the 
generic competences with a mean of 3.22 – above 
“considerable”. Academics clearly recognize the value of this 
competence in their students but perhaps do not have the 
opportunity to develop it within their own institutions. Initiative 
and entrepreneurial spirit are next highest in ‘gap’ followed by 
“planning and time management” and “capacity to adapt to 
new situations”. Planning and time management is not ranked 
very high in the overall importance ranking (19th out of 32) yet 
is an important general student study skill.

The competences at the bottom of the list indicate the 
smallest gap between importance and level of development 
indicating that their development is closely matched to need. 
Interestingly all gaps are positive indicating rated importance is 
higher than level of development (on the same rating scale) in 
all cases. 
There is some variation in the ranking of the ‘gap’ across 
Europe. For example, in Bulgaria the top 5 ranked gaps are: 
 
1. “Planning and time management” 
2.  “Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team” 
3.  “Knowledge of a second language” 
4.  “Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit” 
5.  “Oral and written communications in your native 
language” 
 
For French academics Capacity for generating new ideas 
(creativity)” is top with “Knowledge of a second language” 
second. Irish academics rank “Capacity to adapt to new 
situations” top. 
 
C. The employer view of generic competences 
The 112 completed questionnaires returned by employers 
show a slightly different view to students and academics.  In 
the top 5 ranking of importance of the generic competences are 
“Problem Solving”, “Team working” and “Capacity for 
applying knowledge in practice” in common with students and 
academics but also “Concern for quality” and “Capacity to 
learn”.  Both understandable from an industrial perspective.  
Employers, like students rated “Elementary computing 
skills” first in terms of level of development followed by 
“Capacity to learn”, an encouraging result for HEIs.  “Oral and 
written communications in your native language” came third 
followed by “Will to succeed” and “Basic general technical 
knowledge of the profession of your work area”.  Surprisingly 
“Planning and time management” can in the bottom 5 – this 
should be a concern for HEIs as most of us expect good 
demonstration of this competence in examination preparation, 
individual and group projects and general assignment work. 
Table 6 shows the employers rating of the ‘gap’ in the 
generic competences.   
Top of the list overall is “Concern for quality”. This is 
dominated by a clear difference at the Masters level. At the 
Bachelor level the greatest gap is in “Teamworking”. “Planning 
and time management” is second overall, again principally 
because of the Master level responses, it is ranked 6th for 
Bachelor students. It is clear from the top few in the list where 
employers feel the academic programmes their graduate 
recruits have taken are falling short of their “need” in the 
generic competences.

Encouragingly at the bottom of the list there appears to be 
no issue with Elementary computing skills although the 
academics who feel that this is not a core component of their 
degree programme will gain little comfort from this outcome. 
The other competences at the bottom of the Table 6 are generic 
competences employers feel are being developed in line with 
their rating of its importance. 
There is variation in the way employers in different 
countries rate the gap between importance and level of 
development of the generic competences. The top ranked gap 
is: 
• Bulgaria: “Capacity for applying knowledge in 
practice”, “Decision making”, “Leadership” (equal top) 
• France: “Capacity to adapt to new situations”, 
“Teamworking” (equal top) 
• Germany: “Planning and time management” 
• Ireland: “Teamworking” 
• Poland: “Planning and time management” 
• Slovak Republic: “Ability to work autonomously” 
IV. HOW THE GENERIC COMPETENCES GROUP 
Factorial analysis was used to ‘group’ the generic 
competences.  Across all the responses the 32 generic 
competences factored into 5 groups: 
1. “Internationalisation”: “Understanding of cultures and 
customs of other countries.” “Appreciation of ethical 
issues.” “Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality”, 
“International relations and collaborations”, “Ability to 
work in an international context”

Table 7 shows the mean importance of each group of 
competences by stakeholder group for the First Cycle Degree 
respondents. For the employers the personal skills are the most 
importance group followed by professional skills and 
interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank 
internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics 
agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of 
them more strongly important than employers. Students also 
rank the competence groups in the same order but rate 
internationalisation slightly higher than employers and 
entrepreneurship very slightly lower. 
Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas 
shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are 
the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal 
skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the 
Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are 
developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the 
rated importance and level of development of these groups in 
that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the 
Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than 
that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the 
generic competences is quite well aligned. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning 
Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment 
between the views of the importance and level of development 
of sets of competences between students, academics and 
employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning 
Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these 
subjects.

In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the 
stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The 
number of responses from each country is variable and a full by 
country analysis is not possible with the responses currently 
available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out.  
Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all 
countries show that there are country differences in some 
analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further 
investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are 
aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering 
problems. This too is a topic of further investigation. 
The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn 
from the analyses presented. 
Consistent top of importance of the generic competences 
for all stakeholders is “Problem solving”. Second in the ranking 
for students is “Elementary computing skills”. Comparatively 
students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is 
taken for granted in students than in academics and employers. 
The results show employers value it more than students and 
this message could be communicated to students. 
A number of gaps exist between the importance and level 
of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is 
“Knowledge of a second language” and the evidence from the 
languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at 
English. 
The generic competences group into 5 sets with “Personal 
skills” rated consistently as the most important set. This is 
followed, in descending order of importance, by “Professional 
skills”, “Interpersonal skills”, “Internationalisation” and 
“Entrepreneurship”. The smallest mean “Internationalisation” 
is just over midway between “weak” and “considerable”. Given 
the European Union’s desire to see greater student and 
employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for 
scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by 
curriculum designers. 
Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in 
the finding that “Professional skills” are the best developed of 
the skill groups followed by “Personal skills” and 
“Interpersonal skills”. This not only aligns with the views of 
employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real 
purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a 
trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large 
firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise 
culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact 
that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps 
merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula. 
In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and 
level of development on average differently. This difference 
has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The 
general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives 
and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the 
relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In 
general and even allowing for this employers and academics 
tend to rate competences higher in importance than students 
and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are 
drawn out in section 8.
