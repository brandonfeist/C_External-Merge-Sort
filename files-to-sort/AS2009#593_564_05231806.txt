Abstract 
 
In this paper, we propose an algorithm for mining 
the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules to discover 
the strong correlations between a specific telecom 
service and other services from a telecom database. 
We show how, by using the fuzzy statistics analysis, the 
target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules can be obtained 
from a given database. Our work can assist the 
telecom service provider in finding the services highly 
related to the most popular telecom service. This kind 
of information is quite useful for the telecom service 
provider to provide the appropriate services to their 
customers for effective churn management. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In telecommunications industry, which changed 
from a rapidly growing market into a fierce competition 
and saturated market, suffers a critical issue of the 
customers who are easily to change a telecom service 
provider to another ones. For telecommunications 
industry, however, acquiring a new customer will pay 
much higher costs than retaining an existing one, and 
thus, decreasing the churn rate has become more and 
more important. The goal of churn management is not 
only to discover the customers who might be lost but 
also provide them the correct services they want. Thus, 
to effective churn management, a useful technique for 
finding the telecom services which the customers really 
want is needed. 
In all data mining techniques, mining association 
rules is often defined as finding the itemsets which 
frequently occur together in a given dataset [1, 2, 10, 
12]. The general form of an association rule is ,BA?  
where A and B are two itemsets, and ?=BA . A wide 
application of mining association rules is to identify the 
customers’ behaviors in various business databases. 
For example, in telecommunications industry, mining 
association rules can help us to extract the sets of the 
telecom services which are frequently used by the same 
customers in the telecom database. Clearly, this kind of 
information is useful for understanding the popular sets 
of the telecom services which they provide for their 
customers. However, two services which are frequently 
used by the same customers can not always imply that 
there exists a strong relationship between them. For 
example, assume that a telecom service S  is popular 
and used almost by all customers, then the service S is 
very likely used with other services frequently by the 
some customers, but in fact, the relationships between 
this service and other services may be not strong. Thus, 
mining association rules may generate some misleading 
information for a telecom service provider to provide 
appropriate services to their customers. In this case, 
mining the correlation rules may be a good way to find 
the telecom services which the customers really want. 
Mining correlation rules is a procedure of finding 
the itemsets which are highly related to each other from 
a given dataset [4, 10, 12]. However, in practical 
telecom databases, data are not only described by 
binary values but also are described by quantitative 
ones, such as the number of times that a customer used 
in a period time, waiting to be explored, therefore, 
methods for discovering the correlation rules from 
these quantitative data are also needed. For avoiding 
the shape boundary problem, the concept of fuzzy set 
theory [17] is commonly used in this case to transform 
these quantitative data into the fuzzy items or the fuzzy 
attributes, and this kind of fuzzy rule is called the fuzzy 
correlation rule.  
To discover the services which the customers really 
want, we propose an algorithm for mining the target-

oriented fuzzy correlation rules to focus on finding the 
strong correlations between the most popular service 
and other services according to the numbers of times 
that the customers used. Our work can help the telecom 
service provider to retain the telecom services highly 
related to the most popular service. In this paper, we 
show how, by using the fuzzy statistics analysis, the 
target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules can be obtained 
from the given database. The rest of this paper is 
organized as follows: Some basic concepts involved in 
mining the fuzzy correlation rules are introduced in 
section 2. The proposed algorithm for mining the 
target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules is presented in 
section 3. An experiment is displayed in section 4. The 
conclusions are given in section 5. 
 
2. Preliminaries 
 
Some basic concepts involved in mining the fuzzy 
correlation rules are introduced in this section. 
 
2.1. Fuzzy association rule 
 
Mining fuzzy association rules is the task of finding 
the fuzzy itemsets which frequently occur together 
from the given database [3, 5, 7-14]. 
Let },,,{ 21 mfffF = be a set of fuzzy items, =T  
),,,{ 21 nttt  be a set of fuzzy records, and each fuzzy 
record it  is represented as a vector with m  values, 
),(),(( 21 ii tftf  )),(, im tf  where )( ij tf  is the degree 
that fuzzy item jf appears in record ?)(, iji tft  ].1,0[  
Then, a fuzzy association rule is defined as an 
implication form, such as ?AF ,BF  where FFF BA ?,  
are two fuzzy itemsets, and .BbballAaaall FfFf ?????  A 
fuzzy association rule BA FF ? holds in T with the 
fuzzy support, }),,({ BA FFfsupp and with the fuzzy 
confidence, )( BA FFfconf ? [9]. 
The fuzzy support and the fuzzy confidence of the 
fuzzy association rule, BA FF ? , are defined as follows: 
n

BA
BA Ffsupp
FFfsuppFFfconf =?            (2) 
If the }),({ BA FFfsupp is greater than or equal to the 
predefined threshold, minimal fuzzy support, and the 
)( BA FFfconf ? is also greater than or equal to the 
predefined threshold, minimal fuzzy confidence, and 
then the fuzzy association rule, ?AF ,BF  is considered 
an interesting fuzzy association rule. 
 
2.2. Fuzzy correlation rule 
 
While the task of mining fuzzy association rules 
concerns the co-occurrence of the fuzzy itemsets, the 
task of mining fuzzy correlation rules focuses on the 
correlation relationships among the fuzzy itemsets. In 
previous researches [15, 16], we have presented an 
algorithm to discover fuzzy correlation rules by using 
the fuzzy simple correlation analysis [6]. 
Assume that },,,{ 21 mfffF = is a set of fuzzy items; 
),,,{ 21 ntttT = is a fuzzy dataset with n records, and 
each record it  is represented as a vector with m values, 
)),(,),(),(( 21 imii tftftf  where )( ij tf is the degree that 
fuzzy item jf occurs in record ].1,0[)(, ?iji tft  Then, 
the form of a fuzzy correlation rule is ,BA FF ? where

T with the fuzzy support, }),,({ BA FFfsupp and with the 
fuzzy confidence, ),( BA FFfconf ? and with the fuzzy 
simple correlation coefficient, .
,BAr  
The fuzzy support and the fuzzy confidence of 
,BA FF ? are the same as of a fuzzy association rule. 
The fuzzy simple correlation coefficient of BA FF ?  is 
defined as follows:

Similarly, if the }),({ BA FFfsupp of BA FF ? is 
greater than or equal to the minimal fuzzy support; the 
)( BA FFfconf ? of BA FF ?  is greater than or equal 
to the minimal fuzzy confidence; the BAr , of BA FF ?  is 
also greater than or equal to a predefined threshold, 
called the minimal fuzzy correlation coefficient, and 
then the fuzzy correlation rule, ,BA FF ?  is considered 
an interesting fuzzy correlation rule as well. 
 
3. Target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules 
 
To discover the strong correlations between a 
popular telecom service and other telecom services 
according to the numbers of times that the customers 
used, we propose an algorithm for mining the target-
oriented fuzzy correlation rules. A target-oriented fuzzy 
correlation rule is a fuzzy correlation rule with a fuzzy 
item we specify. In this section, we show how, by using 
the fuzzy statistics analysis, the target-oriented fuzzy 
correlation rules can be obtained from a given database. 
Assume that },,,{ 21 mfffF = be a set of fuzzy items, 
and tF  is the target fuzzy item of F ; ),,,{ 21 ntttT =  
be a fuzzy dataset with n  records, and each sample 
record it  is represented as a vector with m  values, 
)),(,),(),(( 21 imii tftftf  where )( ij tf is the degree of 
the fuzzy item jf belongs to record it , )( ij tf  ? ]1,0[ . 
Before staring the algorithm, three user-predefined 
thresholds ,,,, fff rcs need to be determined, where fs  
is the minimal fuzzy support, fc is the minimal fuzzy 
confidence, fr  is the minimal fuzzy simple correlation 
coefficient. The details of the algorithm are described 
as follows: 
Step 1: For each fuzzy item Ff j ? , the value of 
)( jfS is computed.

Step 2: Let 1L be the set of the fuzzy items whose 
value of )( jfS  is greater than or equal to fs .  
TF  is the fuzzy item with the largest value of 
)( jfS . 
Step 3: Let TFLL ?= 1
'
1 . 
Step 4: Let 2C  be the set of the combinations of  
'
1L  
joint with .TF   }.|),{( '12 LFFFC ATA ?=  
Step 5: For each member of ,2C say ),,( TA FF the 
value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ TA FFfsupp  
and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation 
coefficient, ,
,tAr are computed respectively by 
formula (1) and by formula (3). 
Step 6: Let 2L is the set of the members of 2C  whose 
fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to 
fs and fuzzy simple correlation coefficients 
are greater than or equal to .fr  
Step 7: Let '2C be the set of the combinations of 
'
1L  
joint with .'1L  ,,|),{( '1'2 LFFFFC CBCB ?=  
}.CB FF ?  
Step 8: For each member of ,'2C say ),,( CB FF the 
value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ CB FFfsupp  
and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation 
coefficient, ,
,CBr are computed respectively 
by formula (1) and by formula (3) as well. 
Step 9: Let '2L is the set of the members of 
'
2C  whose 
fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to 
fs and fuzzy simple correlation coefficients 
are greater than or equal to .fr  
Step 10: Generate each ,3, ?kCk  by
'
1L  joint with 
.1?kL  Assume that DF is a member of 
'
1L ; 
),( FE FF  is a member of ;1?kL  the size of EF  
is .e If ),( DE FF  is a member of 1?kL or ' 1?kL , 
then the combination )},,({ FDE FFF is a 
member of kC . Similarly, if ),( DF FF  is a 
member of
ekL ? or ,'ekL ? then the combination 
}),{,( DFE FFF is also a member of kC . 
Step 11: For each member of ,kC say ),,( GF FF the 
value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ GF FFfsupp  
and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation 
coefficient, ,
,GFr are computed respectively 
by formula (1) and by formula (3). 
Step 12: Let kL is the set of the members of kC  
whose fuzzy supports are greater than or 
equal to fs and fuzzy simple correlation 
coefficients are greater than or equal to .fr  
Step 13: Generate each ,3,' ?kCk  by
'
1?kL  joint with 
401
.'
1?kL  Assume that ),( QP FF and ),( RP FF  are 
two members of ;' 1?kL the size of PF  is ;p  
the size of the union set },,{, RQ FF is a ;pk ?  
and then the combination }),{,( RQP FFF  is a 
member of kC . 
Step 14: For each member of ,'kC say ),,( YX FF the 
value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ YX FFfsupp  
and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation 
coefficient, ,
,YXr are computed respectively 
by formula (1) and by formula (3). 
Step 15: Let 'kL is the set of the members of 
'
kC  
whose fuzzy supports are greater than or 
equal to fs and fuzzy simple correlation 
coefficients are greater than or equal to .fr  
Step 16: Repeat step 10 to step 15, until next ' 1+kC  is 
an empty set. 
Step 17: For each number of ,2, ?kLk say ),,( ZW FF  
two candidate fuzzy correlation rules with 
,TF ZW FF ? and ,WZ FF ? can be generated.  
If the fuzzy confidence of a candidate rule is 
greater than or equal to fc , then this fuzzy 
correlation rule is considered an interesting 
rule. 
 
4. Experiment 
 
A simple dataset sampling from a real telecom 
database is shown in Table 1. Each entry ijt of Table 1 
is the number of times per month that the customer Cidi 
used the telecom service Sj averaged over eight months. 
Before starting the procedure of mining the target-
oriented fuzzy correlation rules from this dataset, the 
thresholds need to be determined in advance. Here, fs  
is set to 0.25, fc is set to 0.80, fr is set to 0.30.  First, 
we use the formula (14) to determine the degrees of 
interesting to the telecom services for each customer, 
and transform the Table 1 into Table 2. Therefore, each 
entry ijt of the Table 2 is the degree of interesting that 
the customer Cidi used the telecom service Sj.

From the rule (15), we can see that there is a strong 
relationship between telecom services { 1S , 3S } and 
telecom service 2S . In addition, the rule (16) show us 
that there is a strong relationship between telecom 
services { 1S , 2S } and telecom service 3S . In original 
telecom database, 1S represents the dramatic service; 
2S  represents the adult service; 3S  represents the sport 
service. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
In this paper, to discover the strong correlations 
between a specific telecom service and other services, 
we propose an algorithm for mining the target-oriented 
fuzzy correlation rules. Our experimental results can 
find out the services highly related to the most popular 
telecom service. Of course, this kind of information is 
quite useful for the telecom service provider to provide 
the appropriate services to their customers and remove 
useless services to reach effective churn management in 
telecommunications industry.
