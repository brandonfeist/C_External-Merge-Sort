Intelligent User Search Behaviour Knowledge Discovery
Yun Shen and Trevor Martin, Member, IEEE
Abstract—It is important for Web search engine providers to
study user behaviour in order to have a better understanding
of how customers interact with search engines so that they
can improve users’ overall search experience. However, user
behaviour in a search engine is complicated and affected by
various factors, e.g. query length, intention/context/time when
queries are submitted, etc. It is interesting to find answers to
questions such as “whether loyal users are more likely to issue
short length queries or medium length queries? If so, is that
behaviour linked with high click through rate or is it linked
with the user’s previous search experience?” In this paper we
argue that user behaviour should be better analysed from a
subjective angle and introduce a granular analysis algorithm
to intelligently extract user behaviour knowledge in a human-
centric way to answer above questions. We study six variables
relating to user behaviour study and demonstrate how fuzzy
association rules mining based on mass assignment theory can
intelligently analyse user activity patterns in a large scale Web
search log data set.
I. INTRODUCTION
The success of a search engine relies on the number of its
customers. It is thus important for search engine providers
to have a better understanding of how the customers interact
with the search engine so that they can improve users’ over-
all search experience, consequently, growing their customer
populations. Web search log at the service provider side
records how users interact with the search engine by retaining
information about user queries, time stamp, IP addresses,
web browser types, devices, etc. Naturally such log file is
the most important source to directly study and understand
user search behaviour.
There are two major research directions on analysing
user search behaviour: one is modelling user behaviour
collectively with the assumption that users who had similar
behaviour in the past are likely to have similar behaviour in
the future; another research direction focuses on modelling
individual search behaviour or grouping queries/session ac-
cording to certain criteria. We focus on collective user
behaviour in this paper.
Most of previous research on user behaviour analysis
proposed statistical methods to conduct studies on user be-
haviour with a focus on a specific goal such as ranking algo-
rithms enhancement [1], spam detection [2], predicting user
next action, behavioural targeting advertisement [3], brows-
ing/email behaviour [4], [5], [6], [7], document relevance
[8], query grouping [9] etc. However, there are considerable
number of subjective factors that are associated with user

behaviour when interacting with the search engine, e.g. query
length, user reaction to visual layout of the returned results,
intention/context/time linked with a user when submitting
queries, previous experience with the search engine, whether
ranking of the results matching user’s expectation, etc.
When analysing user behaviour, it is desirable to use
linguistic labels to describe above various factors in order to
conduct a more meaningful study to answer questions such
as “whether loyal users are more likely to issue short length
queries or medium length queries, if so, is that behaviour
linked with high click through rate or is it linked with
the user’s previous search experience?” in a more human
understandable way. Fuzzy set theory, particularly Zadeh’s
paradigm of computing with words [10], was especially
developed for the task of representing human linguistic
concepts in terms of a mathematical object, a fuzzy subset.
However, it is interesting to note that we found few fuzzy
research focusing on user behaviour understanding. Most of
the research efforts aim at web log usage mining [11], [12];
various fuzzy methods, such as fuzzy clustering algorithms
[13], [14], [15], [16], fuzzy approximate reasoning [17],
fuzzy association rules mining [18], were applied to accom-
plish different Web log mining tasks. The closest work to
our method is [19], which proposed to use fuzzy association
rules to mine sequential user navigation patterns in Web log.
However, the method is complex, and can not be applied to
collective user behaviour study. In this paper, we propose six
variables relating to user search behaviour and demonstrate
how mass assignment theory based fuzzy association rules
mining can intelligently analyse user activity in a large scale
Web search log data set.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section II,
we discuss the need of subjective analysis to understand user
behaviour and theoretical foundation of fuzzy association
rules mining. In Section III, we demonstrate how to intel-
ligently extract knowledge from a large scale web search log
using the proposed granular association algorithm. Finally
in Section IV, we conclude the paper and propose several
interesting research directions in the future.
II. GRANULE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS
Association rule mining [20] was first proposed to mine
rules from transaction databases. The aim of association rule
mining is to determine whether or not there are links between
two disjoint subsets of items for example, do customers
generally buy biscuits and cheese when beer, lager and wine
are bought.
Formally, let I = {i1, i2, ..., in} be a set of items and
T = {t1, t2, ..., tm} be a set of transactions. Notice that any
transaction can be represented as ti ? I. Let x and y be
978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE
two non-overlapping subsets of I, X and Y be two sets of
transactions containing items x and y respectively. The goal
of association analysis is to search for interesting association
or correlation relationships between X and Y . That is, if the
items in x appear in a transaction, it is likely that the items
in y will also appear i.e. it is not an implication in the formal
logical sense.
There are two useful measures for the association analysis;
support and confidence. The support of a rule is the fraction
of transactions in which both X and Y appear, and the
confidence of a rule is an estimate (based on the samples) of
the conditional probability of Y given X . The mathematical
definitions are given below.
Supp(X ,Y) =
|X ? Y|
|T |
(1)
Conf(X ,Y) =
|X ? Y|
|X |
(2)
Typically association rule mining algorithms discover all
item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-
specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confi-
dence (minconf) constraints. Minsup controls the minimum
number of data cases that a rule must cover.Minconf controls
the predictive strength of the rule. A association rule is
correct if it satisfies these two parameters.
Fuzzy association analysis has been intensively studied in
recent years [21], [22], [23], [18]. The standard extension
to the fuzzy case is to treat the (multi-) sets X , Y as fuzzy
and find the intersection and cardinality using a t-norm and
sigma-count respectively. The confidence Equation (2) is
transformed into
Conf(X ,Y) =
?
i?I
?X?Y(i)
?
i?I
?X (i)
(3)
where ? refers to the monadic fuzzy membership function.
Using min and the sigma count for cardinality can be
unsatisfactory [22] because it does not distinguish between
several tuples with low memberships and few tuples with
high memberships.
In the granule setting we allow partial membership. For
example, instead of looking for an association between
potato crisps and beer, we might look for an association
between snack foods and alcoholic drinks. It is important to
note that we are dealing with conjunctive fuzzy sets (monadic
fuzzy relations) here. Mass assignment theory is normally
applied to fuzzy sets representing possibility distributions
and the operation of finding the conditional probability of
one fuzzy set given another is known as semantic unification
[24]. This rests on the underlying assumption of a single
valued attribute. A different approach is required to find the
conditional probability when we are dealing with set-valued
attributes. In the rest of the section we briefly discuss mass
assignment based fuzzy association rule mining algorithm.
Detailed theoretical study can be found at [25].
A. Granule Association Analysis: Mass-based Approach
When working with large datasets, a natural approach is
to group similar items/transactions into categories (or sets)
and summarise the data in term of such categories, which is
a key feature of human intelligence to discover knowledge.
Granules provide a convenient way to describe a finite set
of objects by specifying certain selection criteria. Once the
granules are constructed, one may be interested in developing
computational methods to study the relationships among
these granules.
The core of information granulation [26] is that informa-
tion can be processed on different levels of abstraction in
which data objects are organised into meaningful granules1
so as to convey a perception of information itself. Thus, it
is necessary to study the criteria for deciding how “a clump
of points (objects) are drawn together by indistinguishability,
similarity, proximity or functionality [26]”. In this paper, we
assume that the entities (instances) that are being categorised
are known unambiguously.
We consider two granules, represented as monadic fuzzy
relations X and Y on the same domain, and wish to cal-
culate the degree of association between them. For exam-
ple, consider a search transaction database of Web search
engine, containing activity time and number of queries fig-
ures. We can categorise transactions according to whether
their activity time are long, medium or short and also
according to whether their click through rate figures are
high, moderate or low. A mining task might be finding out
whether the high click through rate figures are associated
with long activity time. Given Table I
TABLE I
ACTIVITY TIME V.S. CLICK THROUGH RATE
ID Activity Time(s) Click Through Rate
a 4,000 10%
b 3,200 4%
c 2,000 8%
d 800 7%
suppose we have source granule as long activity time (X )
and target granule as high click through rate (Y), by
defining the monadic fuzzy relations
X = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2]
and
Y = [a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7]
It is important to note that these represent sets of values
that all satisfy the related granule to a degree. Unless
explicitly mentioned, all the sets in the rest of the section
shall be interpreted as conjunctive relations. The confidence
in an association rule in such setting can be calculated as
follows.
1A fuzzy subset of the universe corresponds to a granule in this paper.
Without loss of generality, we explain the operations on
the source granule. For a source granule, we have
X = [x1/?X(x1), x2/?X(x2), ..., x|X |/?X(x|X |)]
we can define the corresponding mass assignment [24]
for the source granule as follows. Let the set of distinct
memberships in X be
{?
(1)
X , ?
(2)
X , ..., ?
(nX )
X }
where
?
(1)
X > ?
(2)
X > ... > ?
(nX)
X
and nX ? |X |.
Let
X1 = {[x|?X(x) = ?
(1)
X ]}
and
Xi = {[x|?X(x) ? ?
(i)
X ]}, 1 < i ? nX
then the mass assignment corresponding to X is
{Xi : mX(Xi)}, 1 ? i ? nX
where
mX(Xk) = ?
(k)
X ? ?
(k+1)
X (?
(i)
X = 0 if i > nX)
For example, given source granule
X = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2]
it has the corresponding mass assignment
MX = {[a] : 0.2, [a, b] : 0.3, [a, b, c] : 0.3, [a, b, c, d] : 0.2}
We can now calculate the confidence in the association
between the granules X and Y using mass assignment theory.
In general, this will be an interval as we are free to move
mass (consistently) between elements of each Xi and Yj .
For two mass assignments,
MX = {Xi : mX(Xi)}, 1 ? i ? nX
and
MY = {Yj : mY (Yi)}, 1 ? j ? nY
the composite mass assignment is
MC = MX
?
MY = {S : mC(S)}
where mC is the composite mass allocation function
subject to
nY?
j=1
MC(ij) = mX(Xi)
nX?
i=1
MC(ij) = mY (Yi)
We can get
Conf(X ,Y) =
nX?
i=1
nY?
j=1
MC(ij)× |Xi ? Yj |
nX?
i=1
nY?
j=1
MC(ij)× |Xi|
(4)
We can calculate the confidence in the Table II. This
enables us to calculate association confidences with O(cn)
complexity, rather than O(n4) where c is a constant and n
is the number of focal elements in the source granule X .
For the given example, we get the confidence value 0.744
through Table II. Minimum and maximum confidence are
not considered in this paper. Further details can be found at
[25]. The theoretical comparison study between the proposed
association algorithm and other methods can be found at [27].

III. EXPERIMENTS
We divide our experiments into two parts. The first part is
conducted on part of a Web search click data set with 65,516
unique users and 3,558,412 lines of web search log from
a commercial search engine. This part of the experiments
shows the potentials of the proposed fuzzy association rules
mining algorithm in intelligent user behaviour profiling. The
second part is conducted on the Web search click data set
with 197,476 unique users and 10,853,833 lines of web
search log from the same commercial search engine. This
part of the experiments studies whether enlarged number of
unique users affects the results of user behaviour we dis-
covered. It also demonstrates the scalability of the proposed
method to process large scale data sets.
A. Variables Relating to User Behaviour
The data set contains three months Web search click
data collected from a commercial web search engine in
2006. To safeguard user privacy, all user identifiable data
were anonymised and are further encrypted when analysing
data. The data set has five fields: Anonymous ID, Query
String, Query Time, Item Rank and Clicked URL. They are
summarised in the Table III. In this section, we propose and
TABLE III
WEB SEARCH CLICK DATA SET
Filed name Description
Anonymous ID User identifiable data is anonymised with non-reconstructable crypto function.
Query String User queries consist of words separated by a space and have punctuation removed.
Query time The time stamp when user submitting the query, in format of dd-mm-yyyy ss:mm:hh
Item Rank The rank of the item on which a user clicked, empty if user didn’t click
Clicked URL The URL clicked by a user in the returned search results.

Fig. 2. Fuzzy membership function associated query length categories
discuss several variables relating to user search behaviour
study from a service provider’s perspective. These variables
are explained below.
1) Overall Access Times (OAT). It refers to the number
of times that a user visits a search engine during the
observation time. This variable intuitively indicates a
user’s likability of reusing the search engine.
2) Average Query Length (AQL). It refers to the average
number of words in the user queries during the ob-
servation time. This variable indicates a user’s regular
searching tendency when submitting queries. Note that
we don’t study the actual semantic meaning of query
terms in the user queries as such topic will be discussed
in a different paper.
3) Average Page Rank (APR). It refers to the average
page rank of the URLs that users clicked in the returned
search results. This variable indicates that how positive
a user thinks the ranking of the returned search results
that match his/her expectation.
4) Cumulative Activity Time (CAT). It refers to the
length of the period that a user uses a search engine.
This variable indicates a user’s persistence of using a
search engine. Note that we use the fixed 20 minutes
as the maximum difference between two activities in
the same session as suggested by [28].
5) Click Through Rate (CTR). It refers to the ratio of
user click times to overall visit times during the obser-
vation time. This variable indicates a user’ satisfaction
to the quality of the returned results.
6) Negative Impactor Factor (NIF). It refers to the
ratio of the number of a user’s failed (not-clicked)
unique queries to the number of clicked unique queries.
This variable indicates the psychological impactor to a
user’s searching behaviour. Intuitively, the more times
a user failed to find answers after submitting queries,
the more negative impression a user would get from
a search engine, consequently, the less likely a user
might reuse the search engine.
B. Experiment: Part I
This part of experiment is conducted on a Web search
click data set with 65,516 unique users and 3,558,412 lines
of search transactions. We focus on studying user behaviour
with regard to the variables proposed above. Note that fuzzy
membership functions defined in this section are based on
the priori knowledge and experience, and can be modified
accordingly.
1) User Behaviour Knowledge I - Users v.s. Length of
Query: We aim to study the behavioural relationship between
users and query length in the first study. We define seven
user categories with regard to overall access times (OAT) as
one off (of), infrequent (inf), occasional (occ), intermittent
(int), frequent (freq), very frequent (vf) and loyal (loy).
Fuzzy membership function associated with user categories
is shown in Fig. 1. Similarly, we define three query length
categories as short(s), medium(m) and long(l) (with regard to
the number of words in a query). Fuzzy membership function
associated query length categories is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 4. Fuzzy membership function associated activity time categories
The results are shown in Fig. 3. Note that we don’t produce
the normal format of association rules for sake of better
illustration. For example, the value in Fig. 3(a) is 62.3%.
It represents that the confidence value of rule: loyal user ?
short length queries is 0.623 or 62.3% (IF a user falls into
loyal user category, THEN it is 62.3% confident that the
user will submit short length queries). We can observe that
• Overwhelmingly the users in all categories submit short
length queries to the search engine. This behaviour is
supported by Fig. 3(a) as all the confidence values are
greater than 0.6. Long length queries are rarely used
and are not discussed in the rest of the paper. It would
be interesting to study the reasons behind this user
behaviour, e.g. short queries leading to better search
results which may be further exemplified by higher click
through rate? We leave this question to be answered in
the next section.
• The more the users use the search engine, the more
likely they are to use varied length of queries to search.
This behaviour is exemplified by the Fig. 3(a) as the as-
sociation values between users and short length queries
decrease while those with medium length queries in-
crease. We note that very frequent and loyal users are
especially like to use varied length of queries while
frequent users are more likely to submit short length
queries. It would be interesting to see how such query
behaviour of very frequent/loyal users is formed since
such behaviour is not related to their activity time (see
Fuzzy membership functions in Fig. 4 and associated
results in Fig. 3(b)).
2) User Behaviour Knowledge II - Users with Varied
Query Length v.s. Average Page Ranking, Negative Impact
Factor: We study how search behaviour of frequent/very
frequent/loyal users is associated with the ranking of re-
turned search results. We don’t study their behaviour with
regard to long queries as we conclude in Section III-B.1 that
such queries have no significant association with the users.
We define the page ranking categories as Top, High, Medium,
Low, and Very Low. Fuzzy membership function is shown in
Fig. 5. The results are shown in Fig. 6. We can observe that
• Overwhelmingly the users in all categories click top and
high ranking results as shown in Fig. 6.
• When submitting short length queries, frequent and
very frequent users are more likely to click top rank-
ing results while loyal users are more interested in
high ranking results. When submitting medium length

queries, it is interesting to note that loyal users are most
likely to click high ranking results than top ranking
results as we can see in Fig. 6 that there is significant
difference between the association values. This result
is especially interesting to service providers as our
results show that loyal users have different opinions
with regard to their ranking algorithm. It would be
helpful for service providers personalise/optimise their
ranking algorithm or page layouts for specific users that
are identified as loyal and submitting medium length
queries.
The above results motivate us to ask another question:
would users be impacted negatively if the returned results
don’t match their expectation? Intuitively, the more occasions
a user failed to find an answer through a query, the more
negative impression a user would get from a search engine.
Thus, by investigating such behaviour, it is helpful for
the search engine to have a better understanding of users’
satisfaction with the quality of the returned results in order to
further improve their search experience. We define negative
impact factor categories as Low, Medium and High. Fuzzy
membership function is shown in Fig. 7. The results are
shown in Fig. 8. We can observe that: the more frequently the
users use the search engine, the less likely they are affected
by negative impact factor; the higher ranking results the users
usually click, the more likely they are affected by negative
impact factor. It is thus important for service providers to
ensure that top and high ranking results maximumly match
users’ expectation.

3) User Behaviour Knowledge III - Users with Varied
Query Length v.s. Click Through Rate: We move on to study
how search behaviour of frequent/very frequent/loyal
users is associated with the click through rate, which is a
good way of measuring the success of search engines. We de-
fine click through rate categories as Low, Medium, and High.
Fuzzy membership function is shown in Fig. 9. The results
are shown in Fig. 10. We can observe that: Fig. 10 shows that
loyal users when submittingmedium length queries are very
likely to achieve high click through rate (with confidence
value 0.74) by clicking high ranking results. They are also
less likely to be affected whenmedium length queries failed
to return satisfactory answers. The benefit of this result is
that it would enable service providers to accordingly adjust
their advertisement strategy to allow medium length keyword

Fig. 10. User behaviour study (III)
strings for advertisers in order to maximise potential click
through rate of online advertisements displayed in the search
results pages.
C. Experiment: Part II
This part of experiment is conducted on a Web search click
data set with 197,476 unique users and 10,853,833 lines of
search transactions. This data set contains all the data we
used in the Section III-B. We study whether enlarged number
of unique users affects the results of user behaviour profiling
stated in previous section. It also demonstrates the scalability
of the proposed method to process large scale data sets.
We re-use all the fuzzy membership functions defined in
the previous section. The results are shown in Table IV. It
is safe to conclude that enlarged number of unique users
does not affect the results of user behaviour in Section III-B,
which is strong evidence that the proposed method can be
used to predict people’s behaviour due to the stability of the
results.
To study the scalability, we compare the actual time of
computing V and the results are shown in Table VI. The
experiments are carried out on a Macbook 2.0GHZ with 4GB
memory running Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Java 1.6.0 13. As
the number of users in the second part of the experiment is
increased by 3 times, it is noticeable that the actual comput-
ing time increases by around 10 times while theoretically it
should be around 3c times where c is a constant factor as
mentioned in Section II-A. This would give c a value of 3.5.
It is reasonable to conclude that the complexity of our fuzzy
association algorithm is O(3.5n) in practice.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we propose to use mass assignment based
fuzzy association rule mining algorithm to personalise anal-
ysis of user behaviour from web search log for search
engine providers. We demonstrate that the proposed method
can automatically discover user behaviour knowledge and
is scalable to process large scale dataset. In our future
work, we will conduct more studies on several directions
affecting user search behaviour in the search engine such
as visual layout of returned results, semantic intention of
user queries, psychological impact of failed queries. It would
be desirable to assess the proposed method in different
web search logs, and comparatively study the possible user
behaviour variability in different search engines.
