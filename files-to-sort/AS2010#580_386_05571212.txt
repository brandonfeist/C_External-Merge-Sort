I.  INTRODUCTION  
Knowledge Discovery (KD) is one of the fast growing 
computer science fields. Studies have shown that, KD 
research has gone from machine learning to machine 
discovery and then to KD stages. KD was brought into 
attention in 1989 during the IJCAI Workshop on Knowledge 
Discovery in Databases (KDD) [1]. The workshops were 
then continued annually until 1994. In 1995, the International 
Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 
became the most important annual event for KD. The 
framework of KD was outlined in two books: “Knowledge 
Discovery in Databases” [2] and “Advances in Knowledge 
Discovery and Data Mining” [3]. 
Knowledge Discovery (KD) is a nontrivial process of 
identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately 
understandable patterns from large collections of data [4]. 
One of the KD steps is Data Mining (DM). DM is the step 
that is concerned with the actual extraction of knowledge 
from data, in contrast to the KD process that is concerned 
with many other things like understanding and preparation of 
the data, verification and application of the discovered 
knowledge. In practice, however, people use terms DM, KD, 
and DMKD as synonymous. 
With the advent of information age and the knowledge 
economy, KD theory and technology have become key areas 
of computer applications, the scope of the study of KD is 
expanding, study heat is on the rise. 
Some researchers of domestic and foreign have studied 
the research status, fronts and hot spots, development trends 
in the field of knowledge discovery(KD) in recent years. 
Yang Bing-ru etal (2005) considered that the current 
international KDD research mainly on the knowledge 
discovery task description, knowledge evaluation and 
knowledge representation as the main line in order to effect 
knowledge discovery algorithm as the center, which is a 
fairly long period of time to keep the mainstream tone[5]. 
Krzysztof J. Cios,Lukasz A. Kurgan ?2006?considered 
that  in addition to the design and implementation of a new 
DMKD framework, amore traditional course of action may 
have to be carried out . It includes design and 
implementation of a new generation of high performance 
DM systems that incorporate multiple DM methods , and are 
capable of mining heterogeneous sources of knowledge like 
multimedia data , can visualize the results, and handle huge 
amounts of complex data[6]. SUN Ji-hong and Jiao Yu-ying 
(2006) considers the key areas of knowledge discovery and 
trends in the following areas: text mining, data mining 
(query) language design, data cube data mining, concept 
knowledge base mining, knowledge discovery based on 
visualization, The new methods of mining complex data 
types, scalable methods of data mining. In addition, 
knowledge discovery and data privacy protection and 
information security, development of knowledge discovery 
language, a special query language and optimization of 
mining areas such as data mining are the future development 
trends[7]. Huang Zi-fei (2006) finds that, at present, the 
development trend of foreign KDD research are: research 
and enhanced Bayes and Boosting methods; the traditional 
statistical regression method in the KDD application; KDD 
is closely integrated with the database. In the application 
include KDD commercial software tools are created and 
improved focus on the establishment of problem-solving as a 
whole system rather than an isolated process[8]. Jin 
Zhan(2008) believes that knowledge discovery research 
focus has gradually shifted from the discovery methods to 
system applications, and focus on the integration of a variety 
of strategies and techniques, as well as the mutual 
penetration of various disciplines[9]. Yang Bing-ru (2008) 
thinks that the current trend of KD & DM research are: the 
original theory method of deepening and expansion; complex 
types (system) data mining has become a hot; the 
introduction of new technological methods (other disciplines 
penetration); theoretical study of fusion cross; the 
strengthening of basic theoretical research[10]. Li Jin-hua 
(2009) considers that under the grid environment a 
distributed KD will move towards a wider range and in 
large-scale data sets, and a wealth of knowledge discovery 
tools, a more intelligent knowledge discovery scheduling 
strategy, a higher degree of automation of knowledge found 
in stream process, more personalized knowledge services 
sectors as well[11]. 
However, the study mentioned above is basically a 
qualitative analysis, the result of subjective thought, but I 
intend to study the hot research topics and the research fronts 
in the field of International Knowledge discovery (KD) on 
the base of relevant literature, we will use Scientometrics 
method, from the perspective of knowledge mapping, mainly

in quantitative analysis, and take qualitative analysis as a 
supplement, and hope that it will be benefit to the study of 
Knowledge discovery(KD). 
II. DATA SOURCES AND RESEARCH METHODS 
The data used in the articles come from the documents in 
Data Base Web of Science(SCI-EXPANDED?  SSCI? 
A&HCI), which is published by Institute for Scientific 
Information(ISI)in the United States.) ISI is the only 
international most authoritative source citation information, 
which is convenient for us to download data, transform data 
formats and analyze data. Data retrieval strategy is"TS 
(subject) = Knowledge discovery AND language=(English) 
AND document type=(Article) data base= SCI-EXPANDED
? SSCI? A&HCI AND time=1986-2009)", a total of 3987 
articles are retrieved, and the date of the downloaded is 
March 10, 2010. 
In this paper, knowledge mapping method which is 
method mainly in quantitative analysis is used[12][13]. With 
the information visualization software Citespace developed 
by Dr. Chen Chaomei [14], the article conically shows the 
image of the hot research topics and the research fronts in the 
field of international PIRM. Mapping knowledge can 
directly show us the compelling forefront of the field or the 
commanding heights of the subject in the knowledge or 
information through visual images, it can help people 
mining, analysis and display of scientific knowledge as well 
as the mutual relations between them, and we are able to 
more intuitively identify the evolution path of the forefront 
and the classic foundation documents in the subject) areas. 
Analyze the co-cited authors, we can find the important core 
person and the academic relation between them[15] [16]. In 
addition, CiteSpace also has the capability of key words 
clustering and the burst words detection, so we can 
determine the research fronts and development trends of 
some research fields. 
III. ANALYSIS 
A. The key nodes in literature network in International KD 
in 1986-2009  
 
We input all the 3987 "KD" documents published in 
1986-2009 into Citespace, network nodes selected reference, 
the source of key words select title,  abstract, descriptors and 
identifiers, lexical item select noun phrases, adjusting 
threshold of the Citespace to (2, 2,20), (4, 3, 20), (4, 3, 20), 
and Select pathfinder algorithm, running Citespace. we got 
the documents published in 1986-2009co-cited Knowledge 
map in KD, shown in Figure 1, the bigger the font the more 
important the node that literature. 
 
 
By Figure 1 we can clearly see the relationship between 
the co-citation of classical literatures in the field of 
international knowledge discovery?KD?study. In this map 
we can see that five of the most prominent of the key nodes 
in literature, in Table 1. According to Dr. Chen Chaomei 
definition, a total cited in the key nodes in the network map 
is a map to connect two or more different clusters, and the 
relative centrality and a higher cited node. These nodes may 
be the key points in the network from one time period to 
another period of time [17] .from the knowledge point of 
view, the key nodes are generally the classical literatures 
which point to an important new theory, or have a major 
theoretical innovation, are also the literatures which most 
likely to form a hot spot of cutting-edge scientific.

As can be seen from Figure 1, according to the node in 
the network were cited in the size of the view of the most 
prominent is “Mining association rules between sets of items 
in large databases” written by R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and 
A.N. Swami in 1993.In the paper, Agrawal,etc. first 
proposed the association rules problem between item sets 
29
  
when mining customer transaction database, and its core is 
recursive method based on the frequency of set theory, 
association rules is an important topic in the field of Data 
mining, which described the law of knowledge model in a 
transaction between items of simultaneous. [18] 
Tied for second place the author is Quinlan, J.R?In 
1993, he published a book?”C4.5: Programs for Machine 
Learning", in which he proposed C4. 5 Algorithm improved 
version of ID3. The core idea of Decision Tree Algorithm is 
to use information entropy principle, select the properties of 
the maximum rate of information gain as a classification 
attribute, recursively construct the decision tree branches to 
complete the construction of decision tree. [19][20] 
Came in third place is the"Fast algorithms for mining 
association rules in large databases" published in1994 
written by Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. in this article, R 
Agrawal proposed the well-known Apriori algorithm, which 
use the monotony of support to pruning the candidate sets, 
thereby greatly reducing the number of candidate sets and 
the computing time, many of the association rules algorithms 
followed by are based on Apriori algorithm or its 
variants.[21][22] 
In addition?Breiman,L., Friedman,J.H., Olshen,R.A., 
and Stone,C.J proposed the CART(Classification and 
Regression Tree) in their book “ Classification and 
Regression Trees” published in 1984.[23] Quinlan, J.R 
proposed the proposed the ID3Decision Tree Algorithm in 
his article “Induction of decision trees”published in 1986. 
[24] These documents are also the key and important 
literatures in the study of international knowledge discovery 
(KD) and in the center of knowledge map of knowledge 
discovery , and they played an important role to promote 
study of international knowledge discovery(KD). 
 
B. Analysis of the international KD research topics 
 
Use keywords in bibliographies, and with software 
Citespace, we can determine the hot topics of international 
PIRM research. Although the keywords in an article are 
small in proportion, but they are the core and essence of the 
article, a highly condensed summary and concise of article 
theme, so the keywords of an article, especially the high 
frequency words are often used to determine the hot topics of 
some field[25] [26]. Citespace, writen in Java language, is a 
visualization software based on Co-citation Analysis. 
Running this software, you can analysis and process the path 
of the Co-citation network of the scientific document citation 
by using the pathfinder algorithm [27] or minimum spanning 
trees algorithm [28] [29] , and you can also determine the 
main areas and hot topics of international KD study by high 
frequency words display. 
We input all the 3987 "KD" documents published in 
1986-2009 into Citespace, network nodes selected keyword, 
the source of key words select title,  abstract, descriptors and 
identifiers, lexical item select noun phrases, adjusting 
threshold of the Citespace to (2, 2,20), (4, 3, 20), (4, 3, 20), 
and Select pathfinder algorithm, running Citespace. After 
sorted out, we got a list of key words that the total cites are 
more than 50 times(see table 2), as well as a knowledge map 
of the hot topics in international KD research in Figure 2. 
 
Table 2 the keywords frequency > 50 in "KD" documents

Figure 2 shows the co-occurrence network of the high-
frequency key words. From Figure 2 and Table 2, we can 
clearly see that the highest frequency term is knowledge 
discovery, the frequency is 541 times, followed by data 
mining, the frequency is 305 times, it shows that data mining 
and knowledge discovery inseparable, data mining is also the 
core and basis points of international KD study. The high-
frequency keywords also show other hot topics of KD, 
including drug discovery ? prior knowledge ? neural 
network?association rule and so on. The particularly worth 
mentioning is that KD(data mining) applications in the 
medical field. KD(Data mining) technology provides a new 
thinking and methods for drug discovery.KD(data 
mining)technology can help researchers to discover the 
hidden knowledge in large database,, have a better, faster, 
more efficient decision-making, improve competitiveness, 
speed up the pace of drug discovery, improve the level of 
drug discovery.[30][31][32]? In addition, neural network, 
association rule is also the hot spots in the field of KD. 
 
C. Research front and development trend of international 
KD 
For the same 3987 "KD" articles published in 1986-
2009?with the burst detection technology and algorithm of 
Citespace, by the temporal distribution, detect out the burst 
terms,) rely on change trends of the terms frequency, not just 
the high or low of the frequency, to determine the research 
front and development trends in the field of international KD 
research [33]. Select network node: key term, and select 
burst phrases, then select the default threshold values (2, 2, 
20), (4, 3, 20), (4, 3, 20), click find burst phrases, by running 
30
  
Citespace, we can detect the first seven burst terms?false 
discovery rate?pharmaceutical industry?gene expression 
data ? binding site ? clustering algorithm ? genetic 
algorithm?potential discovery, as shown in Figure 3. 
 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
Since the concept of KD is known to the world, there are 
more and more researches on KD&DM. By analyzing the 
3987 papers of knowledge discovery (KD) published in 
1986-2009 in Web of Science (SCI, SSCI, A&HCI) database
?we can draw the following conclusions:   
(1)R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.N. Swami,Quinlan 
J.R,Agrawal,  R.  and  Srikant,  R Breiman,L., 
Friedman,J.H., Olshen,R.A., and Stone,C.J,Quinlan, J.R are 
the important literature authors in the field of knowledge 
discovery (KD).  
(2)knowledge discovery ,data mining,drug discovery?
prior knowledge?neural network?association rule etc. are 
the hot research topics in the field of knowledge discovery 
(KD).   
(3)In recent years, false discovery rate, pharmaceutical 
industry, gene expression data, binding site, clustering 
algorithm, genetic algorithm, potential discovery?etc.  have 
become the research fronts in the field of knowledge 
discovery (KD),and they are also represent the research 
trends of international knowledge discovery (KD)..
