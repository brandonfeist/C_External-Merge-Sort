I. INTRODUCTION 
     The agricultural land evaluation developed from the 
researches on soil inventory for estimating yield, soil nature, 
and soil fertility, to management and evaluation of land 
resource integrated land with environmental factors and 
human factors [1].  To make evaluation result reflect the 
quality of land  and the change of land-use, and afford better 
quality of service for land use and land plan consequently, 
some land evaluation algorithms have been proposed. Hu  
took Zhejiang Province as the study area of red soil, applied 
red soil resources information system to classify the RSR 
types [2]. Shen designed several sampling distributions based 
on the whole training sample distribution to study the spatial 
variety of soil properties using BP neural network ensemble 
[3]. Damjan used machine learning methods including model

trees and inducing regression, and built empirical models to 
predict the soil quality using agricultural measures in terms of 
quantities describing the soil microarthropod community [4]. 
Other methods,  such as Decision Trees [5], ANN [5], 
Support Vector Machines [5], Decision Support System [6], 
and Immune Algorithm[7], are also be used to evaluate land 
resource.  
Although these impersonal methods are effective, the 
knowledge representation of land evaluation is limited. The 
algorithms of extracting rules, which could improve the 
intelligibility and efficiency of the land evaluation 
knowledge, are represented. Generally speaking, association 
rules between sets of items in large databases can be mined by 
data mining technique such as Apriori Algorithm. Algorithms 
are proposed by researchers for mining or extracting rules. 
The methods Hisao Ishibuchi etc. [8, 9, 10] extended 
demonstrated that the generalization ability of linguistic rules 
is less sensitive than the choice of a discretization method and 
the number of rules than that of standard association rules.  
In order to improve the intelligibility and efficiency of the 
land evaluation knowledge and to reduce the complexity of 
the land evaluation models and to improve the efficiency and 
intelligibility of fuzzy classification association rules further, 
an algorithm to eliminate redundant rules for obtaining the 
simplified fuzzy classification association rules is presented. 
In addition, considering the challenge of a few samples that 
are difficult to classify the process of fuzzy decision, an 
iterative algorithm for grouping fuzzy decision for datasets is 
discussed. 
 
II. SIMPLIFIED FUZZY CLASSIFICATION ASSOCIATION 
RULES AND GROUPING FUZZY DECISION 
A. Parameters for mining algorithm 
The most important parameters for mining algorithm 
include Support and Confidence. 
Suppose an attribute  set 1 2{ , , , }mI A A A= …   and a 
transaction database 1 2{ , , , }nD d d d= … ,the expression for 
Support and Confidence of fuzzy association rules  A B?  
could be defined as [11]: 
     Support ratio of fuzzy association rule: 
                                                                                                                                          192

The weights, which are calculated by land evaluation 
experts, can be utilized directly. 
 
B. Generate fuzzy classification association rules 
Once the Support and Confidence are calculated by the 
equation above paragraphs, fuzzy classification association 
rules can be extracted by the algorithm the following 
paragraphs motions.  
Mining fuzzy classification association rules is a 2-step 
process: 
1. Mine fuzzy classification association rules and partial 
association rules from the frequent itemsets. Find all frequent 
itemsets, which occur at least as pre-determined minimum 
Support. 
2. Simplify the fuzzy classification association rules. 
Checking the redundant rules generated from the frequent 
itemsets.  
Indeed, the smaller the minimum Support is, the more the 
frequent itemsets are, and the more complexity of the 
algorithm is. Fuzzy classification association rules can be 
extracted from the frequent itemsets, while the rules satisfied 
minimum Support and minimum Confidence. Partial fuzzy 
association rules can be obtained in the process of the 
algorithm at the same time. Partial fuzzy association rules can 
be utilized to describe the relationship among all the factors 
or a certain factors, as well as the relationship between some 
factors and the classification of land resources. The rules, on 
the one hand, can help the land evaluation experts to analyze 
the relationship among all the factors or a certain factors, as 
well as the relationship between some factors and the 
classification of land resources, on the other hand, some fuzzy 
classification association rules with strong intelligibility can 
be utilized to construct a classifier to evaluate the land 
resources. 
 
C. Fuzzy decision 
One method for land resources is fuzzy decision based on 
fuzzy classification association rules. Customarily, it doesn’t 
need the character of the samples entirely match with the 
standard pattern, but to estimate which standard pattern the 
character that is the most approaching to, then belong to it. 
Thus, a land evaluation method combining fuzzy 
classification association rules with fuzzy decision is 
proposed in this paper. Concretely, based on the theory of 
concept fuzzy matching degree and the method fuzzy 
inference, calculate the fuzzy degree of the test samples 
matching to the fuzzy classification association rules, then 
find the maximum fuzzy matching degree and select which 
rule corresponding to, the classification of the rule is the 
result of the test samples, i.e. the classification of the land 
resources. 
Fuzzy membership function includes Gaussian curve 
membership function, Bell curve membership function, 
Trapezoidal membership function, Triangular membership 
function and Sigmoid curve membership function and so on. 
Gaussian curve membership function is selected as the 
membership function in this paper. The membership of fuzzy 
subsets F   for the element of universe is shown as: 
   2( ) exp[ ( ) ]F
x cx?
?
?
= ?   (3) 
In which ?   is variance, c  is value of center.  
For the reason it’s simple and effective to calculate by 
using maximum membership function criterion 
multiplication-product method, the method is selected to 
calculate the fuzzy degree of the test samples matching to the 
fuzzy classification association rules. In the process of fuzzy 
matching, the mathematics expression of fuzzy matching for 
the j th rule is shown as: 
   2

( ) ( ) exp[ ( ) ]
k k
i
Fji

In which k  is the quantity of factors, Fji?  is the 
membership of the test samples based on the  j th rule and  
i th factor, ?  is variance, c  is value of center, ( )Fd j   is 
multiplication-product of  i th factors based on the j th rule. 
Find the maximum fuzzy matching degree and select which 
rule corresponding to; the classification of the rule is the 
result of the test samples. The mathematics expression of 
maximum membership of l  fuzzy classification association 
rules is: 
1
max ( )

FD Fd j

D. Simplify fuzzy classification association rules 
Redundant items exist in the frequent items potentially; 
redundant rules exist in the fuzzy classification association 
rules at the same time. The redundant rules increase 
complexity of land evaluation models and decrease efficiency 
and intelligibility of fuzzy classification association rules.  
To make a premise that guarantee the accuracy of fuzzy 
decision can not be reduced, the rule simplifying method of is 
to check the self-accuracy of the rules, the process of 
simplifying is: 
                                                                                                                                          193
Step1: Sort fuzzy classification association rules in 
ascending order by the principle of Support, and define 
threshold of the removable rules; 
Step2: Eliminate the first fuzzy classification association 
rule from the repository, and the new repository is formed. 
Make a fuzzy decision of all the test samples by using the 
new repository eliminated the first fuzzy classification 
association rule. If the accuracy of fuzzy decision is not 
decrease or less than the threshold of the removable rules, the 
rule can be eliminated, and the new repository is preserved. If 
the accuracy of fuzzy decision is decrease or more than the 
threshold of the removable rules, the rule must be preserved, 
and the repository is restored by the repository before 
eliminating the first fuzzy classification association rule. 
Step3: Eliminate the second fuzzy classification association 
rule from the initial repository. Notice, in despite of the first 
fuzzy classification association rule is eliminated or not, the 
repository contains the first fuzzy classification association 
rule. Then, estimate the second fuzzy classification 
association rule is eliminated or not in the manner of Step2. 
Step4: Go to Step2 and Step3, in this manner, until the last 
fuzzy classification association rule is estimated. 
 
E.  Grouping Fuzzy Decision 
When using the algorithms fuzzy decision, the situation that 
the same product may obtain by largest degree of membership 
under the simplified fuzzy association rules, so that the largest 
degree of fuzzy matching rules corresponding to more than 
one rule, resulting the classifier can not even match rules to 
the testing samples. Therefore, the grouping fuzzy decision 
algorithm is discussed in this paper, that is, dividing the entire 
database into two data sets, including sole fuzzy decision data 
sets and non-sole fuzzy decision data sets, the samples 
contained in sole fuzzy decision data sets can be evaluated 
only by simplified fuzzy classification association rules; the 
simplified fuzzy association rules are extracted again from the 
rest samples by resetting another minimum Support when the 
samples of non-sole fuzzy decision data sets are evaluated by 
fuzzy decision. If the non-sole data sets in the fuzzy decision 
are still difficult to evaluated, divide the data sets into another 
sole data sets and non-sole data sets, then use the same 
method again iterative, and so on. 
 
III. EXPERIMENT  
Database had been selected from the database of Second 
General Soil Survey Database of Guangdong Province, and 
16652 records of samples were selected, which are related to 
the agriculture resources. The influence factors altitude (EL), 
slope gradient (SL), soil pH (pH), organic matter content 
(OM), soil texture (TE) and land utilization type (LU), can be 
classified the parameters into five fuzzy sets. And 
classification of soil resource that can be mainly classified 
into 4 subsets, Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV. 
Fuzzy classification association rules and partial fuzzy 
association rules can be obtained after mining the database of 
Second General Soil Survey of Guangdong Province. Partial 
fuzzy association rules can be utilized to describe the 
relationship among all the factors or a certain factors, as well 
as the relationship between some factors and the classification 
of land resources.  
Set user-prescribed threshold ?  =0.6. 
 
IV. RESULTS 
Fuzzy classification association rules and partial fuzzy 
association rules can be extracted using fuzzy association 
rules. Fuzzy association rules are effective, not only to 
discover the partial rules among the land evaluation factors or 
the partial rules between the land evaluation factors and the 
land evaluation results, but also to extract convenient 
intelligible land evaluation classification rules from training 
samples.  
Fuzzy classification association rules can be utilized to 
describe the relationship between all the factors and the 
classification of land resources. Set min_support=0.01, 19 
fuzzy classification association rules can be extracted. 
Results of land evaluation method combining fuzzy 
classification association rules with fuzzy decision are shown 
as Table 1. In order to compare the results with different 
minimum supports, the correct rate of quantity and area is 
collected statistics. For instance, while setting the minimum 
support is 0.01, 19 fuzzy classification association rules can 
be extracted, 12836 samples and 1.369766E+5 kmP2 P are 
evaluated correctly, take 77.0838% and 78.8791% percentage 
of total quantity and total area respectively. 
The experimental results of Table 1 indicate that the 
quantity of rules increases with increasing the accuracy of 
fuzzy decision, which is logical to the truth. The experimental 
results also indicate that the algorithm combining fuzzy 
classification association rules and fuzzy decision is resultful 
to reduce the complexity of the land evaluation models, 
improve the efficiency and intelligibility of fuzzy 
classification association rules, reduce dependence on 
experience of land evaluation domain, and a satisfactory 
accuracy can be obtained. 
However, redundant rules that exist in the knowledge base 
composed of fuzzy classification association rules are 
discovered in the process of operation. In order to reduce the 
complexity of the land evaluation models and improve the 
efficiency and intelligibility of fuzzy classification association 
rules further, an algorithm to eliminate redundant rules is 
proposed above. Specially, an experiment for simplifying is 
accomplished in the case of minimum support is equal to 
0.005. 
Five models in different pattern are utilized to test entire 
records of database by using fuzzy classification association 
rules shown as Table 3. In the first row of Table 2, "Original 
Model" denotes the fuzzy decision result of fuzzy decision 
using 32 fuzzy classification association rules as knowledge 
base extracted in the case of setting minimum support is equal 
to 0.005. Fuzzy classification association rules are sorted in 
order of first appearance of the record in the database. "Sorted 
Model" denotes the fuzzy decision result of fuzzy 
                                                                                                                                          194
classification association rules are sorted in order of 
Confidence on the base of "Original Model". "Simplified 
Model" denotes the fuzzy decision result of using 23 
simplified fuzzy classification association rules after 
simplifying the knowledge base of "Sorted Model". In order 
to compare with three models, fuzzy decision result of 32 
simplified fuzzy classification association rules is calculated. 
79 simplified fuzzy classification association rules are 
obtained after simplifying 126 fuzzy classification association 
rules extracted in the case of setting minimum support is 
equal to 0.001. "Adjusting Model" selects head 32 simplified 
fuzzy classification association rules sorted by confidence of 
79 simplified fuzzy classification association rules as 
knowledge base.  “Grouping Model” improves the efficiency 
of the non-sole fuzzy decision data sets when the samples are 
difficult to evaluate. 
The experimental results of Table 2 indicate that in the case 
of selecting 32 fuzzy classification association rules as 
knowledge base, "Grouping Model" gets the best accuracy in 
five models. "Sorted Model" and "Adjusting Model" provide 
higher precision with the area accuracy improved by 1.5202% 
and 3.8989% to "Original Model", and the knowledge of 
"Simplified Model" eliminates 9 redundant rules, provide 
higher precision with the area accuracy improved by 1.8562% 
to "Original Model" only using 23 simplified fuzzy 
classification association rules. Notice, the area accuracy of 
"Sorted Model" and "Simplified Model" is almost the same, 
because "Simplified Model" only removes the redundant 
rules, but the model is less complexity. It's significative for 
improve the efficiency and intelligibility of the rules.  
 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents the land evaluation method based on 
simplified fuzzy classification association rules and fuzzy 
decision. The method not only can be used to mine fuzzy 
classification association rules, but also can used to mine 
partial fuzzy association rules. Partial fuzzy association rules

classification association rules with strong intelligibility can 
be utilized to construct a classifier to evaluate the land 
resources and four models combining fuzzy decision are 
compared. Simplified fuzzy classification association rules 
provide a high accuracy, “Adjusting Model” performs better 
in stability, system robustness, and reducing the complexity 
of the land evaluation models, and “Grouping Model" gets the 
best accuracy in five models, as well as in stability and
