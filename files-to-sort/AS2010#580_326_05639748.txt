Abstract In data mining we not only mine the potential 
association between items, but also estimate the existent 
association of items which is still reasonable whether or not. 
Association Rules is mainly used to find the useful knowledge of 
the items in the mass data. However with the time goes by or the 
environment changes, previous association rules between data 
items or initial rules might be not reasonable, so we should check 
these rules to find the unreasonable ones. An association rule can 
not find the unreasonable relation between the data items. In this 
paper, we regard the structure of rules found by association rules 
as a digraph, and propose the Pseudo-association Rules based on 
an association rule, which can find the unreasonable rules.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Data mining also known as knowledge discovery in 
database is used to discover implicit, previously unknown, and 
potentially useful information from data and it is an area 
including database, artificial intelligence, and machine learning 
[5]. 
Association rule [1] is proposed in 1993 at first by Agrawal, 
and it has received much more attention by now. An 
association rule is still used popularly for pattern discovery in 
KDD. It is used for mining the significant association rules 
between items in the trade database, which have reflected the 
behavior mode of the customers. An association rule can also 
be applied to design the catalog, add to sales, website's 
structure optimization, storage planning, network accident 
analysis etc. Now let’s consider the following problems: the 
first problem is, assume customers buy beers and also diapers. 
However when the time goes by or the season changes, does 
this rule remain reasonable?  The second is when we design a 
web site, designers do it with their experience, and how can we 
estimate whether the web site is optimization. For these 
reasons, we present the concept of the Pseudo-association 
Rules (PAR) to solve the problem. The Pseudo-association 
Rules can find out whether the relations among the data are still 
reasonable which had been found by an association rule in the 
past. If this rule judged by Pseudo-association Rules is 
unreasonable, then get rid of this rule; otherwise, keep it. 
A. Association Rules  
An association rule is the following statement [1]:  Let I=I1,  
I2, …, Im be a set of items. Given a database D of transactions, 
where each transaction t is represented as a set of items, with 
t[k] = 1 if t bought the item Ik, and t[k] = 0 otherwise. Let X be 
a set of some items in I. We say that a transaction t satisfies X if 
for all items Ik in X, t[k] = 1. 
In brief, we view an association rule as an implication of 
the form X ?  Ij, where X is a set of some items in I, and Ij is a 
single item in I that is not present in X. The rule X? Ij is 
satisfied in the set of transactions T with the confidence factor 
0 ? c ? 1 if at least c% of transactions in T that satisfy X also 
satisfy Ij. We will use the notation X? Ij | c to specify that the 
rule X ?  Ij has a confidence factor of c. 
Given a set of transactions D, the problem of mining 
association rules is to generate all association rules that have 
support and confidence greater than the user-specified 
minimum support (called minsup) and minimum confidence 
( called minconf ) respectively. Our discussion is neutral with 
respect to the representation of D. For example, D could be a 
data file, a relational table, or the result of a relational 
expression. 
We define the support(X) as follows: 
||
)(
D
XSupport x?=  (1) 
Here, x?  is represent the number of the set of items in 
which X is included, |D| is amount of D. 
And we define the Confidence as follows: 
)(sup
)(sup)(
Xport
YXportYXConfidenc ?=?  (2) 
Here, X ? Y is the union of itemset X and Y. 
                                                                                                                                          3071
B. Outline of the paper 
In this paper, we view all the rules and items as a digraph 
and describe the principle of the Pseudo-association rules. We 
do the experiment with them to analyze the structure of the web 
site of Jiangxi University of Science and Technology. The 
Pseudo-association rules can find the unreasonable hyperlink of 
web site and then to optimize the structure of web site. 
The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows: In 
Section 2 we present the basic principle of pseudo-association 
rules. In Section 3, we introduce the Pseudo-association Rules 
algorithm. In Section 4, we do the experiment with Pseudo-
association rules to show the effectiveness of it. In Section 5, 
we conclude with a summary and the future work. 
II. BASIC PRINCIPLE OF PSEUDO-ASSOCIATION RULES 
We propose the digraph to represent the rules between 
items in which edge is a rule and vertex is items. The Pseudo-
association Rules scan the database to examine whether the 
edge (rule) is reasonable, and make structure of graph more 
rational. A lot of disciplines have something to do with 
digraph, so it is essential to optimize the digraph. The 
prerequisite in the Pseudo-association Rules is that the relations 
among the itemset are definite. In the data mining, we can 
utilize the Pseudo-association Rules to find the irrationality of 
the relation between the items, thus we reach the optimization 
of the data.  
We call it the Pseudo-association Rules, just because in the 
target objects (database, website, etc.), we have given a certain 
relation between the elements, but the existence of this kind of 
relation is unreasonable. The Pseudo-association rules 
algorithm will recognize this kind of unreasonable or untrue 
relation. Since this relation is unreasonable, then we call it 
Pseudo-association rules. Because of property of the Pseudo-
association rules, we can use it to optimize the graph.  
A. The Digraph Structure of Database 
We consider that association rules are regarded to find out 
potential edges of the digraph, while the pseudo-association 
rules is to find out the unreasonable edges of the graph. That is 
to say, we can use the directed graph to represent the items as 
vertexes and view the edges as the relation between the items.  
Now we give the definition of the graph as follows [3]:  
A graph (or undirected graph) G consists of a set V of 
vertices (or nodes) and a set E of edges (or arcs) such that each 
edge e ?E is associated with an unordered pair of vertices. If 
there is a unique edge e associated with the vertices v and w, 
we write e = (v, w) or e = (w, v). In this context, (v, w) denotes 
an edge between v and w in an undirected graph and not an 
ordered pair. 
A directed graph (or digraph) G consists of a set V of 
vertices (or nodes) and a set E of edges (or arcs) such that each 
edge e ?  E is associated with an ordered pair of vertices. If 
there is a unique edge e associated with the ordered pair (v, w) 
of vertices, we write e = (v, w), which denotes an edge from v 
to w. 
An edge e in a graph (undirected or directed) that is 
associated with the pair of vertices v and w is said to be 
incident on v and w, and v and w are said to be incident on e 
and to be adjacent vertices. 
If G is a graph (undirected or directed) with vertices V and 
edges E, we is assumed to be nonempty.

Fig. 1. The graph model 
Figure 1 is a graph G consisting of the set V = {S, D, F, Z, 
Q, H, R, Y, W, N} of vertices and the set E = {e1, e2,…, e12} of 
edges. Edge e1 is associated with the pair {S, D} of vertices, 
and edge e5 is associated with the pair {F, H} of vertices. Edge 
e1 is denoted (S, D) or (D, S), and edge e5 is denoted (F, H) or 
(H, F). 
B. The Pseudo-association Rules 
Let G = {V, E} be a digraph composed by rules and items. 
Let I = {x1, … ,xn} be a set of distinct literals, called items. A V 
is a set of items and its element Vj ?  I with k = |Vj| is called a 
k-itemset (A k-itemset is an itemset with k items) or simply an 
itemset. E is a set of rules of items. Let a database D be a multi-
set of subsets of I. We say that an association rule is an 
expression X? Y, where X, Y(X, Y? V) are itemsets and 
X ? Y = ?  holds and X? Y ?E.  
In pseudo-association rules, we evaluate each of relation 
X? Y in set of E, which is reasonable whether or not. We use 
the notation X ? >Y to represent the relation of items between 
X and Y as the unreasonable relation in the set of E, if the 
relation X ?Y is not reasonable. We make the relation (edge) 
X? Y as X ? >Y in the set of E, if the support or the 
confidence of X ? Y is lower than the certain threshold support 
and confidence. Here, we define the threshold of support called 
maxsupport, and the threshold of confidence called 
maxconfidence. 
We think that the meaning of the support and confidence in 
the pseudo-association rules is same as that in the association 
rule. Confidence is a measure of the rule’s strength, supports to 
statistical significance [1]. 
Here, the threshold of maxconfidence is lower than min-
confidence. If the value of confidence is between 
maxconfidence and min-confidence, we think that the rule is 
not strong enough but it does not mean the rule could be a 
pseudo-association rule. 
                                                                                                                                          3072
Consider a supermarket, for example, assuming that we 
have found the association between “sausage” and “mustard” 
by association rules, now we re-calculate the support and 
confidence of the association. If they are lower than the 
threshold of minsupport and maxsuspicion respectively, we 
should change the location of “sausage” and “mustard” on sale, 
and analyses what cause the association disappearing. 
As the pseudo-association rules, it may include following 
respects: 
• The support is greater than the maxsupport while confidence 
is lower than the maxconfidence. 
• The support is lower than the maxsupport while 
maxconfidence is greater than the maxsuspicion. 
• Both the support and the confidence are lower than the 
maxsupport and maxconfidence respectively. 
III. PSEUDO-ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM  
In the pseudo-association rules, we have known the 
association among the items at the beginning, and then we 
calculate the support and the confidence of the association of 
items. So we can regard the pseudo-association rules algorithm 
as a reverse procedure against an association rule algorithm 
such as Apriori or AprioriTid [2].  
A. An Apriori algorithm 
In an Apriori algorithm, we can decompose the problem of 
the rule mining into two subproblems [1]: 
• Find all sets of items (itemsets) that have transaction support 
above minimum support. The support for an itemset is the 
number of transactions that contain the itemset. Itemsets 
with minimum support are called large itemsets, and all 
others small itemsets.  
• Use the large itemsets to generate the desired rules. Here is a 
straightforward algorithm for this task. For every such 
subset a, output a rule of the form a? (l – a) if the ratio of 
support(l) to support(a) is at least minconf. We need to 
consider all subsets of l to generate rules with multiple 
consequents. 
Let Lk be the set of large k-itemsets. For example, L3 might 
contain {{A, B, C}, {A, B, D}, {A, D, F},…}. Let Ck be the set 
of candidate k-itemsets; this is always a superset of Lk. Here is 
the Apriori algorithm [2]: 
L1 = {large 1-itemsets}; 
For(k=2;Lk-1 ? ? ;k++)do begin 
Ck=apriori-gen(Lk-1); 
Forall transactions t?D do begin 
Ct=subset(Ck,t); 
Forall candidates c?Ct do 
c.count++; 
end 
Lk={c?Ck|c.count ? minsup} 
End 
Answer = ? kLk; 
B. A Pseudo-association Rules 
In the Pseudo-association Rules, we can roughly consider 
the pseudo-association rule is converse one against an 
association rule.  
•  1 Find out the structure that consist of the known 
association rules and the initial structure, and represent it as 
a graph G (V, E), in which V represents the itemset and E 
represents relations between items.  
•  2 Calculating the support and confidence of association rule 
v(X, Y)?  V, where X, Y are the antecedent and consequent 
of the rule respectively, for the known association rules, we 
compare the support and confidence with maxsupport and 
maxconfidence respectively, then judging the existence of 
the relation. 
The pseudo-association rule algorithm is described as 
follows:  
Forall association rules v(X, Y) ?V do begins 
X.count =0;  
forall transactions t?D do begins  
If (x? t) then  
X.count++;  
If ((X? Y) ? t) then  
(X? Y). count++; 
end  
sup = (X? Y).count/D.count; 
conf = (X? Y).count/X.count; 
If (sup<maxsup or conf<maxconf) then //D.count is the  
                     // total number of transaction 
// in the database 
X ?> Y 
end 
C.  Example  
To illustrate the principle of the Pseudo-association rule, we 
consider an example database in Fig.2, in which we had 
already found the association between item {A} and {B} 
before. Now we verify whether this association is still exist. 
We set the maxsupport 0.2 and maxconfidence 0.4. First, we 
calculate the support 1-itemset shown in (2), the itemset {A} is 
3. Second, we get the support of 2-itemsets and {A, B} is 1, and 
then the confidence of 2-itemset is 1/3, which is lower than the 
maxconfidence.  
                                                                                                                                          3073

Just as the example has shown us that the association rule 
between items {A} and {B} is lower than the maxconfidence. 
Therefore, we can make a conclusion that the rule we have got 
before is not suitable any longer. 
IV. EXPERIMENTS 
In this paper, we make an experiment with the pseudo-
association rules to optimize the structure of the web site. 
As we know, designing a web site is a complex task [4]; we 
may use the pseudo-association rule to estimate the validity of 
the web site which is one of applications of pseudo-association 
rule. Now we take an experiment to evaluate the structure of 
one website by pseudo-association rules. Website designers 
must structure and present their content in a way that is clear 
and intuitive to users, or those users will become lost and 
disgruntled. Visitors to a site do not always have the same 
conceptual model of the material as the site’s designer.  
We regard hyperlinks between the pages of the web site as 
the rules and the pages as items. We experimented with the 
pseudo-association rule algorithm by using the web log data 
from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology. Web 
servers register a web log entry for every single access they get, 
recording important pieces of information: the URL requested, 
the IP address from which the request originated and a 
timestamp. A log entry is automatically added each time that a 
request for a resource reaches the Web Server (see Figure 3).  
 
Fig. 3. Fragment of a web log file from Website of Jiangxi 
University of Science and Technology 
The experiments were performed on a Dell PrecisionTM 
Workstation 370 clocked at 3.6 GHz.  
First, we scan the primitive hyperlink of the structure of the 
website, and analyze the hyperlink structure between the web 
pages of its website with the Pseudo-association Rules, and 
analyze that the log recorder of this website. We define the 
threshold maxsupport 0.1 and the maxconfidence 0.2. The 
pseudo-association rules is written in the form X ??Y|(c, s). 
Here, we list several experimental results. The results are as 
follows:  
1.   [kuandai2.htm] ? >and [thailand.htm] (0.02, 0.05). 
2.   [dep_sel.htm] ? > [first.htm] (0.1, 0.93).   
3.   [kuandai.htm] ? > [xgxx.htm] (0.01, 0.96). 
4.   [bg_xp.htm] ? > [05fszl.htm] (0.02, 0.40). 
In pseudo-association rule algorithm, every association rule 
which would be evaluated will be measured in one pass. 
Compare to the association rule, the pseudo-association rule 
has less time complexity. 
To estimate the accuracy of the pseudo-association rules 
about the support and confidence, first we use Apriori 
algorithm to calculate the support and confidence and compare 
them got by the pseudo-association rules on the same log 
recorder database. We found that the result of the pseudo-
association rules is the same as it of the association rules. So 
we conclude that the pseudo-association rules can do the work 
well. 
V. SUMMARIZATION AND THE FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we present pseudo-association rules based on 
the association rules, which is used to mine the un-reasonable 
relations between the data. Just like the association rule, we set 
two threshold factors, maxsupport and maxconfidence. If the 
support or confidence of the items is lower than the threshold 
of maxsupport or the maxconfidence respectively, we can tell 
that rule of these items is a pseudo-association rule. 
We discussed the algorithm of pseudo-association rules and 
use it to analyze the web structure of the Jiangxi University of 
Science and Technology.  
For the goods in the selling, the relation of commodity item 
is likely to change with the season and the different location of 
the shops. This kind of change occurs as well in the commodity 
dealing store. We should mine this change out through pseudo-
association rules so as to provide information for decision-
                                                                                                                                          3074
making of decision-maker. In optimizing the website, PAR can 
find out the web of being clicked or less clicked by customer in 
the hyperlink of the webs. Therefore, these hyperlinks can be 
rid of or modified to perfect the website. 
We do not yet consider another factor —  interest 
measure[6,7,8,9,10] in our paper, we will consider it in next 
research.
