Abstract—Humans frequently use a “divide and conquer” 
strategy to understand large volumes of data, by grouping similar 
items into progressively finer categories which form a conceptual 
hierarchy. Typically, such categories do not have crisp definitions 
but can be modelled by fuzzy set theory, allowing computers to 
represent and reason about sets of objects in a way that reflects 
the human interpretation of categories. Association rules are a 
useful tool in knowledge discovery from databases but are 
normally defined in terms of crisp rather than fuzzy categories. 
In this paper, we describe a new approach to finding association 
rules between fuzzy categories, based on mass assignment theory. 
In contrast to other fuzzy association methods, we retain a fuzzy 
confidence value rather than a point value.

I.  INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) 
Information overload and the explosion in production, 
transmission and consumption of data are well documented 
problems which contribute to the spread of digital obesity [1]. 
Often, much of the data relevant to a particular problem or 
decision is not held in a central, well-structured location, but is 
scattered over different repositories (personal filestores, web, 
networked databases, etc) and in many cases is held in 
unstructured or semi-structured formats. A recent report [2] 
estimated that over 80% of corporate information consists of 
unstructured text. Information can be drawn from diverse 
sources – for example, drawing from semi-structured text data 
such as emails, web fora, news archives, product manuals etc 
as well as more traditional databases, we may face tasks such 
as looking for recurring themes (e.g. complaints, questions, 
comments), highlighting emerging issues or linking queries 
with relevant answers. emails, intranets, the web, etc.  
Our previous work within a project entitled “Smart Queries 
and Adaptive Data” (SQuAD) is concerned with adding 
structure to data and refining approximate knowledge from this 
data (see [3-6] ). Our aim is to assist in the creation of useful 
information from diverse sources of semi-structured data - 
allowing extraction and integration from multiple sources of 
information and re-organisation based on an individual’s 
personal categories. The final stage is to look for strong 
associations between different (fuzzy) categories. 
Substantial research efforts in disparate areas such as very 
large databases, the semantic web, knowledge management, 
business intelligence, etc. have focused on the use of 
hierarchical approaches to categorise and summarise large 
quantities of data.  There is rarely a single unique hierarchy - 
instead, a human will choose the most appropriate way to split 
up the data according to their expertise / background 
knowledge and the problem at hand. The ability to group 
multiple entities together into an (approximately) uniform 
whole allows us to efficiently represent a whole group as a 
single concept, enabling us to reason, and to derive knowledge, 
about groups of entities. A simple form of derived knowledge 
is association  - essentially, that the extensions of two concepts 
overlap significantly. One of the fundamental tenets underlying 
fuzzy set theory [7] is the idea that humans work with groups 
of entities (or conceptual categories) that are loosely defined, 
able to admit elements according to some scale of membership 
rather than according to an absolute yes/no test.  
Association rules (in their crisp form) are a well-established 
technique for knowledge discovery in databases, enabling 
“interesting” relations to be discovered. There have been a 
number of proposals to develop fuzzy association rules, that is 
to discover the degree of association between fuzzy categories. 
Some of our recent work  has used mass assignment theory [8-
10] to develop a novel approach able to find a point valued 
association strength between fuzzy categories [11] and an 
interval-valued version [12]. 
In common with other work on fuzzy association rules, 
most of our previous work assumes there is a crisp value for 
the rule confidence. We note that much of the power of fuzzy 
approaches arises from the ability to produce fuzzy results, i.e. 
to effectively postpone the decision on whether a given 
element “belongs” to a set or not. For example, if a cooling fan 
is controlled by the rules  
if temperature is a little high, increase fan speed slightly 
     if temperature is a little low, decrease fan speed slightly 
then a traditional approach requires us to specify precise 
limits for the intervals “a little high” and “a little low”, and 
precise single values for a “slight” increase or decrease in 
speed. In contrast, a fuzzy control approach allows us to define 
fuzzy terms and propagate them through the inference, only 
converting to a crisp value at the final stage when a decision

must be made to change the fan speed. In a similar vein, we 
argue that in looking for association strengths between fuzzy 
categories, it is better to propagate the fuzziness through the 
calculation and produce a fuzzy value rather than a single value 
to represent the confidence. Our mantra is fuzzy in, fuzzy out. 
The main contribution of this paper is a novel mass 
assignment-based method for calculating a fuzzy confidence in 
associations between fuzzy categories. It relies on a new 
method of converting fuzzy relations to mass assignments and 
a definition of membership in the fuzzy confidence values 
related to the movement of mass needed to produce that 
association confidence value, relative to the confidence value 
derived from a least prejudiced mass assignment. The 
minimum and maximum values for the confidence can be 
found quickly, and memberships calculated based on the 
corresponding mass assignments. A full version, including 
proofs, will appear in a subsequent paper [21].  
II. FUZZY SETS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
Many authors (e.g. [13]) have proposed the use of fuzzy 
sets to model uncertain values in databases and other 
knowledge based applications. The standard interpretation of a 
fuzzy set in this context is as a possibility distribution - that is 
to say it represents a single valued attribute which is not known 
exactly. For example we might use the fuzzy set tall to 
represent the height of a specific person or low to represent the 
value shown on a dice. The fuzzy sets tall and low admit a 
range of values, to a greater or lesser degree; the actual value is 
taken from the range. Knowing that a dice value val is even 
restricts the possible values to val=2 XOR val=4 XOR val=6 
(where XOR is an exclusive or). If a fuzzy set on the same 
universe is defined as low = {1/1, 2/1, 3/0.4} then knowing the 
value val is low restricts the possible values to val=1 XOR 
val=2 XOR val=3 with corresponding memberships. 
The conjunctive interpretation of a fuzzy set occurs when 
the attribute can have multiple values. For example, a person 
may be able to speak several languages; we could model this as 
a fuzzy set of languages, where membership would depend on 
the degree of fluency. This is formally a relation rather than a 
function on the underlying sets. Our position is to make a 
distinction between the  conjunctive interpretation - modelled 
by a monadic fuzzy relation – and the disjunctive interpretation 
– modelled by a possibility distribution. To emphasise the 
distinction, we use the notation 
 F(a) = {x/µ(x) | x ? U}  
to denote a single valued attribute F of some object a (i.e. a 
possibility distribution over a universe U) and 
 R(a) = [x/?(x) | x ? U] 
to denote a multi-valued attribute (relation). Fuzzy 
categories represent the latter case, since we have multiple 
values that satisfy the predicate to a greater or lesser degree. 
A. Extending Association Rules to Fuzzy Categories 
In creating association rules within transaction databases 
(e.g. [14], see also [15] for a clear overview), the standard 
approach is to consider a table in which columns correspond to 
items and each row is a transaction. A column contains 1 if the 
item was bought, and 0 otherwise. The aim of association rule 
mining is to determine whether or not there are links between 
two disjoint subsets of items – for example, do customers 
generally buy biscuits and cheese when buying beer and wine? 
These disjoint subsets represent categories, as described earlier. 
Let I denote the set of items, so that any transaction can be 
represented as tr ? I, and consider X, the set of all transactions 
(strictly speaking, X is a multi-set but can be made into a set by 
adding a unique identifier to each transaction). We must also 
specify two categories (or itemsets) s and t, which are non-
empty, non-overlapping subsets of I, 
 t ? I  
 s ? I 
 s ? t  = ? 
and the sets of transactions containing s and t 
 
  
! 
S = x x " X # s$ x{ }
T = x x " X # t $ x{ }
 
 An association rule is of the form s => t and is interpreted 
as stating that when the items in s appear in a transaction, it is 
likely that the items in t will also appear i.e. it is not an 
implication in the formal logical sense. A slight abuse of 
notation allows us to use S => T or  s => t as the rule. 
Most authors use two measures to assess the significance of 
association rules. The support of a rule s => t  is the number 
(or relative number) of transactions in which both s and t 
appear, and the confidence of the rule is an estimate (based on 
the samples) of the conditional probability of t being contained 
in a transaction given that it contains s 
 
! 
Support s, t( ) = S"T  (1) 
 
! 
Conf s, t( ) =
S"T
S  (2) 
Typically a threshold is chosen for the support, so that only 
frequently occurring sets of items s and t are considered; a 
second threshold filters out rules of low confidence.

For example, consider a database of sales employees, 
salaries and sales figures. A mining task might be to find out 
whether the good sales figures are achieved by the highly paid 
employees. Given the database table in Fig 1, we can obtain 
rule confidences ranging from 1/3 up to 1 by different crisp 
definitions of “good sales” and “high salary”, as shown at the 
bottom of Fig. 1. Although this is a contrived example, such 
sensitivity to the cut-off points adopted for crisp definitions is a 
good indication that a fuzzy approach is more in line with 
human understanding of the categories. 
Various approaches to fuzzifying association rules have 
been proposed e.g. [15-17]. The standard extension to the fuzzy 
case is to treat the sets S, T as fuzzy and find the intersection 
and cardinality using a t-norm and sigma-count respectively.  
 
! 
Conf S,T( ) =
µS"T x( )
x#X
$
µS x( )
x#X
$
 (3) 
In the example of Fig 1, a fuzzy approach would categorise 
employees according to whether their salaries are high, (or 
medium or low) and also according to whether their sales 
figures are good, moderate or poor. Taking simple definitions 
for membership in  goodSales and highSalary leads to  
  S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2]   
and    
 T = [a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7] 
which gives a confidence of 0.72 for the association S=>T 
using eq. (3). 
As pointed out by [15], using min and the sigma count for 
cardinality can be unsatisfactory because it does not distinguish 
between several tuples with low memberships and few tuples 
with high memberships - for example,  
  
! 
S = x
1
1[ ]
T = x
2
1[ ]
 
leads to  Conf(S, T) = 0  but 
 
! 
S1 = x1 1, x2 0.01, x3 0.01,… , x1000 0.01[ ]
T1 = x1 0.01, x2 1, x3 0.01,… , x1000 0.01[ ]
 
leads to  
 
! 
Conf S1,T1( ) =
1000 " 0.01
1+ 999 " 0.01
# 0.91 
which is extremely high for two almost disjoint sets (this 
example originally appeared in [18]). Using a fuzzy cardinality 
(i.e. a fuzzy set over the possible cardinality values) is also 
potentially problematic since the result is a possibility 
distribution over rational numbers, and the extension principle  
[19] gives a wider bound than it should, due to neglect of 
interactions between the numerator and denominator in Eq 2. 
For example, given  
 S = [x1/1, x2/0.8]  
 T = [x1/1, x2/0.4]. 
the fuzzy cardinalities are  
 |S ? T | = {1/1, 2/0.4} ,  
 |S | = {1/1, 2/0.8}  
leading (by the extension principle) to a confidence of  
{0.5/0.8, 1/1, 2/0.4}.  
This is clearly incorrect as the confidence cannot be greater 
than 1, hence the extension principle is not appropriate here.  
III. FUZZY RELATIONS AS MASS ASSIGNMENTS 
As with previous work [12, 20] we start from the fact that a 
relation represents a conjunctive set of ordered n-tuples i.e. a 
conjunction of n ground clauses. For example, if U is the set of 
dice values then we could define a (crisp) predicate 
differBy4or5 on U × U as the set of pairs 
 [(1,6), (1,5), (2,6), (5,1), (6,1), (6, 2)] 
This is a conjunctive set, in that each pair satisfies the 
predicate. In a similar way, a fuzzy relation represents a set of 
n-tuples that satisfy a predicate to some degree. Thus 
differByLargeAmount could be represented by  
[(1,6)/1, (1,5)/0.6, (2,6)/0.6, (5,1)/0.6, (6,1)/1, (6,2)/0.6] 
The interpretation is not that a single pair satisfies this 
predicate, but that one set of pairs  satisfies it (out of several 
possible sets of pairs). Thus the mass assignment is on possible 
relations : 
  
This is equivalent to treating the fuzzy relation as a fuzzy 
set of crisp relations: 
  
Similarly, a monadic fuzzy predicate largeValue defines a 
set of 1-tuples such as [6/1, 5/0.8, 4/0.3] which is written as a 
fuzzy set of crisp relations: 
  
and has the mass assignment 
 
Our subsequent studies [20] show that this approach can 
sometimes overestimate the difference between full and nearly-
full membership, which can lead to unreasonably large 
intervals calculated for the confidence of association rules. For 
example, under this interpretation, the monadic fuzzy relation  
S = [a/1 b/0.98] 
has the mass assignment  
 
! 
m
S
= a[ ]{ } : 0.02, a[ ], a,b[ ]{ } : 0.98{ }  
The normal mass assignment interpretation allows us to 
redistribute the mass on {[a], [a,b]} to either of the relations 
[a] or [a,b] which leads to the family of distributions: 
The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference (NAFIPS2009)
Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009
 S = [a] : 1-x   ,   [a,b] : x     where 0 ? x ? 0.98 
This flexibility in re-assigning mass means that for a source 
relation  
S =  [a/1 b/0.98]  
and a target relation  
T =  [a/1 b/0.98  c/0.02]   
we get an interval [0.51, 1] which is surprisingly wide 
considering the two relations are so similar. We emphasise that 
this behaviour arises mostly in contrived cases and that smaller 
intervals are calculated in the vast majority of “real” 
association rules encountered in experimental studies e.g. [12].  
A. Alternative Interpretation of Relations as Mass 
Assignments 
 The approach discussed above, which we will refer to as an 
open world approach, treats partial membership of a tuple x in 
a relation R  (i.e. 0 < ?R(x) < 1)  as an upper bound for the mass 
that can be assigned to any set of tuples including x. This leads 
to a wide range of mass distributions that can be derived from 
the fuzzy relation R.  
In the open world approach, for any tuple x such that ?R(x) 
< 1, the total mass that can be assigned to relations containing x 
is given by 
 
! 
0 " m t( )
t= x1,…,xn[ ]
x# t
$ " %
R
x( )  
In the largeValue example above, consider the element 
x=5, which has ?R(x) = 0.8; the relations containing 5 are [5, 6] 
and [4, 5, 6] and we have  
0   ?    mlargeValue([5,6]) +  mlargeValue([4,5,6])  ?  0.8  
This gives a considerable degree of flexibility in assigning 
mass. The alternative interpretation used in this paper - the 
closed world approach - regards partial membership of a tuple 
x in a relation R (i.e. 0 < ?R(x) < 1) as strictly equal to the total 
mass assigned to the sets of tuples which include x, i.e.  
 
! 
m t( )
t= x1,…,xn[ ]
x" t
# = $
R
x( ) 
This means there is no flexibility in the range of mass 
distributions that can be derived from the fuzzy relation R. 
However, there is flexibility in the mass assignments when R is 
combined with an assignment corresponding to another 
relation, for example in calculating association confidences as 
described later. 
Under this interpretation, the monadic fuzzy relation 
largeValue  discussed above has 
 
! 
mlargeValue = 6[ ] : 0.2, 6,5[ ] : 0.5, 6,5,4[ ] : 0.3{ }  
and clearly  
  mlargeValue([5,6]) +  mlargeValue([4,5,6])  = 0.8  
B. Closed world Mass-based association rules 
For a source category  
  
and a target category  
  
we can define the corresponding mass assignments as 
follows. Let the set of distinct memberships in S be 
  
where 
  
 
and nS ? |S| 
Let  
 
! 
S
i
= x "
S
x( ) # "S
( i)[ ]{ }  
Then the mass assignment corresponding to S is  
 
where 
 (7) 
and we define  
  
For example, the fuzzy category  
 S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2] 
has the corresponding mass assignment 
! 
M
S
= a[ ] : 0.2, a,b[ ] : 0.3, a,b,c[ ] : 0.3, a,b,c,d[ ] : 0.2{ }
 
 
We can now calculate the confidence in the association 
between the categories S and T using mass assignment theory. 
In general, this is not a unique value as we are free to move 
mass (consistently) between the cells corresponding to Si  and 
Tj for each i, j.  
For two mass assignments  
 
! 
MS = Si :mS Si( ){ }, 1" i " nS
MT = Tj :mT Tj( ){ }, 1" j " nT
 the composite mass assignment is  
! 
M = M
S
" M
T
= X :m X( ){ }
 
where m is specified by the composite mass allocation 
function, subject to  
! 
mij
j=1
nT
" = mS Si( )           and   
 
! 
mij
i=1
nS
" = mT Tj( )  
This can be visualised using a mass tableau (see [8])  as 
shown in Figure 2. Each row (column) represents a relation of 
the source (target) mass assignment,. The mass associated with 
The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference (NAFIPS2009)
Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009
a row (column) can be distributed amongst the cells provided 
row and column constraints are satisfied. We label the rows S1, 
S2, … SnS   and columns  T1, T2, … TnT , and assign mass mij to 
cell (i, j) subject to row and column constraints. The 
confidence in the association rule is given by 
! 
conf M( ) =
mij " Si #Tj( )
i, j
$
mij " Si
j
nT
$
%

d = mij " Si

( 
) 
* 
i=1

$

i=1
nS
$ mS

(7)
 
Clearly n ? 0, d >0  and d is a constant for a given source 
relation S, irrespective of M. 
For example consider the fuzzy categories 
S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2]        and    
T = [a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7] 
The mass can be allocated in many ways, subject to row 
and column constraints. One notable assignment is the least 
prejudiced distribution, obtained by taking the product of 
source and target masses for each cell as shown in fig 2. This 
corresponds to the minimum entropy combination of the source 
and target mass assignments. Different assignments lead to the 
minimum and maximum confidences.

We take an arbitrary mass assignment M, and consider the 
change in confidence when we move mass to create another 
assignment M*. In order to conform to row and column 
constraints, the net transfer of mass within any row or column 
is zero. Thus the simplest transfer of mass involves four cells, 
as shown in fig 3. We refer to this as an elementary mass 
transfer, denoted  
    
and write 
 
where  indicates that mass x is moved 
into cells (i1, j1) and (i2, j2)  from cells  (i1, j2) and (i2, j1) and

It is possible to show [21] that maximum rule confidence is 
obtained by moving mass towards the diagonal (top left to 
bottom right) and that minimum confidence is obtained by 
moving mass towards the bottom left - top right diagonal.

C. Membership Function for Fuzzy Confidence 
We define the membership function in terms of the quantity 
of mass which must be moved (relative to the least prejudiced 
distribution). The least prejudiced distribution is our reference 
point, and the resultant confidence is taken to have membership 
= 1. Any other assignment of mass requires one or more 
elementary mass transfers relative to the LPD, and we are 
particularly interested in the mass assignments corresponding 
to minimum and maximum confidence, MMIN and MMAX. We 
define a fuzzy interval C representing the confidence such that 
! 
µC conf M( )( ) =1"
pos M
LPD
"M( )
N
 
where 
! 
N = max pos Mmax "MLPD( ), pos Mmin "MLPD( )( )
 
Because the membership function varies linearly with the 
amount of mass moved, it is triangular and can be calculated 
quickly by considering the end points. We note that it is 
possible for the membership function to be discontinuous at 
one end (i.e. to drop abruptly to zero). Figure 6 shows the 
membership function for the fuzzy confidence in the good sales 
- high salary example, with the calculations illustrated in 
figures 2, 4, and 5.

IV. SUMMARY 
Starting from the premise that fuzzy results should not be 
prematurely converted into crisp values, we have developed a 
method which returns a fuzzy confidence for the association 
between two fuzzy sets, interpreted conjunctively. To our 
knowledge, this is the only method that generates a fuzzy 
confidence value for association rules. The method was 
developed in the context of hierarchical analysis but is suitable 
to calculate the fuzzy association between any pair of fuzzy 
sets.
