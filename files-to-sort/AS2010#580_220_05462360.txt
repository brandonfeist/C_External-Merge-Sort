Abstract—Concept lattice represents knowledge with the 
relationships between the intent and the extent of concepts, and 
the relations between the generalization and the specialization of 
concepts, then knowledge can be shown on the Hasse diagram 
with hierarchical structure, thus it is properly applied to the 
description of mining association rules in databases. Compared 
with well-known Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm, mining 
association rules on concept lattice does not need to scan 
databases for many times, and shows association rules on the 
Hasse diagram of concept lattice more visual and concise, 
moreover, it can be used to mine association rules interactively 
according to user’s subjective interest, then solves the bottleneck 
of knowledge acquisition effectively, thus it is properly applied to 
the description of association rule mining in databases. Although 
the time complexity of building concept lattice algorithm is 
usually higher than FP-Growth algorithm, less than Apriori 
algorithm, association rule mining based on concept lattice has its 
own advantage,  which represents the association rules more 
vivid and concise than Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm, thus, it 
can be easily applied in molecular biology to manage and analyze 
biology data. For example, because DNA and protein sequences 
are essential biological data and exist in huge volumes as well ,it 
is very important to apply association rule mining to compare 
and align biology sequences and find biosequence patterns and 
discovery of disease-causing gene connections and gene-drug 
interactions as an effective method.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Association rule[1,2] mining is an important data mining 
method for determining consumer purchasing patterns in 
transaction databases. Nowadays, many applications have 
used to discover useful information. 
Concept lattice was presented by R. Wille[3], reflects 
entity-attribute relationships between objects, and represents 
knowledge shown with hierarchical structure on the Hasse 
diagram, thus it is properly applied to the description of 
association rule mining in databases. Apriori algorithm 
employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, 
where k-itemsets are used to explore(k+1)-itemsets, the set of 
frequent 1-itemsets is found by scanning the database to 
accumulate the count for each item, and collecting those items 
that satisfy minimum support. The resulting set is denoted L1. 
Next, L1 is used to find L2, the set of frequent 2-itemsets, 
which is used to find L3, and so on, until no more frequent k-
itemsets can be found. The finding of each Lk requires one of 
full scan of the database. The Apriori algorithm[4,5,6] is used 
to discover frequent itemsets in order to mine association rules 
from frequent itemsets.  
The shortcoming of Apriori algorithm is that it needs scan 
the database for many times in the course of finding frequent 
itemsets, and in the join step, to find Lk, a set of candidate k-
itemsets is generated by joining Lk-1 with itself, costs a great 
deal of CPU time. 
FP-growth(Frequent Pattern-growth)[7-13,27] adopts a 
divide-and-conquer strategy as follows. First, it compresses the 
database representing frequent items into frequent-pattern tree, 
which retains the itemsets association information, it then 
divides the compressed database into a set of conditional 
databases, each associated with one frequent item or “ pattern 
fragment” ,and mines each such database separately.  
A study on the performance of the FP-growth method 
shows that it is efficient and scalable for both long and short 
frequent pattern, and is magnitude faster than the Apriori 
algorithm.   
Bioinformatics is a promising young field that applies 
computer science and technology in the molecular biology and 
develops algorithms and methods to manage and analyze 
biological data. Because DNA and protein sequences are 
essential biological data and exist in huge volumes as well, it 
is important to develop effective methods to compare and 
align biology sequences and discover biosequence pattern. 
And, association rule mining is an effective method and 
algorithm to apply to bioinformatics. 
Association rules(or Genetic Association) in gene, 
biology sequences and biosequence patterns are mainly 
implemented using the method: On the basis of hypothesis-
driven theory, candidate gene analysis is directly connected 
with systemic knowledge of biological function, whereas a 
whole-genome association theoretically investigates the entire 
genome simultaneously[14,15]. However, there are few 
methods to analyze the entire genome for complex diseases 
have been established with respect to the availability of 
unbiased reliability and cost efficiency. Literature[16-21] has 
978-1-4244-5316-0/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE
developed a practical and efficient strategy for an extensive 
region-wide association with evenly spaced dense SNPs 
markers[16,17].  
In this paper, the contribute is that association rule 
mining based on concept lattice has been applied to discovery 
of disease-causing gene connections and gene-drug 
interactions as an effective method, and the Hasse diagram of 
concept lattice represents the association rules more visual, 
vivid and concise than Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm .  
The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we review 
the preliminaries of association rules, basic notions of concept 
lattice, association rule mining on concept lattice is described 
in section III, , an example of mining association rules based on 
concept  lattice is illustrated in section IV, finally, we reach the 
conclusion in section V. 
II. BASIC NOTIONS OF ASSOCIATION RULE  AND  CONCEPT 
LATTICE 
A. Basic notions of association rule 
Mining association rule is an important branch of data 
mining, which describes potential relations among data items 
(attribute, variant) in databases, The well-known Apriori 
algorithm was proposed by R. Agrawal et al., in 1993. Mining 
association rules can be stated as follows: 
   Let I={i1, i2, … ,im} be a set of items. Let D, the task-
relevant data, be a set of transactions, where each transaction 
T is a set of items such that T?I. The quantities of items 
bought are not considered. Each transaction is assigned an 
identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items, A transaction T 
is said to contain A if and only if A?T. An association rule is 
an implication of the form A?B, where A?I, B?I, and 
A?B=?. The rule A?B holds in the transaction set D with 
support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that 
contain A?B (i.e., both A and B). This is taken to be the 
probability, P(A?B). The rule A?B has confidence c in the 
transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D 
containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the 
conditional probability, P(B|A).  
That is, Support (A?B)=P(A?B)=s; 
Confidence(A?B)=P(B|A)=Support(A?B)/Support (A)=c. 
Association rule mining should be mining strong 
association rules that satisfy the user-specified both minimum 
support threshold and confidence threshold. 
B. Basic notions of concept lattice  
A context is defined as a triple C=(O,D,R?, where O is a 
set of objects, D is a set of attributes, and R is the binary 
relation between O and D, according to the inclusion relations 
between extents and intents, there is an unique ordered set that 
describes the structure of inherent lattice, which defines natural 
groupings and relationship descriptions between the objects 
and their attributes in the context, this structure is also known 
as (Galois) Concept Lattice[3,22](for short, CL). 
Definition 2.1: Each pair such as (A,B) derived from the 
context is called a concept, where A?P(O), B?P(D), and 
P(O), P(D) are the power sets of O and D respectively, A and 
B create a connection in terms of the following properties. 
A’={m?D|?g?A, gRm}, B’={g?O|?g?B, gRm}. 
Where A’=B, B’=A. A is called the extent of concept, 
and B is called the intent, denoted as Extent(C) and Intent (C) 
respectively. 
Definition 2.2: In a CL, partial order relation “< ” between 
concept C1=(A1, B1) and C2=(A2, B2) is defined as 
C1<C2?B2?B1, then C1 is the sub-concept (son) of C2, and C2 
is the sup-concept (father) of C1, that is, the relation between 
C2 and C1 is the relation as that of father and son.  
If C1<C2, there exists no a concept C=(A,B), such that 
satisfies C1<C<C2, C1<C2 is called a direct-sub-concept-direct-
sup-concept-relation between C1 and C2, the Hasse diagram of 
concept lattice is generated according to the partial order 
relation: If C1<C2 is a direct-sub-concept-direct-sup-concept, 
there exists an edge from C2 to C1. 
From the definitions, the hierarchical relations between the 
concepts are shown to us, which can be used as an efficient 
tool for data analysis and knowledge acquisition. And how to 
build concept lattice, please refer to the generation algorithm 
of concept lattice in literature[22]. 
III. MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON CONCEPT 
LATTICE 
As for concept C=(A, B) in a CL, we can introduce 
support(B)=|A|/M of intent B to concept C, M is the sum of 
transactions in D, |A| is the extent cardinal of concept C. 
Definition 3.1: If Support (B) of concept C in a concept lattice 
is big than the support threshold, the concept C is called a 
frequent concept, where intent B of concept C is frequent 
items. 
Theorem 3.1: Frequent items is corresponding to the intents 
of concepts lattice each other.  
Theorem 3.2: If C=(A, B) is a concept in a concept lattice, the 
support of B is |A|/M, where |A| is the extent cardinal of C, M 
is the sum of transactions in D. If B is frequent itemsets whose 
support is bigger than the support threshold, B must be a 
group of equivalent intents of the concepts. 
According to the theorems mentioned above, association 
rules mining based on concept lattice should abide by the 
theorems as follows[23-25]: 
Theorem 3.3: If concepts C1=(A1,B1), C2=(A2,B2) satisfy 
C2?sup(C1), we can min association the rule: B2 ? B1-B2, its 
confidence is |A1| / |A2|, otherwise, B1-B2 ? B2, its confidence 
is 100%. 
Theorem 3.4 If concepts C1=(A1,B1)?C2=(A2,B2) do not 
satisfy C2?sup(C1), and there exists nonempty common 
maximum-sub-concept C=(A,B), namely, ?C’=(A’,B’), which 
makes C? sup(C’)?C1?sup(C’)?C2?sup(C’) true, there are 
association rules between B1 and B2: B1?B2, B2? B1, their 
confidences are |A|/|A1|, A|/|A2| respectively. 
        
        
IV. AN EXAMPLE OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON 
CONCEPT LATTICE 
From the definitions and theorems above mentioned, we 
can mine association rules on concept lattice. Taking a typical 
Example as market basket analysis on page 236 in literature 
[26], There are nine transactions and 5 items in this 
ALLELectronics  transaction database D, that is M=9. Here, 
assumed that there are nine gene sequences(namely,9 
transactions), and the longest sequence is 5 genes(namely,5 
items) in each gene sequences, less than 5 genes is permissible. 
Next , we want to know how  the 
5 genes are arranged in a 
particular order, then find each 
sequence with a unique role in 
cellular function, such as disease-
causing gene connections and 
gene-drug interactions by the 
method of association rule 
mining based on concept lattice.  
 According to the items in 
Table I, the Hasse diagram of 
concept lattice can be built as 
shown in Figure 1. 
The support of frequent itemsets is not divided by M=9 in 
order to be convenient for explanation. We can easily obtain 
frequent itemsets, for example, such as the support of frequent 
itemsets {I1} is the extent cardinal of concept({145789},{I1}), 
whose support is 6,thus,the rest may be deduced by analogy, 
the support of frequent itemsets {I2} is the extent cardinal of 
concept({1234689},{I2}), whose support is 7; the support of 
frequent itemsets {I3} is the extent cardinal of concept 
({356789}, {I3}), whose support is 6; the support of frequent 
itemsets {I1I2}, {I1I3},{I2I3},{I2I4,I4} is 4, 4, 4, 2 respectively, 
the support of frequent itemsets {I1I2I3}, {I1I2I5,I5}, {I1I2I4} is 
2,2,1 respectively.[26] 
 Similarly, we can generate association rules from the 
Hasse diagram in diagram, for example, association rule I1?
I2?I5, the support of frequent itemsets {I1I2} and {I1I2I5,I5} is 
4,2 respectively, then the confidence of association rule I1?
I2?I5 is 2/4, as such I2?I5?I1,I1?I2?I5,I2?I1?I5, whose 
confidence is 2/2,2/6,2/7 respectively. However association 
rule I2?I5?I1, Since concept {I2I5} does not exist, there exists 
an common maximum-sub-concept {I1I2I5,I5}, whose support 
is 2, we can obtain the association rule I2? I5?I1,whose 
confidence is 2/2. The results are the identified with Apriori to 
generate association rules.  
   Association rule is applied to biosequence pattern, which 
has mostly advantages over rough set[27], Apriori algorithm 
and FP-growth, we can easily  find the biosequence on the 
Hasse diagram of concept lattice, and the display pattern is 
very visual, and concise for us to see the genes, nucleotides 
and amino acids occur in nature with different probabilities. 
As shown in Figure I, taking the 3 concepts ({1234689}, 
{I2}), ({356789},{I3}) and  ({3689}, {I2I3}) as an example, 
Gene I2 and I3  generate a new gene sequence  Gene I2I3, as for 
Gene I2 and I3 ,which occur in nature with different 
probabilities,  4/7 for Gene I2,  and 4/6 for Gene I3 respectively, 
4, 7, 6 are the support of frequent itemsets{I2I3},{I2} and {I3} 
respectively, namely, in turn are the extent cardinal of concept 
({1234689}, {I2}), ({356789}, {I3})  and  ({3689}, {I2I3}). On 
the other hand, from the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, we 
can clear watch the biosequence pattern relationships, easily 
find ancestor-child relations and probabilities of biosequence, 
for example, concept ({3689}, {I2I3}) is the common child of 
concept ({1234689},{I2}), ({356789}, {I3}) , and. concept 
({3689}, {I2I3}) is the ancestor of concept ({89},{I1I2I3}), and 
({8},{I1I2I3I5}), concept ({89}, {I1I2I3} is the father of concept 
({8},{I1I2I3I5}). 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, from the above discussion, we can reach the 
conclusion: From itemsets(intents of concept lattice), we can 
intuitively generate association, easily find the biosequence 
pattern relations on the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, the 
approach is visual, vivid and concise, users can interactively 
discover useful association rules in Hasse diagram of concept 
lattice according to his interest, improve the efficiency of 
mining, avoid the blindness. 
Mining association rules on concept lattice does not need 
to scan databases for many times, shows association rules on 
the Hasse diagram of concept lattice more visual and concise, 
moreover, it can be used to mine association rules interactively 
according to user’s subjective interest, then solves the 
bottleneck of knowledge acquisition effectively, thus it is 
properly applied to the description of association rule mining 
in databases. Although the time complexity of building 
concept lattice algorithm is usually higher than FP-Growth 
algorithm, less than Apriori algorithm, association rule mining 
based on concept lattice has its own advantage, which 
represents the association rules more vivid and concise than 
Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm, thus, it is very important to 
apply association rule mining to compare and align biology
