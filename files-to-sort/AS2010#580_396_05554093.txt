 Abstract - The inhabited environments are MIMO, 
uncertainly, and nonlinear complex systems. This paper presents 
a novel intelligent fuzzy agent(IFA) based on input-output 
associational algorithm for intelligent inhabited environments. 
An input-output dynamic associational algorithm based on Hebb 
learning is proposed, which can divide a complex system into 
multiple simple systems and eliminate the irrelevant data from 
the learning data to improve the learning rate. The IFA learns 
the user’s preferences according to the manually operation of the 
user and proactively controls the environments. Initially the IFA 
extracts the membership functions and fuzzy rules from the data 
captured. After that the IFA learns the membership functions 
and optimizes the fuzzy rules online when the user’s preferences 
change. The experience results show that the proposed system is 
effective.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The inhabited environments are constituted by building 
objects (such as lighting, HVAC and other equipments). The 
intelligent inhabited environments are living spaces equipped 
with embedded intelligent technology that would gather 
information from sensors (and other computers) and make 
decisions according to intelligent methods. The intelligent 
inhabited environments have the characteristics of ubiquity, 
transparency and intelligence[1]. It is hard to build the 
mechanistic models for inhabited environments due to the fact 
that the inhabited environments are MIMO, uncertainly, and 
nonlinear complex systems. So it is vital to build the 
mathematical models according to the input-output data 
captured from the systems. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy 
control system which is build according to the input-output 
data and embedded in the intelligent agent. The system can 
learn the user’s preferences online according to the users’ 
manually operation and proactively control the intelligent 
inhabited environments. However, if the dimensions of inputs 
and outputs are great, the complex of model will increase 
greatly.  In literature [2], the fuzzy agent learned the fuzzy 
rules according to all the inputs and outputs, which leaded to 
larger fuzzy rules. To a really MIMO complex system, 
generally not all the inputs associate with the outputs. For 
example, the temperature information indoor is useless for 
light control in intelligent inhabited environments. Hence, 
finding the most relevant associations between inputs and 
outputs is very vital that will eliminate the unnecessary and 
redundant associations. A dynamic associational algorithm for 
MIMO based on Hebb[3] is proposed, which can divide the 
complex environment system into multiple simple sub-
systems and eliminate the irrelevant data from the learning 
dataset to improve the learning rate. The presented intelligent 
fuzzy agent can learn the user’s preferences online according 
to the user’s manually operation and proactively control the 
intelligent inhabited environments. The presented methods can 
maximize the environment’s comfort and reduce the human 
machine interaction, while reducing the computational and 
communication complexity.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents the adapting intelligent fuzzy agent. Section 3 
presents the dynamic associational algorithm of input-output. 
The experiments and results will be present in Section 4. 
Finally, section 5 will summarize the work.

illumination for desired values, the IFA records the current 
state information, learns the user’s preference according to the 
operation, and then modifies or adds fuzzy rules. The IFA 
includes four phases: (1) Capturing and associating input-
output data. (2) Extracting fuzzy rules. (3) Agent control. 
(4) .Modifying fuzzy rules online. 
 
A   Capturing and Associating Input-Output Data  
The input and output vectors of the IFA can be defined 
as 1 2[ , , , , ]i nX x x x x= " "  and 1 2[ , , , ]j mY y y y y= " "  
respectively, 1, 2, ,i n= " ; 1, 2, ,j m= " . The states of 
the devices used to control the environmental comfort initially 
are off. When the user overrides the actuators, the agent 
records the data of the sensors and actuators and acquires an 
item learning information. The associational weights of input-
output are calculated at the same time. After a period of time 
the IFA has captured enough input-output data  
{ }, , 1,2,k k kZ X Y k N= = " . Due to the fact that the multi-
input multi-output fuzzy rules can be divided into multiple 
multi-input single-output fuzzy rules, ultimately, the learning 
data can be divided into m learning subsets based on input-
output associational algorithm 
 
B  Extracting Fuzzy Rules 
Multiple fuzzy rule sub-bases can be extracted according to 
the multiple data subsets. Supposing the first data subset is 
{ }1 1 1 1, , 1,2,k k kZ X Y k N= = " , 1 1 2 1[ , , , , ]i nX x x x x= " "  , 
1 1Y y= , which means there are 1n inputs associated with 
the 1y . The extraction of one fuzzy rule sub-base is as follow.   
1) Membership Function Construction: The learning of 
membership functions adopts fuzzy clustering method. The 
FCM[4] is a good fuzzy clustering method for the central 
value learning. Firstly confirming the domain of discourse 
[ximin,ximax] of the input output variables, then making 
normalization.

The multidimensional space is simplified into multiple 
single dimensional spaces for the sake of simplifying 
algorithms. The clustering number of every input and output 
variables general is five or seven. The input-output data are 
clustered based on FCM fuzzy clustering method, and finally 
the clustering centres are acquired. The mathematical 
algorithms of the FCM are

Where, ? is the maximum overlap between two adjacent 
fuzzy sets. 
2) Rule Construction: The fuzzy rules adopt Mamdani 
model[5] in the following form.  
Ri:  If 1x is 1
iA  and 2x  is 2
iA and…and 1nx  is 1
i
nA  
then 1y  is 1
iB   
Where, 1, 2, ,i l= " , i is the index of rules and l  is the 
number of rules.  
The extracting method of fuzzy rules is based on Mendal-
Wang[6].  
To one input-output data pair { }1 1,X Y , calculating the 
membership function value ( )q

Let * 1 2( ) max{ ( ), ( ), , ( )}q k j

fuzzy rule is generated as follows:  
If 1x  is
*
1
qA  and…and 1nx is 1
q
nA
* then y is y . 
If the number of data pairs is 1N , then the 1N  fuzzy rules 
will be generated. However, some of them are redundant, and 
some of them are contrary. Here the fuzzy rules are divided 
into multiple groups. One group includes the fuzzy rules that 
3009
have the same antecedent. We assume that there are l groups, 
and group P has pN  rules in the following form: 
If 1x  is
*
1
qA  and…and 1nx is 1
q
nA

Ultimately the 1N  fuzzy rules can be combined into l fuzzy 
rules. 
 
C  Agent Fuzzy Control 
     As mentioned above, the IFA has learned the user’s 
preference and extracted the fuzzy rules according to the 
input-output data pairs captured. Next the IFA can proactively 
control the environment based on the user’s desires. The fuzzy 
control adopts singleton fuzzification, max-product 
composition, product implication, and height defuzzification. 
The relation of input-output is as follow:

??
                  ?7? 
Where, *py is the maximal value of the corresponding 
fuzzy membership function.  
 
D  Online Adaptive Learning Algorithm 
   The user’s preferences usually change over time, so the IFA 
needs to continually learn the changes of the user’s 
preferences. If the IFA does not meet the user’s desires, the 
user will manually operate the corresponding devices. At the 
moment, the agent records the states ),( yx  of sensors and 
actuators. For the sake of avoiding the impulsion or the wrong 
action, the agent begins the learning process when the same 
records are twice. The weight of every rule is calculated based 
on the membership function values of the input linguistic 
variables. If 0iw > , the rule is fired. If the user’s manual 
operation is y , let 
* 1 2( ) max{ ( ), ( ), , ( )}q kjB BB Bu y u y u y u y= " . 
The online adaptive learning algorithm is as follows: 
(1) If manual operation = 1, record the input-output data 
P and fuzzificate them.  
(2) For each fired rule R, compared with the rule P, if the 
rule R = rule P, then increase the degree of R. If the 
antecedents of rule are the same as the consequents of 
rule are different, then decrease the degree of the rule. 
If the degree of R is zero, then remove the rule R. 
(3) If all the fired rules are different with the rule P, then 
add a new rule. Calculating the maximal membership 
function values * ( )q
i
iA
u x and * ( )q
j
jB
u y  of the input-
output variables, then the new fuzzy rule is as follow.   
If 1x  is
*
1
qA  and 2x is
*
2
qA and…and 1nx is 1
q
nA
*  
then 1y is
*
1
qB .  
If the degree of one rule decreases to zero, the rule has no 
effect on the system and is removed. This keeps the rule base 
small and simple.   
 III   DYNAMIC ASSOCIATIONAL ALGORITHM  
Here, taking the environment system as a black box, the 
inputs of the system are the states of the environment. The 
outputs of the system are the inhabitants’ actions. Conforming 
all the input variables and output variables in intelligent 
inhabited environments, let ],,[ 21 nxxxX "=  
and ],,[ 21 myyyY "= . Here, X  is the input vector.Y  is 
the output vector.  
On the basis of the Hebb network, the intelligent 
associational weight matrix algorithm is as follows.  
Step1: Initiate the associational weight matrix w , set

Step2: Initiate the input association flag

association flag vector 0],,[
21

nyyyY
???? " , and 
initiate the learning rate 1.0=? .  
Step3: In the occasion of generating one event, updating the 
flag bits of inputs changed from 0 to 1. For example, if ix  and 
jx  changed while the others remain consistently, then

Fig 2 Association curves of  the different inputs to AC
set 1=xi? , 1=xj?  and the other bits remain 0. At the same 
time, updating the flag bits of outputs changed from 0 to 1.  
Step 4: Calculate the new associational weight values, the 
formula is as follow: 
Y
T
X
kk ww ???? +?= ?1)1(                   (8) 
Here, 1?kw  is the associational weight matrix of last time. 
0 1?< <  is the forgetting factor. If the value of?  is great, it 
is easy to forget the old information and remember the new 
information. Adding forgetting factor in algorithm can prevent 
the associational weights calculated to increase endlessly. 
When an association are strong at the beginning and decrease 
over time, the corresponding associational weight value might 
decrease over time. 
Step 5: Reset 0=X? , 0=Y? , return to step 3 and wait 
for one new event.  
The frequencies of events are different. It is obvious that the 
frequency of light adjusting is higher than the frequency of the 
air-condition adjusting. The lower the frequencies of events 
are, the less the associational weights are. To overcome the 
defects, the associational weight matrix is normalized 
according to horizontal direction. 
Step1: calculate the base vectors of associational weights

Here, iq is the weights sum of input jx  to all outputs.

Here, the sum of weights in every line of the matrix is 1, 
and the influence of different frequencies to matrix is 
eliminated. The weight of matrix really means the influence 
degree of one input to one output. Set a threshold ? , if 
the ijw ?? , then the input ix  is associated with the jy . On 
the other hand if the ijw ?< , then the input ix  is irrelevant 
or redundant with the jy  and would become a candidate to be 
removed. 
IV. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT 
In the experiment room, there are one desk and one bed, and 
there are a light in the ceiling, a lamp on the desk, and a lamp 
beside the bed. Moreover, there are air-condition, auto 
window, and auto curtain. Wireless sensor networks[7] are 
distributed in the room. The inputs include temperature sensor 
indoor(TI), temperature sensor outdoor(TO), luminance sensor 
indoor(LI), luminance sensor outdoor(LO), chair pressure 
sensor(PC), and bed pressure sensor(PB). There are six output 
control devices. Besides the three lights( respectively, ceiling 
light L1, table lamp L2, bed lamp L3), there are an air 
condition(AC), an auto curtain(ACur), and an auto 
window(AW). The three lights are all adjustable. The air 
condition is variable frequency. Auto curtain and auto window 
are on-off control. Under different environment conditions, the 
experimenter operates the corresponding devices according to 
his preferences. The experiment was executed five successive 
days and acquired 280 leaning data. The input vector is

rules extracting methods, 56 fuzzy rules are derived. The 
learning error RMS (Root Mean Square) is 0.1214. After 
association, the AC learning data decrease to 86, which only 
include two inputs (TI, TO).  12 fuzzy rules are derived. The 
learning error RMS is 0.1147. Moreover, the total rule 
numbers are cut down and the leaning efficiency is improved 
tremendously. 
Now, adopting the same 280 learning data, the novel IFA 
method compared with the multilayer perception (MLP) 
neural network without input-output association. We tested 
our IFA learning method with different numbers of fuzzy sets, 
which generates MIMO Mamdani FLCs that represent the 
rules in a more descriptive human readable form. The MLP 
back-propagation neural network was tested with different 
numbers of hidden nodes in a single hidden layer. Table 1 
illustrates the RMS for the two methods over the sample data. 
The results show that the optimum number of fuzzy sets for 
IFA is 7. From the table 1, the MLP method gives a higher 
scaled RMS than the IFA methods. It is particular importance 
that the MLP method can not be adapted online as it needs to 
repeat its time-consuming learning cycles if a new behavior is 
to be added. Our method does not need to calculate iteratively 
which can then be adapted online in a life-long mode in a non 
intrusive manner.

V  CONCLUSION 
This paper presents a novel IFA system based on intelligent 
dynamical association algorithm which can be used to learn 
the user’s preferences and proactively control the 
environment. The weights between the inputs and outputs are 
continuously computed and updated in the occurrence of an 
event. The weights will increase when both the corresponding 
inputs and outputs simultaneously change. In contrast the 
weights will decrease over time when the corresponding 
inputs and outputs do not simultaneously changed and become 
irrelevant. The adaptive fuzzy system of IFA includes four 
phases, respectively, capturing and associating input-output 
data, extracting fuzzy rules, agent control, and online 
modifying fuzzy rules. The proposed fuzzy learning method 
can lean the use’s behaviours in a life-long mode and 
proactively control the inhabited environments. The proposed 
intelligent dynamical associational algorithm can result in 
decreasing the rule base which can lead to fewer memory 
requirements and faster processing, and reducing the 
computational and processing complexity while not 
decreasing the quality of the system.
