Abstract-This paper proposes a new method 
of data mining called Association Network 
(AE), combining the association analysis 
and sequential pattern. After having AE 
positioned in terms of time and quantity, it 
could be used to control inventory without 
main plans. AE is proved to be able to 
improve the efficiency of inventory control 
though simulation and test on inventory 
data. Besides, this paper also builds a 
framework of decision support system 
which can improve the performance of 
inventory control by making full use of AE.

?.  INTRODUCTION 
Data Mining has been widely used in 
business application. However there is relatively 
scarce literature on data mining application in 
inventory management. Xiao, Chang and Guo 
(2008) examined the project importance 
evaluation under the cross-effects, their paper 
presents an ”Expect the amount of Occupation” 
index by the association as well as a new ABC 
classification of inventory. Besides, Ma has also 
introduced the associated rules into the goods 
classification in customs declarations audit, 
aiming to find the relationship between the 
declaration of goods and classification with the 
Apriori algorithm. On the other hand, for last 
few decades, there has been a lot of achievement 
made in research of the inventory control theory. 
The optimal economic lot size models solve the 
problem of the most cost-effective order number 
and order quantity, Corporate MRP solve 
problem of arrangements for the production of 
materials procurement and inventory. 
Just-in-time aims to reduce the production 
uncertainty by establishing a good relationship 
with suppliers, and thereby reducing the 
inventory. However, due to various reasons, 
these inventory management methods have 
already emerged a variety of constraints and 
disadvantages. Little data mining literature in 
inventory control.  
 
Data mining can help solve the complicated 
issues like the huge amount of data as well as the 
internal relationships. However, there are many 
problems if we use the existing classical 
algorithm for data mining in inventory control. 
In this paper, we will select an appropriate 
mining algorithm and modify it for inventory 
control models. Therefore, a new method of data 
mining called association network will prove 
efficiency and flexibility. 
 
?.   ASSOCIATION NETWORK 
 
Stock data and flow data constitute an 
inventory database since different materials and 
their time of using has a wide range of uncertain 
relevance. As the materials commonly used in 
the production have frequent records while some 
                                                                                                                                          3906

materials may occur once in the inventory 
database. Considering of the characteristics, 
methods like simple association rules, sequential 
patterns mining as well as the traditional 
time-series model or a more advanced support 
vector regression and random forest regression 
will not well solve the problem of forecasting on 
inventory data. Construction steps of association 
network: 
 
A.   Preliminary Work 
Firstly, divide the database into several 
sub-libraries. Make sure materials within the 
same sub-division of library has strong 
correlation while not strong correlation between 
different sub-libraries. Secondly, association 
rules and sequential patterns mining on each 
library, we can get correspondingly A-Rule base 
and S-Rule base.  
 
B.  Construction of Association Networks 
For every sub-libraries, construction steps 
are alike. They are Initial main path selection, 
Branch generation and then Branch pruning 
 
Time positioning  
Time interval between the various elements 
needed determining if we use the above 
association network into inventory control. The 
data sample shows that transaction 
corresponding to each rule takes on different 
time interval, sometimes even great difference. 
Therefore, a more robust statistics is required. 
Considering the material’s time interval 
distribution is skewed to the right at most of the 
time, trimmed mean is a better choice. We use 
30% unequal trimmed mean,  that is remove the 
smallest 5% and the largest 25%of the 
transaction. Here we have an example, see as 
follows. Diagram shows the sequential pattern 
rules’ time interval: requisitioned materials’’ 
antifreeze cream\DingJiaYi 1*4\” then “line 
gloves\21*9 Unit\”

Obviously, the time interval is not 
concentrated, distributed in a segment from 5 
days to 65 days. 5% of quantile is 7.0000000, 
while 75% of quantile is 35.0000000, 10% of 
censored quantile is 18.823333. So count the 
interval as 19 days if ignoring decimals. 
 
Quantity positioning  
One more step can we use the network in 
demand forecasting, that’s determination the 
quantitative relationship. Using ratio or fitting 
linear regression is a proper way. Same example 
from above. Consideration of outliers, we use 
the 20% trimmed mean.

The ratio is mostly concentrated in 0.2 to 0.6, 
with the truncation average of 0.341759. That is, 
if the demand of gloves is 100 then the next will 
be demand of 35 sets of antifreeze cream in 19 
days. With this quantitative relationship in 
network, we can easily provide information on 
quantity and timing of future demand. 
 
?.   APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION 
NETWORK IN INVENTORY CONTROL 
 
Here we use a real data empirical analysis to 
investigate whether the association network can 
                                                                                                                                          3907

improve the inventory management performance. 
The data sample was taken from the Henan 
Olifield‘s SAP system of China Sinopec. Data is 
mainly consisted of two parts, one is warehouse 
materials payment flow from October 31,2005 to 
March 17,2009. The other is warehouse stock of 
March 17, 2009.  
 
A.  Association Rules Mining 
 
First, let the “cost center” as the ID variable, 
mobile type as ZT5, that defines the sending 
materials to cost center as a pick-up activities, 
and materials code as the target variable. 
Secondly, divide all the transactions from 
October 31, 2005 to March 17, 2009 into the 
same time point in accordance with the date. 
Different to customer shopping behavior, the 
demanded materials in warehouse are not picked 
up in the point time but always removed in a 
period of time, according to production 
schedules. Therefore, we should consider the 
point time as a period of time. Here we take 10 
days as a period time, materials picked up within 
10 days is counted as a “blanket”. Mining 
individually on a random sample of 50 time 
periods, SAS EM association node would be of 
great help. The parameters we set is minsup of 
20%, minconf of 10%. From the results of 50 
models, we select the results of confidence level 
greater than 20% and support more than 10% as 
rules. 
 
B.  Sequential Pattern Mining 
 
Let the “cost center” as the ID variable, 
mobile type as ZT5, that’s define the sending 
materials to cost center as a pick up activities , 
materials code as the target variable, and the 
pick up data as sequential variables. Sequential 
data mining on all the 137,986 records set both 
minsup and minconf 10%. 
 
C.  Association Network 
 
We establish the inventory control association 
network based on the above association and 
sequential rules. Besides, two exogenous 
variables required setting parameter: minimum 
support and maximum width. As shown below, 
box represent a node material, arrows represent 
the main path. Information included in box is the 
material code, description, calculated demand 
time frame as well as upstream materials and the 
ratio between the quantity of materials. In the 
vicinity of arrows, S indicates the rule’s support 
while C indicates the rule’s confidence. As we 
can see, the depth of main path is 5, maximum 
width is 2. Up to two-layer hierarchy, a 
pre-determined minsup of 10%,minconf of 40%. 
Then the overall support for the main path is 
10.43%, confidence is 75%. 
 
 
D.  Simulation and Test 
 
                                                                                                                                          3908

Still use the example above. We take 
anti-freeze cream as the input node. On one hand, 
the time picking up the cream is relatively 
determined, on the other hand, the sequence with 
anti-freeze cream as starting point has relatively 
high support. Therefore, anti-freeze cream as the 
input node is appropriate. Input the information 
of actual storage and requisition records, then 
simulate the procurement plan of the other 
materials on the network. Supposing that the 
materials can be obtained instantly and generate 
a new storage date and quantity while requisition 
information remains as the original data. Here 
we get the turnover rate, calculated from 
simulated data and original data.

5677990180001002 Sorghum broom\medium\ 
5677990460009002 Cottom mop\1.2kg 
 
As we can see from the above table, for most 
of the materials, the turnover days has been 
reduced. Wool-like material pants, transparent 
soap and some have very obvious improvement. 
Sorghum broom is the only one whose turnover 
days get a slight increase than before. In order to 
better illustrate the changes in inventory 
turnover days, we get further statistical test.

The test agrees with the results that inventory 
turnover days of these materials in the network 
have decreased. It means association network do 
have significant effect in inventory control. 
 
?.   INVENTORY MANAGEMENT 
SUPPORT SYSTEM BASED ON 
ASSOCIATION NETWORK 
 
Follow the ways of establishing and using 
association network, we can design an 
appropriate inventory management decision 
support system which can be embedded into the 
existing ERP or MRP system. If done, people 
may get better knowledge management and 
more convenient inventory planner. We try as 
you can see below. 
 
 
After starting the inventory management 
decision support system, input the information of 
the node, including the specific time of the needs, 
quantity. If the date between the system and the 
starting node of the main path are far in distance, 
you should use the latest material information as

the initial information. Pre-process module calls 
in the inventory stock data in association 
network, and searches the needed materials’ 
code, stock and demand quantity. Then it goes to 
the inference agency of which the function has 
been described above. Ways the planner can take 
are, no procurement plan (with external 
information that there is no need of the 
materials), make the procurement plan follow 
the tips (the tips are reasonable), make the 
procurement plan but partly refer the tips (the 
tips somewhat reasonable and there is some 
other more clearly information like quantity), 
delay the decision (not clear sure of whether we 
should purchase or a clear idea of the demand 
after this date). At last, the system output the 
procurement plan as the way what the planner 
input.    
 
?.   SUMMARY 
 
Though information is critical resources for 
enterprise especially in increasingly fierce 
competition, for the today’s enterprise, the 
problem is not lack but how if the manager 
manage and make good use of the information. 
In this paper, we establish an inventory 
association network, both simulation and test 
prove its efficiency. As we can see, model used 
in Information management should not only 
re-model by the result but also adapt to the 
specific background, what’s more, updating is of 
great importance since knowledge is always on 
the way and needs to modify. 
 
However, there are still some shortcomings 
in our study. May it can take as a reference for 
the future researchers. First, when mining the 
inventory data with association rule and 
sequential pattern, there is no much 
consideration of the hierarchy. Since some 
materials can replace each other while other 
materials are irreplaceable. The consideration of 
hierarchy is appropriate. Though the hierarchy 
association rule can improve the situation, there 
is difficulties in identify relationship from huge 
amount of inventory data. Secondly, it is still 
worth discussing how to divide database into 
sub-libraries. Different divisions can have 
different effects on the network performance. In 
the end, whether or not can the association 
network be applicable to other business area 
such as network marketing, etc.
