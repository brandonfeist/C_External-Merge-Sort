Abstract—Aiming at the phenomenon of road traffic accident 
frequency, a method of road traffic accidents causes analysis 
based on data mining was put forward. First analyzed the 
related attributes and causes of road traffic accidents. Then 
introduced two kinds of basic theory of data mining : rough sets 
theory and the theory of association rules. Finally proposed the 
method of road traffic accidents causes analysis based on data 
mining. Using the method of traffic data analysis, can improve 
the road traffic safety management level effectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Road traffic is an indispensable important part to life, but 
the frequent road accidents bring serious bodily harm and loss 
of property[1]. Each side of road traffic accidents contains a 
large amount of information and data is the most common 
form of the most important information records. Via mining 
the data of road traffic accident, we can analysis accident 
characteristics in multi-angles, multi-level and more 
comprehensive, and discover potential rules[2]. Meanwhile 
improving road traffic safety is the main content of intelligent 
transportation system and it has guiding significance to the 
design of intelligent transportation system. 
II. ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS ANALYSIS 
A. Attribute analysis 
The data of traffic accidents comes from the scene 
investigation[3]. One accident treatment including: when 
accident happens, according to the situation of the field survey 
and analysis, mark the scene of the accident and related to the 
accident feature extraction of data, such as time, weather, 
accident incident surface morphology, and the accident 
casualties of data. And by asking about the scene of the 
accident, understand the course of the accident. 
Traffic accident data is the foundation of traffic accident 
cause analysis. Based on the ministry of public security 
database of traffic accident analysis we can find that [4]: traffic 
accident data presented to radial and multi-dimensional 
three-dimensional structure, multi-level super. Each road 
traffic accidents records contain multiple data attributes. Each 
attribute value reflected an characteristic in a traffic accident. 
And the more data attribute data constitute the multiple 
dimensions of traffic accidents. In addition, data attributes are 
set from the basic accident information, personnel information, 
vehicle information, road information and environmental 
information, so that the data attributes and the five 
perspectives( people, vehicles , road, environment and the 
basic information) form two levels in logical, which the five 
perspectives( people, vehicles , road, environment and the 
basic information) are the top level and the data attributes are 
the lower. 
B. Cause analysis 
Because of cooperate with disorders among people, 
vehicles, road and environment, road traffic accidents are the 
occasional unexpected event in the road traffic system. Cause 
analysis of traffic accidents are mainly the research on the 
formation of traffic accidents by people, vehicles, roads and 
environmental aspects [1].

Human factors. People are the moving of a traffic safety 
and the main body of traffic safety. In the road traffic system, 
the persons are not only the maker of traffic accidents, but also 
the victims. The persons include all those who use the roads, 
such as drivers, passengers, pedestrians. They are objective 
object in the transportation system. Without comprehensive 
and timely perception, correctly thinking, accurately determine 
and sensitive operation response, it will lead to traffic 
accidents. In this paper we mainly analysis the factors of 
driver's side, and it can be summarized in figure 1. 
 
Figure 1.  Driver factors affecting the traffic safety 
Vehicle factors. Vehicles are the main running tool of 
modern traffic. The quality of technical condition of vehicles is 
a direct factor affecting road safety. The main vehicle factors 
are the motor factor. Poor motor performance, mechanical 
failure or parts damage may be the direct factor causing traffic 
accidents. The main impact factors of autocar safety are 
steering, braking, driving and electric. The influence factors of 
motor vehicles on the road safety are shown in figure 2.

Road factors. The linear, slope, linear combination, road 
surface conditions and the technical level, facilities conditions 
have great impact on traffic safety, and the specific impact 
factors can be list in figure 3.

Environmental factors. The external environment on road 
safety can not be ignored, and we use figure 4 to represent the 
impact of environment on the road traffic safety.

III. THE BASIC THEORY OF DATA MINING 
Data Mining is the process that to extract information and 
knowledge which are potentially useful without known in 
advance from a large number of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy, 
random real data. In short it is to extract or "mining" 
knowledge from the large amounts of data. 
Data mining technology has a powerful data analysis 
capability. According to road traffic accident data, it can find 
the potential accident information or rules through data mining 
method and provide data analysis support for the road safety 
research [5]. 
A. Rough Set Theory 
The fuzzy and uncertainty of rough set theory is based on 
the concept of the border, that is, a collection has fuzzy 
boundaries in particular knowledge [6]. Relative to a particular 
case, each set can be expressed by the exact concept of the 
upper approximation and the lower approximation of that: 
according to the knowledge representation system ),( AUS = , 
design UXAR ?? ? , set and upper approximation )(XR? of 
X, the lower approximation )(XR
?
can be expressed as: 
}:/{)( ???=? XYRUYXR ??       (1) 
}:/{)( XYRUYXR ??=
?
?        (2) 
At the same time, defined )()( XRXposR ?= as X’s 
R-positive domain; )()( XRUXnegR
?
?=  as X’s R-negative 
domain; )()()( XRXRXbnR ?
?
?= as X’s R-boundary region. 
Visually speaking: X’s R-positive domain is a set of 
knowledge R that can be classified to X; X’s R-boundary 
region is the set of the knowledge R that can not determine 
whether classified to X; R-upper approximation is the set of the 
knowledge R that my be classified into X, and it is also the 
merger of positive region and boundary region. 
B. Theory of association rules 
Association rules is an important topic in the field of data 
mining proposed by Rakesh Agrawal and others. Association 
rules reveal the relationship among the data. Association rule 
mining is to analysis the frequency relationship of the data sets 
in the transaction from a given set of data items and 
transactions (each transaction is a data collection of items)[7]. 
Association rule mining can find large amounts of data in an 
interesting correlation between item sets or related links. 
IV. ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF ROAD TRAFFIC 
ACCIDENTS BASED ON DATA MINING 
For the road traffic accidents in specific time and space, 
each accident occurred is not completely independent. We 
should take full account of the relationship of the accident 
between other road traffic accidents in the specific context. 
Firstly analysis the association rules of historical data on road 
traffic accidents appling data mining, and take it as the 
standard mode, recognize the single cause pattern of the 
accident, and finally get their specific causes. 
The forward set of road traffic accidents influence factors 
include road linear, traffic control method, weather conditions, 
etc. And the accident attributes are the latter set including the 
accident level and accident form. By the association mining of 
road traffic accident data, in a certain threshold condition, we 
can obtain in a series of association rules on the cause, like the 
form BAAA i ??"?? 21 , formatting the associated rule sets 
of road traffic accidents causes. For the particular latter set Bq 
of association rules, there exists a generalized association rules 
matrix J, constitute the causes of the comparison matrix, as in 
(3).

with the completion of the causes analysis of the accident. 
V. CASE ANALYSIS 
Extract 100 sets data from traffic accidents database of a 
certain city, and then analysis the road traffic accident data 
using the method in this paper, finally obtained each traffic 
accident causes mode. Via checked by manpower, the 
accuracy rate of the accident cause model extents to 86%, 
which satisfy the demand of traffic safety management. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The study on road traffic accident causes can identify the 
key factors rapidly and efficiently and provide instructional 
methods to the traffic accidents’ prevention and road traffic 
accidents’ reduction, which could greatly reduce personal 
casualty and property loss caused by road traffic accidents. 
Meanwhile, it would be helpful for improving the efficiency 
and security service level of the road transportation system. 
The study of this paper can provide forceful data analysis 
support for the road traffic safety related research.
