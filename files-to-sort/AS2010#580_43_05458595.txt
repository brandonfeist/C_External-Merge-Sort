Abstract—First, the meaning of data mining from EMR with a 
view to discover valuable knowledge, as well as current problems 
is introduced. Then, several possible storage methods for EMR 
are deeply analyzed and studied. On this basis, the solution of 
storage XML EMR with DB2/9.5 hybrid database is presented.   
The XQ-Apriori algorithm based on classic Apriori algorithm 
and XML query language XQuery, as well as an application case 
for association rules mining directly from XML EMR and other 
kinds of XML documents is introduced in detail. It is proved the 
association between diseases can be discovered in effect by using 
this algorithm. Finally, the application circs and the application 
scope of the algorithm are summarized and illuminated?and
further developed research work by author are recommended.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electronic Medical Record (EMR) refer to digital medical 
work records of which medical institutions used to clinical 
treatment and guided intervention for outpatient or inpatient (or 
health care objects), complete and detailed clinical information 
of which individual residents produced and recorded during the 
previous treatments[1].
At present, the hospital medical records are written by 
artificial way in general. A lot of time of doctors has been spent 
on writing them. And a lot of space has been taken up to 
conserve them. Inquiry and reading are difficult, and the 
utilization rate is very low. The long-term conservation value 
of medical records is affected to a certain extent. 
With the push of the informatization process, using 
computers to store and manage medical records and building 
EMR will effectively solve this problem. EMR can also be 
transmitted through the network to better support the long-
distance consultations, to meet the need of information 
exchange and sharing between medical and health agencies. A 
large number of valuable diagnostic and treatment data existed 
in medical records, can not only be used for medical analysis 
and statistics, but also be used to discover many diseases 
associations, development and changes orderliness of diseases, 
unprecedented diseases classification, as well as the 
relationship between diagnosis treatment methods and 
effectiveness. It will strongly support medical research by 
discovering these deep-seated relationships. 
We can see from the contents of EMR as described earlier 
that there are a lot of words, images and other unstructured data 
in EMR, and showed a typical tree structure, so there is a 
certain degree of difficulty using traditional relational database 
to describe and store. However, through analysis and research, 
we found that XML is very suitable to describe EMR, and 
XML database can be used to store EMR. Moreover, 
International Medical Standards Organization HL7 has also 
released clinical document standard (HL7 CDA standard) 
based on XML for the purpose of information exchange. At 
present, the United States, Germany and some other developed 
countries have even established a national or regional EMR 
exchange platform, Chinese Ministry of Health also published 
EMR basic structure and data standards (draft) [1] in August?
2009. The purpose is to regulate the development of EMR 
system in medical institutions, and lay the foundation for the 
construction of regional EMR exchange platform [2]. Thus, the 
research is not only extremely meaningful to carry out data 
mining so as to discover valuable knowledge from EMR with 
XML documents forms, but also a realistic basis. 
II. THE STORAGE OF XML EMR
XML has characteristics of self-description, flexible format, 
and strong expansibility. So, it has become the most 
appropriate description manner of EMR information. We can 
build EMR tree through mapping medical records information 
to different nodes of XML tree. With constant data input, EMR 
tree will gradually grow up. As the data content and format of 
XML is separate, once the format or structure of EMR is 
changed, we can only adjust XML schema to adapt changing 
medical records. 
Currently, XML documents can use four ways of file 
system, relational database, object-oriented database and XML 
database to store [2]:  
 (1) File system take each XML document as a file, before 
accessing each XML document, we must carry through syntax 
parsing, so query and modify is difficult, and the scope of use 
is very limited. 
(2) Using a relational database for XML data access and 
operation, this is the commonly used method, now. However, 
changing the semi-structured data into structured data, there are 
following problems:  
1) XML does not support data types, data types are 
represented by hidden text. The relational data possess rich 
data types, so we need change text-type data to other types 
(data, date, etc.) in mapping procedure, we must judge the text-
type first of all, this is very difficult to achieve in this way. 
2) XML does not require that the tree is balanced, or say 
does not require that sub-tree contains an equal number of

children. If use a relational table to deal with the data contained 
in XML documents, it is likely to be sparse, and a lot of spaces 
do not contain data. There are some difficulties in processing 
the sparse data, in current kinds of available data mining 
algorithms.  
3) Existing data table mapping method can only express 
XML document of simple structure, but not that of database 
mode structures, such as the logical relationship between some 
tables. 
4) XML may contain a number of components that is 
difficult to map, such as processing instructions, entity 
definition and use, property values and the emergence order of 
same type of elements, the content of CDATA and other coded 
information, which is easy to result in the loss of information in 
mapping process. 
 (3) The object-oriented database allows XML elements 
and sub-elements store in cluster, thus improved the query 
efficiency of some applications. However, the object-oriented 
databases are not very mature, are lack of corresponding 
standards, have a narrower scope of application, and have not 
good effect. Thus, to a certain extent, it affected the application 
of XML on it. 
(4) XML database is designed to support the database 
system which store and deal with semi-structured data. Its 
internal memory model is consistent with the inherent 
hierarchical model of XML documents. When access to XML 
documents, it need not to be dismantled/recombine, so it is 
more flexible and efficient. It not only provides traditional 
database technology such as transaction management, security, 
multi-user access, programming API and query language, etc., 
but also supports the latest standards of W3C about XML 
technology, such as support for XQuery/XPath, and so on. 
Compared with traditional databases, XML databases have the 
following characteristics: 
1) XML database can efficiently access and manage semi-
structured data, such as web pages. Traditional relational 
database seems to be powerless to.  
2?XML database can process tag name and path. The 
traditional database language can only access the value of the 
data elements. 
3) XML database can express hierarchical data clearly, and 
can access it easy.  
4) Document-oriented XML database is different from 
traditional data table, its contents are order. So, inquiry, 
connection and modification are more complex. In the 
traditional data table, the order of the items of table is 
interchangeable. 
XML database can be divided into XML Enable Data Base 
(XEDB) and Native XML Database (NXD). XEDB based on 
the traditional database and increased support to XML, to 
realize format conversion and transmission between XML data 
and XEDB. Through appropriate XML API, XML documents 
can be queried and modified, but can’t be stored in XML 
format. From the storage size, entire XML document can be 
taken as a row of RDBMS table. Or, storage a XML document 
to the appropriate table after parsing. Thus, we can see it is 
very inconvenient for XML data processing. The typical 
representatives of such databases are SQL Server/2005 and 
ORACLE/10. 
NXD is specifically designed for storing and managing 
XML documents. It takes XML documents as a database 
storage unit for operations and management. NXD generally 
use the hierarchical data storage model, and maintaining the 
tree structure of XML documents, eliminating the data 
conversion processing between XML documents and 
traditional database. Some typical representatives of such 
databases are commercial Ipedo, X-Hive, Xyleme and Tamino, 
as well as open-source Berkeley DB XML, dbXML, XDB, 
Xindice, and so on. Such kind of databases are generally not 
mature enough, as it is designed for semi-structured data 
storage and processing, so its processing efficiency is very low 
for structured data. As we know that EMR contains both 
unstructured data and structured data, therefore, using such 
kind of databases is still insufficient. 
The DB2/9.5 is a hybrid database which IBM issued, not 
long ago. It can store and process conveniently and efficiently 
both unstructured data and the structured data. It can directly 
retrieve and process the node of XML node tree using XQuery, 
XPath and other XML query language, is very suitable for the 
application of EMR, especially the application of the regional 
exchange platform of EMR [3][4][5]. It is easy to implement 
the data integration and application integration with hospital 
information system (HIS). In view of this, we have chosen and 
used the DB2 V9.5. 
One of the most important features of XML document is 
the separation of content and display output format. EMR 
document of XML itself does not have the format information, 
It implement display and conversion of the contents which is 
described in XML through XSL style sheet language [4][5]. To 
this end, we have defined the template that match with various 
logic components of XML EMR in XSL documents, as well as 
the match conversion mode. It can well describe the way of 
which EMR document of XML convert to any other format of 
document, such as changing to another logical structure of 
XML documents, HTML documents, XHTML documents. 
And that a same style sheet can be used for multiple documents 
with a similar sources tree structure. 
XSL consists of two parts: The first part describes how a 
XML EMR document converts to available browsing and 
output formats; the second part defines the format object FO. 
When output, a source tree is constructed first according XML 
EMR document, and then it is transformed to a result tree 
which can display according to the given XSL. This process is 
called tree transformation. Finally, interpreting the results tree 
according to FO tree, and produce an output results [2].
III. DATA MINING BASED ON XML EMR
Data mining based on XML EMR can use following three 
methods:  
The first method is to embed some query languages 
specifically developed for semi-structured data, such as 
XQuery, XML-QL, XML-GL, etc., into other application 
programs, so as to mine directly from a specific XML EMR. 
The advantage of this approach is that it may combine the 
504
XML technology and data mining technology closely, and 
realize easily and conveniently. 
The second method is to map unstructured data in XML 
EMR to an existing relational model or object model, be 
structured, allowing us use more mature data mining approach 
to mine [6]. But the relationship and the meaning between the 
various parts in XML EMR may be lost in the mapping process. 
The third method is taking XML EMR as a text, thus some 
traditional text mining technologies can be used to mine. Such 
as taking document space as the vector space formed by a 
group of orthogonal term vector by using Vector Space Model 
(VSM). Through statistics of word frequency, shrinking 
dimensions and other steps, make the purposes of machine 
learning and knowledge accessing. However, this method does 
not take into account that XML documents still possess some 
structural features. In addition, large volumes of data and the 
much more data item may lead to feature vector of document 
enormous and cause difficulties in mining.  
Through analysis and comparison, we choose the first 
method.  
As a result of the hybrid database, medical information 
stored in it is standard XML data. In addition, taking into 
account the large number of EMR data entry is mainly through 
the EMR template as assistance which established by schema 
and used for all sections and every disease. Therefore, the 
quality of the data source is very good. The corresponding data 
pre-processing work is relatively simple, so it needn’t do 
further elaboration here. 
Data mining process is the core of knowledge discovery 
based on XML EMR. Traditional data mining techniques are 
mainly for structured data, and can’t deal directly with the 
semi-structured data in XML EMR. Therefore, if we want to 
carry out the data mining for XML EMR, we must combine the 
traditional data mining technology for structured data with the 
technical specifications about XML, design a data mining 
algorithm directly for the XML EMR. 
XQuery is the XML query standards, provides abundant 
and powerful query capabilities, by using it we can convert the 
mining process in traditional association rule mining algorithm 
for structured data into the mining process for XML documents, 
this approach is simple and quick . 
As the knowledge excavated from the XML EMR database 
possesses the format of XML document, it can be directly store 
in a pre-designed table in accordance with the format of the 
schema defined before. Then, the results are displayed in visual 
form and in accordance with the specific XSL format, analyzed 
and evaluated with medical experts.
IV. THE ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM XQ-
APRIORI BASED ON XML EMR
The Apriori algorithm is the most classical algorithm to 
mine association rules for structured data. We introduce the 
XQuery to the Apriori algorithm to improve it and make it 
applicable to XML database which store EMR. The basic idea 
of corresponding XQ-Apriori algorithm is as follows:  
(1)According to needs, extract the corresponding node from 
multiple EMR trees stored in the XML database, generate an 
XML EMR documents to be excavated; 
(2)Mine the association rule from XML EMR documents to 
discover the association between diseases. The mining process 
based on XQuery from XML documents is as follows [7]:  
First step, obtain frequent item sets from the original XML 
document;  
Second step, derive association rules from the frequent item 
sets.
(3)The mining results (found knowledge) are displayed 
through XSL in accordance with the custom of user, for 
evaluation and improvement.  
 For example: If you want to mine association rule from the 
"diagnose results" in XML EMR, first, it is needed to extract 
the diagnose results nodes from corresponding EMR tree of 
each patient, to generate an XML document; then, mine 
association rules from the XML document, and thus obtain the 
association between the diseases; Finally, display the mining 
results as visual form. 
1. The Frequent Item Set Generating Algorithm  
 1) Initializing data. Such as determining the minimum 
support degree $minsup at start, as well as the number of 
patients $total in XML EMR document, etc. 
 2) Scanning the entire XML document through XQuery, 
traversing various nodes in the XML document, reading 
relevant information from the XML document, generating 
candidate item set 1 $C, acquiring support degree of every 
candidate item set 1 at the same time; 
3) Leaving item set 1 which is more than or equal to the 
minimum support degree $minsup, and thus obtaining frequent 
item sets 1 $l;  
4) Processing the obtained information (for example: 
$minsup, $l, etc.) with XQ-Apriori algorithm, and then 
calculating the support degree of item sets by scanning the 
obtained data; 
5) Omitting those item sets that support degree is less than 
the minimum support degree. 
Repeat 2) ~ 5), produce other frequent item sets. 
2. The Association Rules Generating Algorithm  
The idea of which the XQ-Apriori algorithm generates 
association rules is as follows: For each frequent item set X in 
the frequent item sets document, find other frequent item set Y 
in the frequent item sets document, Y to be included in X, and 
the support (X?Y)/support(Y) must be greater than or equal to 
the minimum confidence degree. Supposing the minimum 
support degree is 60%, minimum confidence degree is 70%, 
the algorithm to obtain frequent item sets from the XML 
document is as follows: 
let $src:= document(“/emr.xml”) 
let $minsup := 0.6 
let $total := count($src) * 0.7 
let $C := distinct-values($src/*) 
let $l :=(for $itemset in $C 
let $items := (for $item in $src/* 
where $itemset = $item 
return $item) 
let $sup := (count($items) * 0.7) div $total 
505
where $sup >= $minsup 
return <frequent item sets> 
<items> {$itemset} </items> 
<support degree> {$sup} </support degree> 
</frequent item sets>) 
let $L := $l 
return <all frequent item sets > {Apriori($l, $L,$minsup, $total, $src)} </all 
frequent item sets> 
For ease of illustration, we introduce an EMR document 
based on XML:  
<Diagnosis information of all patients> 
<Patient Information ID ="1"> 
     <Diagnosis information> 
         <Disease ID ="1">Diabetes</Disease> 
         <Disease ID ="2">heart infarction</Disease> 
         <Disease ID ="3">hypertension</Disease> 
         <Disease ID ="4">cataract</Disease> 
     </Diagnosis Information> 
</Patient Information>  
<Patient Information ID ="2"> 
     <Diagnosis information> 
         <Disease ID ="1">cataract</Disease> 
         <Disease ID ="2">heart infarction</Disease> 
      </Diagnosis Information> 
</Patient Information> 
<Patient Information ID ="3"> 
      <Diagnosis information> 
         <Disease ID ="1">Diabetes</Disease> 
         <Disease ID ="2">cataract</Disease> 
         <Disease ID ="3">hypertension</Disease> 
      </Diagnosis Information> 
</Patient Information> 
</Diagnosis information of all patients> 
The final obtained association rules document is as follows:  
<All association rules> 
<Association rule support_degree="0.6" confidence_degree="0.7"> 
<Conditions item> 
           <item>diabetes</item> 
           <item>cataract</item> 
</Condition item> 
<Results item> 
           <item>hypertension</item> 
</Results item> 
</Association rule> 
<Association rule support_degree="0.6" confidence_degree="0.7"> 
<Conditions item> 
           <item>diabetes</item> 
           <item>hypertension</item> 
</Condition item> 
<Results item> 
            <item>cataract</item> 
</Results item> 
</Association rules> 
<Association rule support_degree="0.6" confidence_degree="0.7"> 
<Conditions of entry> 
            <item>cataract</item> 
            <item>hypertension</item> 
</Condition item> 
<Results item> 
            <item>diabetes</item> 
</Results item> 
Because the mining results are also of XML documents, 
they don’t contain display format of knowledge. So it is needed 
to display and output the knowledge obtained from data mining 
in the structure defined by schema, in order to obtain visual 
results.  
V. CONCLUSION
The XQ-Apriori algorithm can not only carry out data 
mining from EMR database based on XML, but also be used in 
a variety of XML documents. By applying the algorithm to the 
EMR based on XML, some very valuable associations between 
diseases have been found, such as diabetes are often associated 
with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiovascular 
disease often accompanied by cardiac autonomic neuropathy, 
there are close relations between gout and liver, kidney, heart, 
etc.. Although these results still need to be confirmed, through 
analysis of the formation mechanism of the disease and a lot of 
medical research, it will obviously provide directions for 
medical research. In addition, as XML has been cross-platform
universal document standard based on content in Internet 
environment, on the one hand, the use of XML documents is 
more and more, on the other hand, the WEB pages information 
using XML are more and more, therefore, designing data 
mining algorithms for XML document is of great practical 
value. 
The follow-up work has two aspects. The first aspect is to 
build the semantic network and to further improve and enhance 
the efficiency of the algorithm and performance; the other 
aspect is to take extensive cooperation with medical research 
workers, select typical cases to conduct a joint research, with a 
view to discover associations between diseases, provide more 
valuable reference for the field of medical research.
