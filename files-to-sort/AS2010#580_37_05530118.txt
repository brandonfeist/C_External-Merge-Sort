1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Different shelf has different promotion effect for retail 
merchandise. High effect shelves which can be defined 
as shelves with fitting height, location etc, can play 
higher promotion effect on demand. Apparently, shelves 
with high effect are important and sparse resource of 
retail stores since a great quantity of products compete 
the limited shelf space for effectively display. It has 
acknowledged that displayed inventory on shelf space 
has an effect on sales for many retail products [1]. 
Mantrala revealed that a good assortment of displayed 
items can increase customers’ perception of shopping 
convenience and improve their loyalty [2]. In particular, 
Wong pointed out that displayed products assortment 
should be adjusted to account for shifting consumer 
profile and lifestyle trend [3]. Larson etc called the 
displayed inventory which is carried to stimulate 
demand ‘psychic stock’ and suggested ‘full-shelf 
merchandising’ policy [4]. Dreze etc made a series of 
field experiments and found that location of the product 
within a display, especially the level of shelf on which 
the product is displayed in case of multi-level shelf, has 
different effect on sales[5]. 
Because sales of displayed inventory can be increased 
by attracting the consumer’s attention and encouraging 
consumers to have additional purchase opportunities, 
product assortment for shelf space has been considered 
as an important decision to retailers. The product 
assortment problem is concerned with the optimum use 
of shelves to provide a complete assortment of products 
meeting the customer’s needs, or say, the problem is to 
determine the variety of products to be displayed on the 
shelves that have the greatest value to customers so as to 
maximize retailer’s profit. 
Due to the space limitation of high effect shelf, retailers 
can only display few products available from suppliers. 
Therefore, high effect shelf is an import resource for 
gaining profit. For making the best of shelf space, 
sometimes, retailers need to abandon some low-profit 
items in high effect shelf and transfer these shelves to 
high-profit items. What items should be discarded is a 
difficult decision problem. The difficulty is that the 
profit of one item not only comes from its own sales, 
but also from its influence on the sales of other items, 
i.e., the "cross demand effect". Another challenge to the 
product assortment problem is that customer’s demands 
are ever-changing. The demand intensity for product 
would change with time. This dynamic nature of 
demand makes both the direct profit and indirect profit 
from cross demand effect of a product change with time. 
Thus, the product assortment should be dynamically 
changed with time so as to make the shelf allocation 
respond the changing demand in dynamic market. 
The increase of electronic data gathering devices, such 
as point-of-sale technologies, has made it easier for 
retailers to collect data, and some knowledge about 
customer behavior can be learned from these data. 
Furthermore, the retailer can roughly estimate 
customer’s demand before the sale begins through 
analyzing historical data and fine-tune this estimation 
by using real time sales data. Through estimating 
customers’ demand intensity for various products and 
analyzing their purchasing pattern, retailer can observe a 
product assortment’s marketing effect in a simulated 
setting for intending sale horizon. In this paper, a 
transaction simulation approach is presented, and a 
dynamic product assortment algorithm is developed 
through analyzing simulated transaction data. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
related researches are reviewed in next part of this 
section. Section 2 gives the problem definition. The 
transaction simulation approach is depicted in Section 3. 
Section 4 describes how to estimate direct and indirect 
profit with simulated data. Then, in Section 5, a genetic 
algorithm for dynamic product assortment is introduced. 
Experiments results are addressed in section 6. This 
paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 7. 
 
1.1 Related researches 
 
Product assortment problem of high effect shelf 
management can be defined as the process to select 
products in business for display in high effect shelf 
978-1-4244-6487-6/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE
 space. The measurement of demand effects which has 
been widely used to estimate the relationship between 
sales and allocated space, is the main challenge for this 
problem. Demand effects can be divided into two types: 
direct demand effect and cross-demand effect. Direct 
demand effect is used to measure the effect on demand 
by changing the display space for product, and the 
cross-demand effect of a target product is measured to 
estimate the effect on demand of other products by 
changing the display space for this product. 
Anderson and Amato formulated the product assortment 
optimization model as a knapsack problem, in which 
only the direct demand effect was considered [6]. 
Hansen and Heinsbroek also estimated the direct 
demand effects in their mathematical programming [7]. 
Corstjens and Doyle developed a generalized geometric 
programming model with both the direct effects and 
cross effects of demand [8]. Zufryden presented 
dynamic programming approach to solve the model of 
Corstjens and Doyle, in which the integer solutions can 
be provided through allowing the consideration of 
general objective function requirements [9]. Cross 
demand effect was considered in Borin’s optimization 
model, and simulated annealing algorithm was 
suggested as a solution methodology [10]. Urban 
integrated the inventory control model with the product 
assortment model [11]. A type of multi-constraint 
knapsack model for the shelf space allocation, 
developed by Yang, take display space and shelf 
location into consideration [12]. Hark presented a 
genetic algorithm to optimize shelf space design and 
item allocation [13]. 
However, high cost of experiment is needed to measure 
direct demand effect and cross demand effect in 
above-mentioned model. To overcome this drawback, 
some data mining-based approaches were proposed. 
Brijs proposed a model celled PROFSET to solve the 
product assortment problem in convenience stores, in 
which cross demand effect can be measured by 
association rules [14]. Wang draw an analogy between 
this cross demand effect and the mutual reinforcement 
of hub/authority web pages and applies the 
“hub-authority” profit ranking approach to solve the 
maximal profit item-selection problem [15]. Wong 
proposed a novel approach with consideration of the 
loss rule—a rule similar to the association rule—to 
model the cross demand effect [16]. 
 
2. PROBLEM DEFINITION 
 
Given a items set I with n different items, I1, I2, …, In, 
let I={I1, I2, ……, In}. We supposed that only m items 
can be displayed in high effect shelf space for a selling 
horizon. Before the sale begins, the seller conducts 
market researches such as market surveys or historical 
data analysis, to forecast the customer arrival number N 
and each product’s sale quantity iQ . The decision 
horizon can be separated into T discrete epochs to make 
each epoch short enough that within each epoch there is 
almost one customer arrival. Thus, the arrival rate of 
each epoch can be calculated by: 
T
N
=? . The 
probability that an arrival customer would purchase the 
i-th product is: 
T
Qi
i =? . Let vector ?=(?1, ?2…?n) 
denote the estimated purchasing probabilities for all 
items in set I. 
We refer to the profit of an item coming from its own 
sales as direct profit, the profit coming from "cross 
demand effect" as indirect profit. As defined by Brijs 
etc [14, 15, 16], the cross demand effect can be 
measured by association rules. 
Because customers’ purchasing patterns are relatively 
steady, an item’s direct profit and indirect profit mainly 
rest with demand intensity parameters:? and ?. We 
supposed that m different items should be selected for 
high effect shelf space. Let ID ?  be the set of 
selected items, and DIV ?=  be the set of reserved 
items. Let ),(, ??DDR  be the direct profit of D when 
demand parameters are ? and ?. Let ),(, ??VDR  
denote indirect profit of D due to cross demand effects 
on V. Then the total profit of D is given by: 
),(),(),( ,, ?????? VDDDD RRR +=       (1) 
Suppose that retailer determines to select m different 
items from set I for the sake of making the best of high 
effect shelf space. The problem researched in this paper 
is how to partition set I into two subsets D and V. The 
goal of partition is that profit from set D should be as 
high as possible. 
 
3. TRANSACTION SIMULATION 
 
Let X={x1, x2,…xk} denote an items set, where xi?I. let 
U denote a transaction set, card(U) denote the number 
of transactions in U, and card(X) denote the number of 
all the transactions that contain items set X, 
s(X)=
)(
)(
Ucard
Xcard  denote the frequent occurrence degree 
of items set X. A frequent items set can be defined as 
follow: if there exist an items set X, and s(X)>?, then 
items set X is a frequent items set. Here ?(0<?<1) is a 
threshold value. Let x (x ?I) be an item in business, 
apparently, s(x)=
)(
)(
Ucard
xcard  is the frequent degree of 
item x. If s(x) >?, we call x frequent item. 
Assumption 1: High effect Shelf space should display 
items that are sufficient to attract customer. The 
frequent degree s(x) just reflects how much customers 
are interested by the item x. Thus only frequent item can 
be candidate for displaying in high effect shelf space. 
According to assumption 1, we just need to simulate the 
transaction containing frequent item. 
Definition 1: if X is a frequent items set and card(X)=k, 
then X is called k-frequent items set and denoted by 
kX . If frequent item sets kX  and ikX +  satisfy: 
 kX ? ikX + , then ikX +  can be called super frequent 
item set of kX . 
Apparently, any item x in frequent item set kX  is also a 
frequent item, and the set {x} can be called 1-frequent 
item set. 
Definition 2: if a transaction contains frequent item set 
kX , but not contains any super frequent item set of 
kX , then we call this transaction according with the 
purchasing pattern. kXˆ . The kXˆ  is called k-pattern. 
Let set ?  denote the set of all the super frequent item 
set of kX . The number of all the transactions that 
accord with kXˆ  can be calculated as follow: 

??
+

?=
1X
1)X()X()Xˆ(
k
kkk cardcardcard      (2) 
Let an item xi?Xk. If a transaction contains item xi, then 
the conditional probability that this transaction accords 
with pattern Xk can be calculated as follow: 
)(
)Xˆ()XˆPr(
i
k
i
k
xcard
cardx =             (3) 
According to the generalized total probability formula, 
the probability that an arrival customer’s transaction 
pattern accords to kXˆ can be calculated by: 

?
×=
k
i Xx
i
k

k x )XˆPr()XˆPr( ?        (4) 
Assumption 2: Purchasing patterns corresponding to 
customer behavior can be discovered in the transaction 
data set, and these patterns will remain unchanged in 
relatively short time horizon. 
Assumption 3: A customer buys only one unit of a 
certain product in same transaction. 
Frequent item set can be discovered in historical 
transaction data set, and according to assumption 2, its’ 
frequent degree s(X) will remains steady. 
Let t (t=1,2…T) denote the index of epoch in a decision 
horizon. Suppose that parameters ? and ? are known, a 
Monte Carlo-based transaction simulation algorithm is 
design as follow: 
Monte Carlo-based Transaction Simulation 
Find out all frequent item set and frequent degree s(X) 
Let t=1 
Do while t?T  
 Simulate customer’s arrival by probability ?  
 If there happen a customer arrival event then 
  Work out occurrence probability of each pattern kXˆ  
  Simulate purchase event by )XˆPr( k  
End if 
 t=t+1 
End do 
 
4. PROFIT ESTIMATION 
 
Let TU  denote simulated transaction set within 
decision horizon T, iu  be the i-th transaction in TU . 
Let A={A1, A2,… Am} denote the set of association 
rules discovered from TU . The j-th rule Aj can be 
denoted by: Xi Yi (si%) (ci%), where si% denotes  
the support degree of this rule, and ci% denotes the 
confidence degree. Let D be a decision, then V= I-D. 
Definition 3: if rule Aj satisfies: ( Dui ? )? jX  and 
( Vui ? )? jY , then we call rule Aj includes iu , 
denoted by iu ? Aj. 
Supposed there exist:  (1) iu ? Aj. and (2) an item 
y? jY . Let yr  denote marginal profit of item y, 
)(, iyD uR  denote the indirect profit gained from iu  
because jX  (D? jX ) owns cross demand effect on y. 
Then the cross demand effect )(, iyD uR  can be 
calculated by: 
%)(, jyiyD cruR ×=             (5) 
A transaction iu  may accord to several rules. Let 
y
ui
A ={ AAyYAAA jjujj i ??? ,, }. According to the 
definition of association rule, support degree reflects the 
importance level of rule. Each rule’s importance weight 
in set yuiA  can be calculated by:

5. GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR ITEMS 
SELECTION 
  
Wong has proved that the maximal-profit item selection 
problem researched in this paper is NP-hard. Thus a 
genetic algorithm is used for this problem. The genetic 
algorithm can be viewed as an optimization method 
which encodes a possible solution of a problem in a 
chromosome-like data structure. This approach creates a 
number of chromosomes in a population and finds a 
solution by rearranging the chromosomes in the 
population. Some key steps of this approach are 
described as follow. 
 
5.1 Encoding 
 
For the encoding, we take a string of 0's and 1's which is 
called a chromosome. First, set index for each item in 
set I, and the bit position of a chromosome string is the 
index of each item. If the value of a bit is 1, it means 
that the corresponding item is selected in set D. If the 
value of a bit is 0, the item is selected into set V. e.g. if 
the coding of a certain chromosome is 001100…, this 
encoding means that item #3 and #4 are selected into D 
and item #1, #2, #5, #6 are selected into V. 
 
5.2 Fitness function 
 
When items in set D are selected to be displayed in shelf 
space, the total profit of set D, ),( ??DR , can be 
estimated by above-mentioned estimation algorithm 
which is based on transaction simulation. 
 
5.3 Initial solution population 
 
Let Tr xx ×× ?  be the direct profit estimation of the 
item x. For forming initial chromosome, we just rank 
items by their direct profit estimation from high to low 
and set different selected probability accordingly for 
them: setting higher selected probability for the item 
with higher profit, setting lower selecting probability for 
the item with lower profit. We select the items 
stochastically according to their selected probability. If 
an item is selected, its’ bit value in a chromosome is 
marked as “1”, otherwise, marked as “0”. When we 
have selected m items, one chromosome is formed. 
After a chromosome is formed, we can repeat this step 
from the beginning until k initial chromosomes are 
formed. 
 
5.4 Crossover and Mutation 
 
1. The genetic algorithm firstly randomly selects pairs 
of individual chromosomes for reproducing next 
generation. The probability of a chromosome being 
selected is proportional to its fitness function value. 
2. Comparing the bit value of parent chromosomes, and 
entail the bit with same position value to offspring 
chromosomes. Now there are still some bits without 
value in the offspring chromosomes, this means that 
these bits have not inherited value from parent 
chromosomes. In order to ensure that there are just m 
bits with value 1 in offspring chromosomes, crossover 
operator should continue steps as follow: 
a) Working out the number of bits with value 1 on the 
offspring chromosome. Suppose there are r bits 
with value “1”, then there will be m-r bits to get 
value 1 in those bits without value. 
b) Getting out all the bit position index of bits 
without value. According to these position indexes, 
scan all the bit values at the same position in 
parent chromosomes. If there is a bit with value 1 
at the same position in either of the parent 
chromosomes, then set the bit in offspring 
chromosome with value 1 . 
c) Repeat b) until the number of bits with value 1 
becomes m. Set value 0 for other empty bits. 
3. After crossover procedure, we get some offspring 
chromosomes from previous generation chromosomes. 
Then Select one chromosome from the offspring 
chromosomes with a low probability (for example the 
probability 0.5%) to run mutation process. In order to 
ensure that there are just m bits with value 1 in a 
chromosome after mutation, we do the following 
mutation operation to the chromosome: 
a) Select one bit from bits with value 0 stochastically, 
and change the value to 1. 
b) Select one bit from bits with value 1 stochastically, 
and change the value to 0. 
 
6. EXPETIMENT 
 
From the observation on transaction records in a certain 
convenience store in Shanghai, we obtained a set 
transaction sample of 300 kinds of items in fifteen days. 
The quantity of shelves with high effect is relatively 
small. Having calculated the probability distribution of 
each item or items combination purchased from sample 
data, we work out 70 frequent item set. Then we 
designed a simulation program to produce transaction 
data during a period of time.

The results of the experiments are shown in table 1. In 
the table 1, the figure m denotes the number of items 
selected to be displayed in high effect shelf. we measure 
the total profit (direct and indirect profit) of m selected 
items, and the profitability is the percentage of the total 
profit in all the simulated data set. Table 1 demonstrates 
the comparison of profit effect by two items selection 
methods when m varies. The average profitability of 
genetic algorithm is 48% higher than direct profit 
ranking method. 
 
 7. CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper, we explored how to optimize product 
assortment of high effect shelf. A simulation-based 
genetic algorithm is developed which can find optimal 
solution according the demand parameters. The 
simulation module makes the fitness function value of 
genetic algorithm keep consistent with the future 
demand state. Thus, the genetic algorithm can adjust 
product assortment if the demand state change at any 
time. The experiment result shows that approach 
presented in this paper can make full use of high effect 
shelf space of a retail store.
