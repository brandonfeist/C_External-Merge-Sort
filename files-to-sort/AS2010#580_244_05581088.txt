Abstract:
The transmission of massive highly related data could
generally exist in gathering scenario of sensor networks and lead
to the depletion of valuable energy resource. According to the
above energy waste problem, an effective filtering mechanism is
proposed in the paper to enhance the energy-efficiency of
data-gathering. Many current researches adopt clustering
method and aggregation technology to lower energy cost during
the process in data transmission, while our proposed filtering
framework mainly puts emphasis on inhibiting the production
of redundant loads at the gathering source to greatly reduce
energy cost using self-adaptive filtering scheme, which is
constructed by prediction module for mining the time domain
association, self-learning module for modifying model and
driving module for executing filtering operation. We can prove
the above filter components combined with the running of
error-driving rule and threshold-distributing rule can effectively
decrease the quantity of data transmission in networks based on
QoS requirement. Finally, the simulation results show that the
proposed filtering mechanism can do better than some classical
data gathering approaches on the aspect of energy-saving effect.

1. Introduction
The traditional architecture in sensor networks consists
of a large number of sensor nodes deployed over an area of
interest to sample data, process them locally and send the
results to a data collection point, i.e., BS. Data gathering[1-2]
is a critical operation in sensor networks for extracting useful
information from the operating environment. Energy-efficient
in data gathering of sensor networks has been long studied in
many articles. In [3], the authors tried to compute a minimum
spanning tree over the sensor network to minimize the total
energy expended in a round of communication. Modulation
scaling[4] is integrated into the weighted fair queuing
scheduling policy and the problem of balancing the energy
dissipation along a multi-hop communication path is studied.
Data aggregation techniques[5-9]can be introduced into
cluster-based approaches in sensor networks, which is
defined as the process of aggregating the data from multiple
sensors to eliminate redundant transmission and
corresponding works focus on the design of efficient
algorithms to construct routing trees in aggregation way. The
authors of [10] present an ant colony based method to solve
the problem of constructing an aggregation tree for a group of
source nodes within the sensor networks. However, the
construction of the appropriate tree depends heavily on the
nodes’ deployment and depletes an important amount of
power. Paper [11] proposes an adaptive data aggregation
scheme for clustered sensor networks, where the temporal
and spatial aggregation degrees are determined by the current
scheme state according to the observed reliability. But the
scheme neglected the importance of scalability of such kind
of networks. The central work of [12] adopts the Mobile
Agents (MAs) technologies for an energy-efficiency data
gathering. However, the size of the mobile agent message is
large enough to waste an important part of this reduced power,
when sending it on the sensor networks.
The above researches emphasize on the idea that the
underlying structure of the network can be abstracted as a
data aggregation tree, which aggregates and collects
information from multiple sources route to the sink. And
presented solutions mainly achieve the energy-saving effect
during the process of data transmission. Different from the
mentioned methods, in this paper, predictive mechanism on
time series model is adopted to reveal the variation law in
time dimension and mine the implication of time-redundancy.
The addressed schemes in the paper mainly focus on reducing
the temporal redundant degree in event-source to achieve the
energy-saving effect. That is to say, redundant-data filtering
operations which run at the source of data-gathering structure
can be performed before the course of data transmission.
Paper Organization: the background of related works is
discussed in Section 1. The system model of prediction-based
filter structure in data-gathering mechanism is presented in
Section 2. In Section 3, Prediction-Mode-Filtering algorithm
(PMF) for the energy-saving problem in sensor networks is

described in details. Simulation results are shown in Section
4. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 5.
2. System model
Sensor networks can be regarded as an undirected weighted
connectivity-graph G(N,E,C) , where N and E respectively
represent the set of nodes and links inG , whileC denotes the set
of corresponding cost in E . At the beginning stage of basic
data-gathering, base station (BS) firstly initiates the query
request. The major task in the stage is the construction and
modification of predictive model based on the study on
historic information. After the above initialization, cluster
head (CH) receives the sampling sequence from cluster’s
members in the hierarchical clustering structure, realizes the
parameter estimation of time-series predictive model, then
returns the results to members. Finally, each member
respectively sets up the identical model replica on itself. The
above serial operations could be modeled as the following steps :
CH collects the sampling sequence 1{ }i
t
ix = from icluster at
the interval t? , which is used as training-data enters into
queue ? to build model. CH estimates the stability
characteristic of { }
i
x according to the parameter rule[13-14]
and executes the smooth pre-processing. Then, CH selects the
obeyed order to modify the model parameters by calculating
the partial autocorrelation function. The green function and
the l -step predictive equation ARMA [15] can be obtained as
follows:

From the modification of prediction equation shown in
equation3we can see that the l m+ step prediction
variance is decreased by
2 2
l l
G ? compared with the original
variance. That means, to modify the predictive value using
the new sampling series needn’t repeated calculation and the
algorithm complexity is accordingly reduced.
3. The design of Prediction-based filter structure in
data-gathering mechanism
In the self-adapting data filtering stage, the same
bidirectional predictive model is introduced into both CH and
members. The core in energy-saving mechanism is the
self-adapting filtering framework (as seen in Figure 1), which
is mainly composed of predictive module (PM), self-learning
module (LM), trigger module (TM), threshold allocation
rule 1? and error driving rule 1? . The execution step of
filtering framework is as follows. Firstly, predictive module
constructs the ( , )ARMA p q based on input series to execute
predictive function, subject to rule 1? . Then the deviation
value from the threshold and error range acts as the input
signal of trigger module to generate results, which can drive
the corresponding node’s operation.
The design and operation of each component in this
filtering system is shown in Figure 1, whose structure is
based on our approach.

The precision threshold allocation rule 1? can indirectly
control the transmission performed by
i k
n cluster? ? ?G. And
the precision threshold
th
err could be constant value or
adjustable one, whose energy-saving effects are discussed as
follows:
Formula (4) is mathematical programming(MP) of
filtering-mechanism with constant precision threshold,
where ( )
i
Num packet means the quantity of data
transmission in cluster and the objective function denotes the
goal to minimize the amount of transmission packets in
cluster, which is subject to constraint condition of data
consistency.

In the filtering-mechanism with constant precision, each
member in cluster is allocated with the same precision range
and the transmission operation is triggered only when the
prediction-error exceeds therr , so the range of precision
threshold is in inverse proportion to energy cost. The above
analysis enlightens a way to further reduce the energy
consumption by distributing the personalized precision range
to
i k
n cluster? ? according to its own energy status (as seen
in formula5). Therefore, adjusting precision range can be
exploited to reduce the total energy cost in cluster. In the
application of environment monitoring in sensor networks,
extracting the mean value of sampling data is usually treated
as the data fusion mode, so the cluster as a whole can be
regarded as an abstracted node and QoS is satisfied under the
premise.

The concrete operating process based on error range is
illustrated as follows
If the requirement of predictive precision is met,
i.e., [0, )i therr err? , members needn’t send sampling series
to CH, which embodies the design idea that the energy-saving
effect is improved by reducing the temporal-redundancy
information in sensor networks on the premise of QoS, which
can be abstracted as threshold th? of filter.
When [ , )i th therr err ?? , TM triggers the operations of LM

thcnt cnt? should indicate that the monitored events occur,
so data transmission is started up. The above QoS-oriented
predictive mechanism, in essence, reflects the data-filtering
operation via reducing the transmitted data amount to
decrease energy consumption. In the practical application of
data-gathering, the abnormal values obtained by sensors can
be caused by various reasons. Sometimes, it doesn’t mean
that the predictive model missmatches the distribution of
environment data. Therefore, it is unreasonable that the
transmission should be triggered only by single-time
abnormity and threshold of abnormity cumulative times is set
as thcnt to reduce the probability of maloperation, the
transmission can be executed only when thcnt cnt? .

CH and its members own the duplicate copy of
predictive model. If CH doesn’t receive the next frame
sampling-series during the predetermined blocking time,
which means the precision requirement is met. Then the data
reconstruction is implemented by CH to substitute the
calculated predictive results for the actual sampling series on
the premise of meeting QoS. As a result, the frequency of
transmission is greatly reduced. To prevent the misjudgment
caused by the death of nodes,
i k
n cluster? ? periodically
broadcasts beacon to CH to show that it is alive. If CH
doesn’t receive beacon during time interval tht , node in is
considered dead. The same bidirectional predictive model is
introduced into both BS and CH. BS makes judgment that

If BS doesn’t receive any information from specific CH

be substituted by the calculated predictive values; otherwise,
BS decodes codes sent by CHs for data-reconstruction. The
energy-saving essence of proposed scheme is adopting the
prediction calculation to substitute the actual transmission
operation for greatly reducing the amount of communication
loads in networks. Based on the above designs, intra-cluster
communication mode using prediction mechanism in
data-gathering is shown in Figure 2.

4. Simulation and results
The goal of filtering mechanism in sensor networks is to
achieve the energy-saving effect by reducing the redundant
communication loads in networks, which is the trade off
between the predication-precision and energy-efficiency. In
the simulator platform ns2, sensor networks can be randomly
formed in the 150m×150m planar topology with adjustable
density.BS is located in (0,0). The monitored data-gathering
is used in application scenarios of environmental thematic
monitoring and events occur in area with diagonal
coordinate[(120,90), (150,60)]). It is assumed that the
occurrence of events obey the Poisson distribution with the
limited duration time and tunable event radius. Given the
range of QoS-oriented predictive error, the simulation results
are obtained from 500 rounds test and set the size of data
packet as 100 bytes. Then 3000 continuous observation
samplings are randomly chosen with the sampling interval as
8min and the sampling series contain trend component,
periodic component, and the stable component Querying

Figure 3 shows that when introducing the predictive
mode filter into data-gathering mechanism, the energy cost is
gradually decreased with the increase of the prediction
precision. Compared with the other algorithms[16-17], the
energy consumption of PMF is the least and the reason is
caused by reasonable error-range introduced into PMF on the
basis of bidirectional prediction mode, on which the identical
predictive model is run on BS and CH at the same time.

Figure 3. Energy consumption among various prediction
methods
The relation between error-threshold and transmission
rate contrasted in different network sizes
( 11.2 *i iN N += , 1 172, 1, , 3N i= =  )is shown in Figure 4,
where the transmission rate is defined as the ratio of sent-data
amount to the total sampling series amount. From the
simulation results, we can see that the transmission rate is
gradually decreased with the increase of error-threshold,
which leads to the transmission cost being greatly reduced.
When the error-threshold is increased to the specific value,
i.e., 45%therr ? , the change on network size will make little
contribution to decrease energy consumption, that is to say,
the network’s scale effect is weaken. The reason is that
enlarging the allowable error range will inhibit the
transmission operation executed by most nodes.

map to the abnormal sampling data, obey the Poisson
distribution with parameter? . As shown in Figure 5, on the

the inhibition effect on the transmission times can be
gradually enhanced and the corresponding energy cost could
be effectively reduced. While, on the general inquiry mode,
the average transfer times of packets have proportional

could be improved by introducing the predictive mode into
data-gathering filtering mechanism of sensor networks.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, the feature of temporal correlation on
time series data is utilized to design novel energy-efficient
filtering mechanism in data gathering of sensor networks,
subject to QoS constraints. By diminishing the temporal
redundancy on time series, prediction-mode-based filtering
mechanism is designed to solve the problem of energy waste
caused by the transmission of time-redundant loads. The
operation processes of filtering mechanism can construct and
modify the predictive model via self-learning on sampling
series to accurately capture the changing law of time domain,
meanwhile, allocation rule on prediction accuracy threshold
and prediction-error-driven rule are introduced into the
design of filtering scheme, where tunable prediction
threshold is determined based on node energy status and
internal information which is included in the data variation
patterns precisely obtained according to prediction error
bound. The above design idea is to further improve the
filtering effect on time redundancy data. The experiment
results show that the proposed energy-saving filtering
mechanism can effectively reduce the energy cost of data
gathering mechanism by mining the temporal redundancy and
associability.
