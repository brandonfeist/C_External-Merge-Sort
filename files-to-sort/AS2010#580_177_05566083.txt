Abstract—E-commerce commodities contain a large number of 
associated information, an algorithm on how to mine   
association rules based on rough set is proposed in this paper. 
The different feature vectors extracted from different types of 
commodities can be looked as a prerequisite for getting 
association rules. By using the knowledge reduction theory the 
associated commodities can be drown as a minimum set of 
commodities and we can get the association rules from the set. 
We have designed a more efficient algorithm for mining 
association rules and the algorithm is also described in detail by 
example.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The use of association rules to carry out excavation on web 
commodities information in electronic commerce can find the 
user's buying patterns, access mode and visit frequency[1]. 
Association rules is a trade statistics database in which we can 
obtain the purchase relation of the commodity A and B and 
more. The use of mining association rules is to discover this 
pattern, which can tell merchant how to recommend users 
some higher correlation commodities, and it can increase 
sales[2].  
Rough set is a new mathematical tool to deal with 
incomplete and uncertain knowledge, which main feature is 
that would not require certain characteristics or properties in 
advance. From the given classification knowledge we can 
obtain the knowledge reduction and deduce association rules 
by its indiscernibility relation and classification[3]. 
II.  ALGORITHM ANALYSIS 
It is used the positive domain, negative domain and the 
domain boundaries to describe the definition extent in rough 
set. The given problem domain will be divided and determined 
their support level to certain concept. It includes three support 
levels: certain support, not support and possible support. In 
commodities association rules mining, the commodity is 
defined as property and commodities characteristic is defined 
as domain elements.  
A set of commodities M = (U, T), U is the feature set of 
non-empty and finite. T is non-empty set of commodities. 
Suppose Va is the value of a and a ?T, U?Va is a single 
map, so any one element of U in the properties of Va is an 
unique value. If the T include condition attribute set C and 
decision attribute set D, and C ? D = T, C ? D = ?, that the 
system S is associated with commodities. While inspecting the 
association rules, you can choose key objectives of 
commodities as decision attributes, analyze other commodities 
dependence to the target commodities, on this basis, the 
rational proportion of commodities can be distributed[4].  
 In a set of commodities M = (U, C ? D), the correlation 
and interest-degree of certain commodities in C are not high, 
on the conditions of maintaining the same association rules of 
key commodities, you can delete these redundant 
commodities. Through the commodities reduction can get 
minimal and correct association rules. If ind  (B) = ind 
(B-{a}), B  C, a ?  C, then B is redundant. A set of 
commodities may exist many reductions, the intersection of 
these reductions is defined as the core of high relativity and 
concerns[5].  
III.  ALGORITHM REALIZATION 
Algorithm realization is shown as follows:  
(1) The collection of commodities must be divided into 
commodity set to be associated and target commodity set.  
(2) By the use of discernibility matrix and discernibility 
function can obtain reduction set of commodities.  
Discernibility matrix:M (T) = (m (i, j) | n × n, 1 ? i, j ? n), 
m (i, j) = (a ? T | a (i) ? a (j) and d (i) ? d (j)), n = | U |[6].  
Discernibility function as follows:  
  
 
? on behalf of "?", ? on behalf of "?".  
 (3) Association rules can be derived by the reduction set of 
commodities. We can get the attribute reduction set and core 
from the minimal disjunctive of the discernibility function, and 
the resulting association rules can be deduced.  
(4) To retain the rules which certainty factor is 1.

For rule r ij: des (X i) ? des (Y j), Y j ? X i ? ?,  
Certainty factor is:  ? (X i, Y j) = | Y j ? X i | / | X i |, 0 <? 
(X i, Y j) ? 1.  
?5?Correlation analysis.  
In the rule C1 ? C2 ? C3 ? ... ? Cn => D1 ? D2 ? 
D3 ? ... ? Dm, the correlation formula is shown as follows:  
corr (C1 ? C2 ? ... ? Cn), (D1 ? D2 ? ... ? Dm) =  
 
 
If corr <1, then the antecedent and consequent are 
negatively correlated.  
If corr> 1, then the antecedent and consequent are 
positively correlated.  
If corr = 1, then the antecedent and consequent are 
independent of each other.  
The association rules can be deleted or retained according 
to the corr values. For the negative correlation rules, the 
antecedent and consequent are mutually inverse, and should be 
deleted. For corr = 1 rules, antecedent and consequent are 
independent of each other, such rules are also uninteresting. As 
for the positive correlation rules, the antecedent contains 
emergence of the consequent, such rules are the higher interest 
rules.  
IV.  EXAMPLE ANALYSIS  
We use a two-dimensional table shown in table 1 to 
describe the commodities set. Domain U is characteristic value 
of commodities and described as rows. Column property is 
described as commodities set and target commodity is M 5. 
The discernibility matrix is shown in Table 2.  
The discernibility matrix can be derived as table 2 
according to table 1 .  
The discernibility function shown as follows can be 
derived from table 2.

According to the value of ?, commodities reduction set can 
be deduced as {M2, M3, M4} and the core is also {M2, M3, 
M4}. The commodities association rules shown in table 3 can 
be derived from the core and target commodities.

V.  CONCLUSION  
The commodities information is not complete and certain 
in web data. The association rules mining techniques based on 
rough set can deal with such information efficiently. Through 
data classification and reduction, and restricted by correlation 
value ? and corr, we can get a higher accuracy commodity 
association rules set. Under the conditions of strict equivalence 
relation and professional commodities, rough set algorithm on 
mining commodities association rules may result in omissions 
and bias. The algorithm can be combined with other mining 
algorithms and professional commodities knowledge to 
eliminate noise data interference, further enhance the accuracy 
and robustness of the algorithm on commodities association 
rule mining.
