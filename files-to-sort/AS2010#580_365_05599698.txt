Abstract 
This article presents a novel researched method for 
investigating the cognitive processes of children. This 
study designed an activity to observe characteristics of 
cognitive process. In the activity, children were asked to 
engage in thinking and using scientific concept to draw 
as many as possible optical paths between the laser gun 
and target. There were 95 fifth graders participate in 
this study. Association rules mining were 1used as a 
research method for exploring relationships between 
different types of optical path in this experiment. The 
data mining results demonstrated that it consist with 
Piaget’s cognitive development theory, showing that 
concrete operation is the dominant thinking mode for 
fifth grader. It is concluded that data mining is an 
appropriate research method for analyzing the cognitive 
processes when it is cooperated with research 
techniques in thinking skills, such as creativity or 
problem-solving.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Association rule mining is a popular and a well 
developed research method for business management. It 
is used to discover interesting relations between 
variables in large databases. Agrawal et al. [1] had 
introduced the basic concepts of associated rule mining. 
For example, a customer buys bread; he/she is likely to 
also buy jam. This information can be used to predict 
behavior pattern and model of consumers. Though this 
method was first used in business, the application of this 
method is getting more popular in other research fields. 
In the educational field, this method have been used to 
find conceptual map models [3] and learning portfolio 
analysis [4] but seldom used in cognitive process 
analysis. This article presents a new researched method 
for investigating the cognitive processes of children 
during creatively solving problem.

2. METHODOLOGY 
In this section, subjects, instrument and data 
collection, data analyzed were introduced as followings.
2.1 Subjects 
There were 95 fifth graders from four intact classes 
participated in this study. These students were from a 
school in Tuo-Yuan County, Taiwan. Students in this 
school were composed of diverse socio-economic 
statuses and could be regarded as a typical school in 
Taiwan. 
2.2 Instrument and Data Collection  
We designed an experiment to explore the 
characteristic of cognitive process of human, in this case, 
naïve student. The theoretical background of this design 
was following the research founding in creativity 
research. Studies in this research area has been identified 
that the fluency and unique were important to one’s 
creativity [2]. This study developed a fluency test 
activity to induce students’ cognitive thinking structure. 
In the experiment, students were invited to actively 
engage in thinking and using basic scientific concept to 
draw as many paths as possible of using a laser beam to 
shoot the target as indicated in Figure 1. An additional 
requirement to the test was that student needed to use 
the minimum of mirrors to reach the target. This 
modification from traditional creativity test allowed 
students to show his/her fluency, in addition, some 
unique thinking. This also provided information for us to 
observe students’ cognitive operation process.

students for they to draw as many paths as 
possible

Students were given enough time to make drawing in 
classes. After the test, students’ diagrams were collected, 
translated and coded for later analyzing.
2.3 Data Analysis 
Students’ drawings were coded and analyzed with 
association rules mining method [1]. 
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION  
Analyses of students’ draws were showed in Table 1. 
The percentage of each optical path that students have 
drawn was showed in the last column. From this table, it 
was interesting to find that students’ cognitive 
operations in this experiment were systematic. Two 
factors were found here: the first, “forced adapting” vs. 
“planned adapting”; the second, “short path” vs. “long 
path”.  
The s6 path was a typical example of “forced 
adapting.” Student added mirrors only when the beam 
was about to touch the wall or black brick. This revealed 
the student put mirror to reflect the beam when he/she 
was forced. Differently, the s1 showed a typical example 
of “planned adapting.” Student “planned” the position of 
mirrors and put mirror, but not “forced” by the wall or 
brick and no choice to do so. Student who drew s1 was 
considered to be more “abstract thinking.” And, student 
drew s6 was considered to be more “concrete thinking.”  
From Table 1, percentages of more abstract-oriented 
optical path s1, s3, and s5, (22, 15 and 20%, respectably) 
were lower than that of other more concrete-oriented 
optical paths (s2, s4, and s6; 87, 62, and 86% 
respectably). This revealed that students in the fifth 
grade were comparably limited in using 
abstract-oriented thinking then concrete-oriented 
thinking. Such result matches with Piaget’s cognitive 
development theory [5]. 
The seven optical paths have different length: short 
(s1, s2), medium (s3, s4), long (s5, s6) and shortest (s7). 
As indicated previously, the optical path s1, s3, and s5 
were not dominant and the optical path s6 had the effect 
of “forced adapting,” thus, only s2, s4, and s7 (87, 62, 
and 88%) was compared. Noteworthy, the shortest path 
(s7) and short path (s2) were more predominant. This 
revealed that students preferred to develop a shorter path 
then long one. This paralleled with the cognitive 
information theory, that human tended to manipulate 
less information if they could.

Remarks: 
 (*)A for Abstract; C for Concrete. For ex.: A->A 
represents the cognitive operation is in the same 
category, which is from abstract to abstract. In this study, 
only the substantial relationships are categorized (ex.: 
s3->s1, but not s3->s1).  
(**)The total percentages of all optical paths are over 
100%, because each student may have drawn many 
optical paths. 
 
From Table 1, we also found that rule set number r1, 
r4, and r9, which showed s1, s3 and s5 having stronger 
association with each other. Since s1, s3, s5 showed the 
characteristic of abstract optical paths as explained 
before. Such relationship also indicated that abstract 
operations of cognitive process were bonded together. If 
one may demonstrate an example of abstract thinking, it 
is likely that he/she would be able to think abstractly in 
subsequent situation. On the other hand, we found that 
the rule set r8 was the only case showed a mild 
transition from concrete to concrete. This indicated that 
the transition of C?C was not as strong and as 
frequently happened as A?A.  
In addition to in-category association as mentioned 
above, the result from the association rule set of seven 
optical paths also revealed that there was cross-category 
associations happened. The two cross-category 
associations were thinking from concrete to abstract (C
?A) and thinking from abstract to concrete (A?C).  
When the data in rule set in A?C (r3, r5, r6, r7, and 
r12) were compared with data in rule set in C?A (ex: r2, 
r11, r13, and r14), the relative high confidence value of 
rule set in A?C implied that when one already used the 
abstract thinking, he/she was also able to solve other 
concrete problems needed to be solved. However, the C
?A was not so significant. This indicated that students, 
who were capable of concrete-oriented thinking, might 
not be so able to make a cross-categories transition to 
abstract thinking.
4. CONCLUSIONS 
The data mining results demonstrated that it 
corresponds with Piaget’s cognitive development theory, 
showing fifth grader’s concrete operation is the 
dominant thinking mode. It is concluded that data 
mining is an appropriate research method for analyzing 
the cognitive processes.
