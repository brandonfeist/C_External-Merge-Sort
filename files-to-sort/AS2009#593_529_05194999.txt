Protein structure prediction is one of the most important 
tasks in post-genome era[1]. The research of protein 
structure could be tracked back in the 1970s. In 
bioinformatics[2], the researchers use of information 
technology and mathematical methods, to analyze the 
macromolecules (DNA and protein), for their biological 
senses. Protein Structure Prediction, in the many 
bioinformatics researches occupies an important position. 
In terms of the basic methodology in protein structure 
researches, X-ray crystallography methods and 
multi-dimensional magnetic resonance methods are the 
most effective ones by now. They can achieve a high 
precision, but a long period is necessary and the molecular 
weight is confined by 20,000. Consequently, one method 
that is effective, efficient, and independent of crystal 
culture, is needed urgently. Based on the information of the 
protein primary structure, to predict the senior structure, is 
developed for that need[3].  
In recent years, although Protein Structure Prediction 
gets some certain achievements by machine learning and 
data mining technology, progress of protein secondary 
structure prediction was still slow, what is eased the fact 
which is that data rich and poor knowledge. Because the 
forecast accuracy was less than 80 per cent and the models 
established by these methods were hard to understanding, it 
is unable to reveal the relationship between space 
conformation and sequence. 
As a new association analysis of data mining model, 
KDD* process model which is based on double bases 
cooperating mechanism consider Knowledge Discovery 
System as cognitive systems, from the perspective of 
cognitive psychology to recognize knowledge discovery 
process and focus on cognition autonomy of knowledge 
discovery process. Trough constructing heuristic 
coordinator and maintain coordinator respective simulate 
two characteristics and achieve self-knowledge shortage 
and real-time knowledge base maintenance, then use 
                                                           
This work is supported by National Nature Science Foundation under 
Grant(69835001) 
 
double bases cooperating mechanism establish a particular 
relationship between database and knowledge base, from a 
specific view reveals that the potential nature ,discipline 
and complexity of knowledge discovery to transform the 
knowledge discovery process. 
In this paper, based on double bases cooperating 
mechanism we integer KDD * model with problem of 
protein secondary structure prediction, and proposed an 
improved CBA algorithm based on complexity distance 
measure of support and confidence which is based on the 
protein secondary structure prediction method KAAPRO 
(KDD * Association Analysis Protein secondary structure 
prediction), which is the core of the pyramid forecasting 
model. This model is focus on partial alpha, beta-protein 
secondary structure prediction which has been made in the 
higher forecast accuracy. The improved CBA take care of 
the unobvious structural characteristics of amino acids, 
received 74.6 percent of the prediction accuracy, making 
the whole model prediction accuracy 86 percent, exceeding 
the current international Known on the highest 81 percent 
of the prediction. So this model and algorithm have more 
obvious advantages on the others. 
2 COMPOUND PYRAMID MODEL 
For non-trivial problems, such as protein secondary 
structure prediction, the general single-method models and 
simple combinations of prediction models, could not obtain 
satisfied prediction results. The compound pyramid model 
adopts gradually refining, multi-hierarchical configuration, 
in which the layers focus on independent functions, so that 
this model get the higher prediction accuracy 
comparatively. Its configuration is shown in Figure 1:

Abstract: As one of  KDTICM[8] theory researches, this paper propose an improved algorithm -- CBA , which is based 
on KDD* model and combined with KAAPRO method, for protein secondary structure prediction problem. Further, 
multi-layer systematic prediction model--Compound Pyramid Model, is proposed. The kernel of this model is CBA 
which is a classic association rules analysis algorithm. Domain knowledge is used through the model, and the 
phy-chemical attributes is chosen by Causal Cellular Automation. In experiment, the proteins bias alpha/beta structure 
are precisely predicted. The structures of amino acids, whose structure are obscure, are predicted well by the improved 
CBA .Finally, the result of this model is satisfied.

3 KDD* MODEL  
In the KDD* process model [7], the heuristic coordinator 
and the maintaining coordinator are the most essential 
mechanisms. The heuristic coordinator simulates the 
“intention creation” in cognitive psychology, so that the 
shortage of knowledge could be found. In the classical 
KDD process, the focus depends on user’s interest, 
consequently much useful knowledge would be neglected. 
So the heuristic coordinator could help the system of KDD 
obtain hidden useful knowledge, and work more actively, 
that the human experts’ confinement would be 
counterbalanced. 
The maintaining coordinator simulates the “psychological 
information renovation”, a feature in cognitive psychology, 
so that the real-time maintenance of knowledgebase is 
realized. Because of the maintaining coordinator‘s 
introduction, under the correct definitions of repetition, 
contradiction and redundancy, the repeated, contradicted 
and redundant knowledge could be processed in real time 
by super graph theory. As a result, only the hypothesis of 
knowledge which is possible to be new know ledges, needs 
to be processed, and furthest diminish the workload. In the 
practical expert system, the new knowledge is usually much 
less than the hypothesis of knowledge, hence maintaining 
coordinator would improve the efficiency of the system. 
(As shown in figure 2).

4 IMPROVED CBA ALGORTITHM 
Improved CBA algorithm is in core judgment layer of the 
compound pyramid model, whose core is the KDD * model 
based on KDTICM theory and improved CBA association 
classifier protein secondary structure prediction algorithm 
which is based on complexity distance measure of support 
and confidence. This layer aimed at taking advantage of the 
association rules which is mining by high purity of ?  and 
?  protein database using the KAAPRO methods in KDD * 
model. The construction of the two databases is up to 
CATH method [18], which the condition is less than 30 
percent homology of ?  and ?  protein. Because of high 
purity database, the results are precisely refinement 
association rules. According to the mining results of the 
refinement association rules with a high starting point, 
based on improved CBA association classifier protein 
secondary structure prediction algorithm, classifies the 
protein which cannot judge by the layer of comprehensive 
analysis and the layer of assist judge. 
In partial alpha, beta-protein secondary structure prediction 
problem, the determination role of the main core layer is 
classify the different of SVM and homology analysis 
voting. Using the alpha, beta association rules generated by 
KDD * system, reduce to the purify knowledge database of 
alpha, beta rules. After repeated experiments of the training 
set, we got the parameter of alpha, beta knowledge database 
for the proportion of support and confidence. Experiment 
verify that the results are reliable, and prove that we get the 
parameter of alpha, beta knowledge database for the 
proportion of  support and confidence can save as a fixed 
knowledge and embed in the whole of compound pyramid 
model. 
In the using CBA process, we break the convention which 
is simply setting of support thresholds, according to the 
cumulative confidence as classify criteria of alpha, beta. 
We do not just use the single measure of confidence, but 
using confidence and support of the complexity distance 
measure as a composite measure, which way can better 
embody the two major indicators in the secondary protein 
structure prediction. 
In the association rules mining process, we also break the 
convention. According to the characteristics of protein 
2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC 2009) 5177
  
biological data, we give up the common protein database to 
generate association rules; on contrary ,we use the relative 
bias alpha, beta protein database. This way resolves the 
difficult problem that the support and confidence of 
association rules in protein association rules mining is low 
and the rules cannot be trust. The experiments proved that 
compare with the classic protein prediction precision we get 
a greater precision. 
4.1 CBA Algorithm Based on Complex Distance Measure 
CBA algorithm in the classic classification issues, set a 
fixed threshold of support measure, which is a single 
confidence metric. It’s equal to reduce to a single 
dimension of confidence and given up the metric of support 
measure. We believe that in two-dimensional protein 
structure prediction problem the support measure 
dimension is also important. In the classic association 
classifier the way of abandon the support measure is unfit in 
the secondary structure prediction problem. The support is 
also important parameter, which is including hidden 
knowledge of classification Rules, so we design based on 
the complex distance measurement of improved CBA 
algorithm. 
Through the mining of KDD* system, the alpha, beta rules 
base is showed as follows: 
 
Table 1 A part of alpha database mining results 
(Note: Condition is composed of several items, that are separated 
by space, which denotes “and”; Support and Confidence are 
denoted by real number) 
Classic CBA algorithm evaluation function is as follows:

? ? , predict the protein is alpha type 
,if CBA CBAScore Score
? ? ,then predict the protein is beta 
type ,and if the difference is neglect, then send the part of 
protein to the optimize layer. This is equal to reduce the 
support dimension, just consider as the confidence 
measure. In our experiment, we found out the protein data 
in biology is typical high dimensional nonlinear data. Only 
using the setting of support threshold is hard to complete 
the problem of protein secondary prediction.  
From our experimental system, we got the statistics of the 
Mining KDD rules for the alpha and beta the rules, because 
of the use of the relatively high starting point alpha, beta 
protein database, so we got the association rules whose 
confidences are relatively high, the majority are upper than 
95 percent, it lost the significance of statistical. So we have 
statistics to distribution of rule’s support measure.

In Figure 4, the abscissa is the support of beta rules base, 
longitudinal coordinates show the number of corresponding 
support. 
In such statistics, it only focus on the number of same 
support in statistical analyze. Obviously in this case the 
high support of association rules is relatively neglect. 
Although the high degree of support is a small port of the 
total rules, this high-degree support of rules is more 
meaningful in the protein prediction. So we re-statist the 
chart, which has the same abscissa of support, and 
longitudinal coordinates is multiple the number of support 
with the corresponding value of support. In this case the 
problem domain becomes a complex measure. We believe 
that the statistics of distribution under such condition is 
closer to the real situation.

Figure 6 distributions of support measure statistics in beta 
rules base (variety parameter method) 
Through Figure 3 - Figure 6, we get the distribution of 
association would not be any obvious mathematical 
distribution, so based on the classic CBA algorithm 
consider a single confidence measure and solely rely on 
setting of support threshold is not appropriate.  
So, we proposed an improved CBA complex measure 
algorithm in this paper based on the classic CBA algorithm, 
which the new evaluation function is as follows:

, in this moment D-CBA is 
equal to classic CBA algorithm. Under the training of train 
set, we can pick up a best *sup

effectively prediction alpha-protein and beta-protein. 
4.2 Experiment 
The test set of our experiment is identical of paper [13] which 
is the partial  /  protein database contain by the 256 B, 
351C, 9PAP, 1BP2 four protein sequence. Q3 is used as a 
evaluation criterion, which is defined to proportion of the 
correct number of amino acids and the total number of 
amino acids.
 Based on the complex distance measure of improved 
CBA algorithm, mainly in the core layer process different 
part of SVM multi-classification and homology analysis in 
layer of comprehensive analysis. As shown in Table 2, 
based on the support and confidence complex measure 
CBA algorithm compared with classic CBA algorithm in 
the same dataset to run on the rate of discrimination.(
Among parameters sup
conf
w  in D-CBA is under a trained 
set of the optimal parameters *sup

result of classic CBA is the best result of different support 
threshold settings .) 
Table 2 D-CBA compared with classic CBA 
Model through the layer of comprehensive analysis deal 
with the test set, get 50.4 percent of the amino acid 
secondary structure was basically decided, with some 
obvious features of the structure, this part was 92.2 percent 
accuracy; further in assisted prejudgment layer and core 
prejudgment layer focus on the more complex amino acids 
to predict, the collection is divided into two parts, one is the 
homology sequence methods and SVM both predict to 
un-Coil amino acid type (59 windows, here referred to the 
collection of NC), the other part is the homology sequence 
methods and SVM predict dissimilarly to Coil amino acid 
type method (200 window, here referred to the collection of 
C). Collection for the NC, which generally mixed with little 
part of Coil structure, therefore we can be used directly 
based on the support and confidence complexity distance 
measure of improved CBA to  /  second structure 
prediction, the forecast accuracy is 74.6 percent. Collection 
of C, through SVM classification will be divided into two 
collections, one  part is Coil structure of the amino acid 
after SVM Classifier, and the other is by the rest parts . 
Then through the SVM classifier and the KAAPRO 
methods, respectively 89.2 percent and 59.6 percent 
accuracy. Integrated part of the results in the pyramid 
model , the overall accuracy of the test set get 86%. The 
result has been more than [13] which was published by the 
results of 81 percent, the results of the test is now known as 
the highest prediction accuracy.

can complete the prediction of unobvious structure of

some points, the model and algorithm revealed the impact  
relations of the physical and chemical properties of amino 
acids for protein secondary structure in space conformation.
