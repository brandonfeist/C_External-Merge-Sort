Abstract-In order to stay in business, nowadays companies 
frequently face the problem of choosing new technologies in 
making new products. To stay in the trend, firms need to sift out 
useful new technologies from available technologies to gain 
competitive edges. In this research, we propose a chance model to 
help creating an innovation diffusion scenario. Three different 
filtering methods were developed in this model: first, frequent 
knowledge and outlier were ruled out using upper bound and 
lower bound of rare chances which were determined by the 
statistical distribution of skewness. Second, a new event detection 
method filtered out rare but older event while maximum entropy 
method filtered out rare but inactive technologies. Third, the 
diffusion path crossing chasm was discovered and its social 
influence guaranteeing a successful scenario was estimated. Case 
study showed the trend of DVD, which followed our model to 
discover an innovation diffusion scenario; the weak-tie, LIETON­
IT, is the diffusion path for diffusing the new technology, H-H 
DVD-DUAL, into the DVD-DUAL social network. Besides, our 
model also discovered LIETON-IT owns stronger social influence 
power to diffuse H-H DVD-DUAL into the social network. The 
experimental results evidence the usefulness of our model in 
building innovation diffusion scenario.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Following the economic growth, customers are apt to 
choose products of their preference. To catch up with this 
trend, firms must produce products accordingly. Furthermore, 
in order to provide better services, companies must realize the 
actual need of their target customers. This problem is achieved 
by analyzing the target customers' transaction using 
segmentation market theory. 
In recent years, as more customers recognized the 
importance of easiness in buying products, more efforts have 
firms invested to overcome this managing problem. Of course, 
this new problem is not solved by the previous segmentation

service scheme. Meanwhile, chain convenience stores were 
established to solve this problem, they were set up to better 
serve the lifestyle of their customers. Because the space of 
convenience store is limited, it could be bottleneck of running 
convenience stores. The management strategy here would be 
understanding the customers' need and put the right product in 
the right spot at the right timing to gain maximum profit, as 
the niche market does. 
In today's booming web market, website connects remote 
customers together to form a micro market. With low fixed 
cost, manager of the website can post many products and bring 
the long tail economic effect. But before posting any product, 
manager needs to decide the posted items from the product 
long tail to keep the store beneficial. There goes the same type 
of problem: a firm needs to fIlter out a new and useful 
technology from many new technologies in making new 
product to gain a competitive edge. 
In this study, we combine the new event model with 
information retrieve and association rules mining to create 
innovation clusters. Based on Rogers [5] innovation diffusion 
model, we first use association rules mining to recognize many 
strong heterogeneous clusters. We then search the innovation 
cluster to discover diffusing path(s) that connects to the strong 
heterogeneous clusters, like the short-cut in Small World. 
Finally, we intend to discover the innovative technology that is 
able to diffuse into the strong heterogeneous clusters and, at 
the end, produce popular product. If all goes well, the firm has 
a chance to create innovative market and becomes leading 
company in the blue sea market. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Market Segmentation and Association Rules Mining 
Market segmentation is a concept in economics and 
marketing. A market segment is a sub-set of a market made up 
3845 
of customers sharing one or more characteristics that cause 
them to demand similar product and/or services. After a 
market segment has been identified (via segmentation), and 
targeted (in which the viability of servicing the market 
intended), the segment is then subject to positioning. Before 
positioning, the basic approach to tagging customers is to 
utilize historical retention data to make predictions about the 
concerns of active customers. The idea is to match up active 
customers with customers from historic retention data who 
share similar attributes. Observing the proverb "birds of a 
feather flock together", this approach based on the assumption 
that active customers will have similar retention outcomes as 
those of their comparable predecessors. 
Agrawal, Imielinski and Swami [1] proposed the 
association rules mining to understand the customer behavior. 
Let {t], t2, ... , tn} be the set of all possible transactions T. A 
transaction database D is a set of transactions, such that D !;;; T. 
In effect, D is really a multiset of itemset. An association rule 
is an implication of the form X -- Y, where X c I, Y c I, and X 
n Y = fl. Let sup(X) be the number of transactions containing 
all the items in itemset X. The rule X -- Y has support of s in 
the transaction set D, if s = sup(xy), where XY refers to an 
itemset that contains all of the items in X and all of the items 
of Y. Alternatively, sup(X) can be expressed in relative terms, 
as the percentage of transactions that contain X in the dataset. 
The rule X -- Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence 
c where c = corif(X -- y), the confidence of the rule X -- Y. 
This may be expressed as sup(XY)/sup(X). Note that in the 
calculation of confidence, it does not matter whether support is 
absolute or relative. 
The Apriori algorithm [2] is the most well known 
algorithm for mining the association rules from a transactional 
database, which satisfies the minimum support and confidence 
levels specified by users. Using this algorithm, the extracted 
association rules can represent the meaningful customers' 
behaviors. Since association rules are useful and easy to 
understand, there have been many successful business 
applications, including finance, telecommunication, marketing, 
and retailing ... etc,. 
In reality, some items may appear more frequently while 
others only appear from time to time. Traditional association 
rules mining uses higher support to filter out noise, and treats 
the lower support items as noise, we will discuss the problem 
cause by this treatment. 
B. Niche market and segmentation association rules mining 
A niche market is a subset of the market on which a 
specific product is focusing; therefore the market niche defmes 
the specific product features aimed at satisfying specific 
market needs. In practice, product vendors and trade 
businesses are commonly referred as mainstream providers or 
narrow demographics niche market providers. Small capital 
providers usually opt for a niche market with narrow 
demographics as a measure of increasing their gain margins. 
For Example in the office building area, we observed that 
many lunch boxes are sold with soft drinks in the convenience 
store at lunch time. But at time, this lunch itemset does not 
appear on the shelf of convenience stores located in pure 
residential area. Because housewives need bread, vegetables 
and meat to cook lunch. In order to satisfy customers' need, 
managers of convenience stores have to understand the 
lifestyle and characteristics of their customers at every 
differential time. Due to limited space, there is no space to put 
all of needed products on the shelves. Every convenience store 
has to develop their niche marketing. At this time, if we use 
traditional association rules mining, the unique support 
threshold value will filter out the rare itemset, the local 
necessities such as lunch boxes and soft drinks sold only in the 
office building area may not be filtered out. In data mining, 
rare itemset may be obscured by common cases. Weiss [3] 
called this relative rarity. This means that items may not be 
rare in the absolute sense but are rare relative to other items. 
Since rare cases may depend on the conjunction of many 
conditions, analyzing any single condition alone may not be 
interesting [3]. 
C. Micromarketing 
From association rules mining to segmentation association 
rules mining, we keep narrowing down the segmentation to 
mine the association rules mining. Its limit is micro 
association rules mining. The term Micromarketing was 
coined in 1988 by Ross Nelson Kay as a marketing technique 
to describe a form of "Target" marketing that is more precise 
and focused than typical "Niche" Marketing techniques. As 
standard pricing policy, it ignores the differences in customer 
segments of specific stores within a regional of chain stores. 
This marketing strategy appeals to specific customers or 
customer segments. For example, consider the association 
mining problem where we need to determine if there is an 
association between buying a food processor and buying a 
cooking pan [4]. The problem is that both items are rarely 
purchased in a supermarket. Thus, even if the two items are 
almost always purchased together, the association may not be 
found. It seems that the data mining has a lower support but 
higher confidence searching method, therefore, the problem is 
solvable. 
D. Micro Marketing and Innovation Disffusion 
From previous description, it can be seen that customer's 
satisfaction of a product is capable of improving his purchase 
intention. But the logic of purchasing shows the character of a 
customer can also influence his purchasing behavior. Here an 
innovation is defined as a new concept, behavior or event [5], 
r never see it before J or r the new product form factory J 
[6], or being recognized as a novel commercial product or 
service [7]. Based on perceiving of new product value and risk, 
Rogers [8] proposed innovation diffusion concept to analyze 
how customer recognize the value of innovation and accept 
the innovation. He divides the customer into five categories: 
innovator, early adaptor, early majority, late majority and 
laggard. Holak [9] proposed a new product adoption model. In 
his experimental results, he demonstrated that when a 
customer buys the new product, he compares the similarity 
between the attributes of product and his consuming characters 
and decides whether to buy or not. From the above discussion, 
we find that both the attributes of new product and the 
consuming characters are important factors to induce 
consuming action. 
3846 
Analyzing the micro association rules mining, if we sift out 
the transactions of new product, we actually just collect data 
from innovator and early adaptor. From previous section, 
when the segmentation association rules mining narrows down 
to micro segmentation, the transaction data of new product is 
very few. As in Rogers model [5], only about 16% of the 
customers belong to this category (innovator and early 
adaptor). Customers in this category are apt to buy new 
products. Also, based on Holak's model [9], when a micro 
customer appears, he preferred buying new products. 
Firms are supportive to micro market if it is commercially 
viable. In fact, as previously described, the micromarketing is 
not viable for firm selling low cost products. Because the 
profit earned from selling these products is not enough to 
manage this type of marketing. There is only one thing the 
manager can try to develop the market from micro to niche or 
segmentation market, which will meet the chasm [10]. 
Therefore, how to cross the chasm between the early adaptor 
and early majority is very important. In his study, Granovetter 
[11] proposed the weak-tie concept and searched many weak 
nodes and weak links to break through the isolation between 
clusters. Although rare association rules mining works for 
lower support but higher confidence, it may be used to search 
the weak-tie connection. Therefore, to fmd out which weak-tie 
has a maximum probability to cross the chasm and to design 
an market growing alternative from micro market to niche 
market are new research topics. 
E. Chance Discovery and Qualitative Chance Discovery 
Ohsawa, Benson and Yachida [12] proposed KeyGraph 
algorithm to solve the weak-tie heterogeneous connection 
problem. Similar to the Apriori algorithm: The sentence base 
analyzing method was utilized to calculate item frequency and 
the frequency of item to item co-occurrence was used to 
format the strong association clusters. Then the connectivity 
for every item was calculated. The concept of KeyGraph 
algorithm uses heterogeneous clusters to sift out items which 
have lower frequency but higher connectivity connecting to 
the strong clusters, which are treated as the potential 
candidates. This process of discovering rare but important 
item is called chance discovery by Ohsawa [13]. Afterwards, 
this rare but important item is called "chance". It can help 
expert to recognize the chance environment. However, when 
we operate the chance discovery process, owing to the 
complexity of the data, analysts can't understand the context 
of the event clearly. How to reduce the information 
complexity becomes an important topic in chance discovery 
applications. 
Hong [14] proposed qualitative chance discovery model to 
solve this problem. The association analysis was used to 
segment the topic in this model. First, problem of interest was 
designated and its attribute was used to extract the relevant 
data. Second, focusing on every topic in the problem space, 
the reduced complexity hierarchical trees were extracted to 
help the analyst to understand the topic. Finally, based on 
preferred environment, the analyst integrate the topic trees. At 
this moment, if a tree has a leaf connecting to other trees, this 
leaf is treated as a heterogeneous weak-tie (i.e., chance). 
Based on specific domain knowledge, the analyst sifts out 
several chance candidates from the database. The system then 
calculates every candidate's social value to decide which is the 
most executable one(s). 
Though both of the two previous models use connecting 
logic to compare candidates' potential, neither of them 
employs innovation diffusion path to discuss the market 
growth. If the qualitative chance discovery model starts from 
innovation and searches weak-tie diffusion path (leaf/chance) 
for innovation clusters. It becomes an innovation diffusion of 
crossing chasm model, which would demonstrate how the 
micro market grows to the niche market. Next section 
describes how to build this model in detail. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
According to innovation diffusion model [5], customers 
are categorized to five categories, innovators, early adopters, 
early majority, late majority and laggards. In addition, from 
inside of tornado, chasm stands between the early adopters and 
early majority and obstructs innovative diffusion. How the 
early adopters cross the chasm and connect to the early 
majority would be our interest. 
The purpose of this study is to find the early adopters. At 
this stage, the innovation frequency is as low as the new event. 
Because the keyword DVD+RW and 2003 is the problem of 
interest, it is apply to the news database (Knowledge 
Management Winner.) 176 news are collected referring to this 
new event, described as following: 
A. Step one: rare data sampling 
Because the news frequency of innovation is relative low, 
the rare character is used to discover the innovation. Therefore, 
skewness of statistical distribution is used to determine the 
upper bound and lower bound of rare event. 
The upper bound of rare event: the average is the upper 
bound of the rare. As shown in Figure 3, the horizontal axis 
depicts the data frequency, the vertical axis depicts the 
frequency, and the average is the upper bound of the rare event. 
Data under the average is used to determine the lower 
bound of rare event. Therefore, the new average is the lower 
bound and data under this new average is deleted to filter out 
noise. 
B. Step2: time and diffusion potential 
After step one, collected candidates of innovation diffusion 
are used to decide which candidates are associated to the new 
event. Because the new event only attracts early adopters, the 
method that Wu, Hong and Huang [15] proposed is used to 
label frequency of every word and to estimate the new event in 
this step. Finally, entropy calculation [16] is used to calculate 
the word's diffusion potential.

Where DiJ stands for the co-occurrence frequency of the ith

C. Step three: environment bUilding and social influence 
calculating 
Only the competitions of supplier and rivalry are discussed 
in this study. First, the environment of every rivalry/fmn must 
be built. Then all environments are integrated together to form 
the rivalry environment. Second, based on the rivalry 
environment, each fmn's social position can be calculated to 
estimate its influence. This process is described in the 
following: 
1) Environment building 
Innovative cluster formatting: 
Based on the new event detection method, if a word never 
appear before, it is a new event. If a sentence contains a new 
word (event), it will be collected in the innovative cluster. 
Rivalry cluster formatting: 
Term of rivalry fmn are also treated as keywords. If this 
term appears in the same sentence, it will be collected in the 
rivalry cluster. 
2) Influence 
Based on the graph of rivalry fmn environment, where VI, 
v2 belong to the rivalry set V, and d(vr V2) denoted the shortest 
distance between VI and V2. Consider a weighed graph G with 
V. When node VI can't link to node V2 directly, the diameter of 
cluster is set to the distance between VI and v], d(vr V2) equals 
to the diameter of cluster. The average path length of the 
whole graph is shown in the following formula. 
In this study, the position of fmn i's social network is 
used to represent its social influence. Firm i's social position is 
defmed as the difference between AP Lo and AP LO-jirmi' Where 
AP Lo is the social network including fmn i and AP Lo.firmi is 
the social network not including fmn i shown in the following 
formula: 
SC firm; = AP LG - AP LG_ firm; . (3) 
If the value of SCfirmi is negative then fmn i has strong 
social influence power. When the value of SCfirmi is positive 
then fmn i's social influence is negligible. 
IV. CASE STUDY 
From MIC 2007 report, the yearly production of optical 
disk driver machine of Taiwan fmns in 2001 to 2003 was the 
No. 1 of the world. After 2003, HLDS (Hitachi LG Data 
Storage) and TSST (Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology 
Corporation) used strategy of cost down and patent power to 
decrease Taiwan fmns' market share. The purpose of this 
study is to help Taiwan's fmn to create an surviving 
innovative path. For this reason, the DVD news is collected 
and analyzed.

A. Step 0: data preparation 
1. The purpose of this study is to find early adopters who 
easily adopt the innovation. At this time, the innovation 
appearing frequency is very few, as low as the new event. 
2003 news database (Knowledge Management Winner) and 
the keyword (DVD+-RW, CD-ROM, CD-RW and DVD ROM 
et al.), are used to detect the new event and 176 news are 
collected. After the association analysis, the result is shown as 
following: 
Figure I. The environment of DVD industry 
2. In Fig. 1, there are too much information in the 
associative graph, that makes the graph too complexity to 
understand. Therefore, to narrow down the data space on the 
DVD+RW is necessary. Because DVD+RW is the most hot 
technology at the time, to avoid the data appearing by chance, 
the keyword DVD+RW appears twice is set to be the criteria 
for sifting out the valid news. The number of valid news is 
thus decrease to 90. 
3848 
3. These valid news are applied to the associative analysis. 
The analyzed result is shown in Fig. 2. After decision maker 
reviewed these technologies, he finds except for DVD-DUAL 
and DVD-MUL TI other technologies/keywords belong to the 
hot technologies of DVD industry in 2003. He also fmds that 
only DVD-DUAL is the new technology in 2003. Therefore, 
he tries to focus on DVD-DUAL news for discovering new 
event. 
Figure 2. The environment of DVD+RW industry 
Step I: data sampling 
In this step the system determines the upper bound and the 
lower bound of rare item. First, keywords are sorted by their 
frequencies. The average frequency (7.493) is set to be the 
upper bound of rare item as shown in Fig. 3. Data items hgher 
than the upper bound are removed. As shown in Fig. 4., the 
new average frequency (2.725) is the lower bound of rare item. 
Finally, the system sift out the rare itemset, as shown on table

Equation (1) is used to estimate the technologic entropy for 
deciding its diffusion potential [16]. The experimental results 
are shown in Fig. 6. After step 1 and step 2, the decision

this case.

Rivalry cluster formatting: 
The name of rivalry fIrms are treated as the keywords, 
sentences included these keywords are also collected. The 
associative analysis method is used to format and visualize the 
rivalry cluster. At this stage, the decision maker just wants to 
know the social network of DVD-DUAL in Taiwan. 
Experimental result is shown in Fig. 8, where the technologic 
relations are hidden.

Diffusion path analysis and Diffusion scenario: 
The purpose of this study is to develop a diffusion path to 
cross the chasm from micro market to niche or segmentation 
market [10]. Granovetter [11] proposed the weak-tie concept 
and searched many weak nodes and weak links to break 
through the isolation between clusters. To create the diffusion 
scenario, the Innovative cluster and Rivalry cluster are fIrst 
combined. This combined cluster is helpful fInding the weak­
tieldiffusion path to cross the chasm and to design an 
alternative for market growing from micro market to niche 
market. The combined graph is represented in Fig. 9. 
In Fig. 9, the scenario shows that if the fIrm wants to grow 
H-H DVD-DUAL from micro market to niche market. Then 
LITEON-IT is a very important fIrm, because it is a pioneer in 
manufacturing H-H DVD-DUAL, and it is also a member of 
the DVD-DUAL social network. This maybe a weak-tiel 
diffusion path to cross the chasm. But if LITEON-IT is not 
important in DVD-DUAL social network, then alternative of 
H-H DVD-DUAL will not be accepted by other fIrms., In the 
next step, our model will check every fIrm's influence in 
DVD-DUAL social network to solve this problem. 
3850 
Figure 9. The scenario of DVD-DUAL and H-H DVD-DUAL 
2. Social Influence and innovative scenario 
Based on Fig.S, Equation (2) is used to estimate the 
shortest distance between VI and V2. Equation (3) is used to 
calculate each fIrm's social influence power. The more 
negative the value of SCjirmi means a fIrm's social influence 
power is strong. If the value of SCjirmi is positive then its social 
influence power is none. The calculation result of SCjirmi value 
is represented on Table III. 
Table III shows the ranking of fIrm's social influence, and 
LITEON-IT ranked as second place. This experimental result 
shows that in all Taiwanese fIrms, LITEON-IT is the most 
powerful company in DVD-DUAL social network. Therefore, 
it is a weak-tie/diffusion path to cross the chasm, because it 
has social diffusing influence to other Taiwanese fIrms in 
manufacturing H-H DVD-DUAL. 
Concluding the case study, the new event usually has very 
low frequency, our model overcomes the rare and noise 
embedded problem to create a successful innovation diffusion 
scenario by three kinds of fIltering methods. First, using 
statistical distribution of skewness to determine the upper 
bound and lower bound of rareness and fIlter out the outlier 
and frequent knowledge. Second, new event detection method 
fIlters out rare but older event; maximum entropy method 
fIlters out rare but not-active technology. Third, the diffusion 
path crossing the chasm is discovered and its social influence 
is estimated to guarantee a successful innovation diffusion 
scenario.

V. CONCLUSION 
In the recent years, information technology advances in an 
unprecedented speed, which has a profound impact on the 
consumers' purchasing habit, they expect to get new product 
in a short cycle, far more shorter than traditional consumer 
product industry can support. From this point view, a fIrm 
must acquire new technology as fast as possible to produce the 
needed new product in order to maintain its market share. The 
decision maker in this study tried to extract new technology 
information from DVD industry news for the fIrm in planning 
its next step product. Since the most frequently reported news 
would cover popular products on the market, when the 
decision maker focused on the collected 2003 DVD industry 
news, he would fmd out that DVD+RW technical specifIcation 
was the most emphasized news in the market of 2003. If the 
fIrm invested into DVD+RW market without second thought, 
it could only segment the market and occupy a small portion 
of it. For this reason, like the new event detection, the frequent 
technologies/items are removed. And then the new technology 
will be found easily. After previously describing, the outlier 
and rare data always is the noise which must be removed, too 
[17]. The time analysis is used to select the new event; the 
diffusion potential analysis is used to guarantee the innovative 
technology has the chance in becoming future trend. 
Experimental results pointed out that the H-H is a more 
innovative technology than the DVD-DUAL. In addition, the 
maximum entropy analyzing result also showed that H-H 
3851 
belonged to a higher potential diffusion item set. The 
constraint of our experiment is that we only collected news in 
Taiwan due to the time frame, and thus, the analyzing space is 
restricted in Taiwan. After calculating social influence, the 
decision maker realized that LITEON-IT is the runner-up 
company in DVD industry. So it has a stronger social 
influence to support the H-H developing. Since all three kind 
of experimental results supported our model, we believe this 
novel model can help firms in fmding the new technological 
trend and bring a chance to implementing the needed 
technology in time and increase its competitive advantage.
