Abstract—Internet is filled with opportunities for learning, 
communicating, and sharing information. It is a valuable 
resource for children and adults alike. However, the online 
world presents some underlying risks, especially for children. 
Parents need to be aware of some of the potential problems 
their children could encounter, and try to take adequate 
measures to protect their children from injury. In this paper, 
research tried to explore the relationship between parent’s 
information literary, the confidence in child’s ability of self-
defense on the internet, and adequate measures to promote 
child using the internet more effectively. Association rule, a 
kind of data mining strategy, was the main tool to manipulate 
the dataset.

I. Introduction 
Over the past few years, a fast growing number of 
households have added electronic games, home computers, 
and the Internet to other technologies to consume children's 
time [1]. Surveys of parents suggested that they bought 
home computers and subscribed to Internet access to 
provide educational opportunities for their children, and to 
prepare them for the “information-age” [2]. Although they 
were increasingly concerned about the influence of the Web 
on their children and expressed disappointment over their 
children using the computer for activities such as playing 
games and browsing the Internet to download lyrics of 
popular songs and pictures of rock stars, they generally 
considered time wasted on the computer preferable to time 
wasted on TV, and even considered children without 
computers to be at a disadvantage [3]. Nowadays, 
multimedia and interactive live video technologies 
innovates the argument of “information-age”. While digital 
content becomes more and more complicated and diverged 
from normal educational purport or entertainment, parents 
don’t regard home computer and Internet as only a toy 
anymore. Now, they concern how to regulate the rules to 
conduct children’s online behavior correctly.   
 
 
II. Literature review 
 
A. Information literacy 
Nowadays, the manipulation of new operation system in 
computer and peripheral seems to become more 
complicated, graphic interface doesn’t substantively 
decrease the perplexity of operation; it is actually 
information literacy that should be the concern. Information 
literacy is much more than knowing how to open a Web 
browser and type a search term into Google. Information 
literacy is the ability to recognize when information is 
needed and to locate, evaluate, and use that information 
effectively. Moreover, information literacy is not just a skill 
required in college; there is “a lifelong need for being 
informed and up-to-date [4].”Information literacy includes 
cognitive activities, such as acquiring, interpreting, and 
evaluating the quality of information. It is enabled by 
technical skills, such as using a computer to research, 
organize, analyze, and communicate. Information literacy 
also is increasingly important in the contemporary 
environment of rapid technological change and proliferating 
information resources. Because of the escalating complexity 
of this environment, individuals are faced with diverse, 
abundant information choices—in their academic studies, in 
the workplace, and in their personal lives [5]. ? 
B. Data mining 
While addressing the relationships between parent’s 
information literacy and children’s attitude of using 
computer, some content of association between parents, 
children and computer was worthy to explore more deeply. 
Data mining is one kind of tool often used to express the 
context of complicated structure. There are four basically 
different styles of learning appear in data mining application, 
they are classification learning, clustering, numeric 
predication, and association learning. Association rules 
identify collections of data attributes that are statistically 
related in the underlying data. An association rule is of the 
form X => Y where X and Y are disjoint conjunctions of 
attribute-value pairs. The confidence of the rule is the 
conditional probability of Y given X, Pr(Y|X), and the 
support of the rule is the prior probability of X and Y, Pr(X 
and Y). Here probability is taken to be the observed

frequency in the data set. The traditional association rule 
mining problem can be described as follows. Given a 
database of transactions, a minimal confidence threshold 
and a minimal support threshold, find all association rules 
whose confidence and support are above the corresponding 
thresholds. Some researches have extended this traditional 
framework to better fit new application domains, in 
particular genetic analysis and electronic commerce. 
 
III. Data and method 
In this study, the dataset of UK Children Go Online 
Project (UKCGO) [6] was applied on the analysis to 
examine parents’ strategies on monitoring child’s behavior 
online. The UK Children Go Online Project conducted 
between 2003 and 2005, this project surveyed parents of the 
9–17 year olds children by a variety of detailed questions 
focused on young people’s Internet access and use. This 
study aims at three subjects. First, whether or how parents 
understand the intention and content of children’s 
manipulation on the internet? Second, how do parent keep 
with their children while they are on the internet? Third, is 
there any activity which is not permitted while children on 
the internet? The deviation of the strategies to there four 
subjects depends on the different level of information 
literacy which the parents have. The research of this paper 
will focus on exploring the relationship between information 
literacy and these three subjects (Table 1).   
Weka , a system developed at the University of Waikato 
in New Zealand, applies to this research, is a collection of 
machine learning algorithms for solving real-world data 
mining problems. Association rule, a kind of data mining 
strategies, is the main tool to manipulate the dataset, Apriori, 
a classic algorithm for learning association rules, is 
designed to operate on databases containing transactions  
As is common in association rule mining, given a set of 
item sets (for instance, sets of retail transactions each listing 
individual items purchased), the algorithm attempts to find 
subsets which are common to at least a minimum number C 
(the cutoff, or confidence threshold) of the item sets. Apriori 
uses a "bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are 
extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate 
generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the 
data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful 
extensions are found. 
Apriori uses breadth-first search or a generate-and-test 
type structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It 
generates candidate item sets of length k from item sets of 
length k ? 1. Then it prunes the candidates which have an 
infrequent sub pattern, the candidate set contains all 
frequent k-length item sets. After that, it scans the 
transaction database to determine frequent item sets among 
the candidates.  
Apriori, while historically significant, suffers from a 
number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned 
other algorithms. Candidate generation generates large 
numbers of subsets (the algorithm attempts to load up the 
candidate set with as many as possible before each scan). 
Bottom-up subset exploration (essentially a breadth-first 
traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S 
only after all 2 
| S |
 ? 1 of its proper subsets. 
 
IV. Result and discussion 
In this research, the information literate parents (653 
instances) were divided into three levels, according to their 
self-determination on how deep and wide they comprehend 
the information technology and knowledge. These three 
levels were are beginner, average, and advanced. The 
proportion of these parents in these different four levels 
were beginner 30.47% (199 instances), average 54.67% 
(357 instance), and advanced 14.85% (97 instances). 
First, whether parents understood the intention and 
content of children’s manipulation on the internet? The 
rules as follows: 
For the beginner: (N=No, Y=Yes) 
1. q12=N q13=N q14=N 85 ==> q15=N 82   conf:(0.96) 
2. q13=N q14=N 98 ==> q15=N 94               conf:(0.96) 
3. q12=N q14=N 93 ==> q15=N 88               conf:(0.95) 
4. q14=N 109 ==> q15=N 102                       conf:(0.94) 
For the average: 
1. q11=Y q13=Y q15=Y 183 ==> q14=Y 180   
conf:(0.98) 
2. q13=Y q15=Y 192 ==> q14=Y 187           conf:(0.97) 
3. q13=Y q14=Y 210 ==> q11=Y 203           conf:(0.97) 
4. q11=Y q15=Y 20 3 ==> q14=Y 196          conf:(0.97) 
5.q13=Y  q14=Y q15=Y  18 7==>q11=Y180    
conf:(0.96) 
     6. q13=Y q15=Y 192 ==> q11=Y 183           conf:(0.95) 
     7. q12=Y 188 ==> q11=Y 178                       conf:(0.95) 
     8. q14=Y q15=Y 208 ==> q11=Y 196           conf:(0.94) 
     9. q15=Y 221==> q14=Y 208                        conf:(0.94) 
For the advanced: 
1. q11=Y q15=Y 74 ==> q14=Y 74              conf:(1) 
     2. q11=Y 78 ==> q14=Y 77                          conf:(0.99) 
     3. q11=Y q13=Y 76 ==> q14=Y 75              conf:(0.99) 
     4. q13=Y q15=Y 76 ==> q14=Y 75              conf:(0.99) 
     5. q15=Y 81 ==> q14=Y 79                          conf:(0.98) 
     6. q11=Y 78 ==> q13=Y 76                          conf:(0.97) 
     7. q11=Y q14=Y 77 ==> q13=Y 75              conf:(0.97) 
     8. q13=Y 81 ==> q14=Y 78                          conf:(0.96) 
     9. q13=Y q14=Y 78 ==> q11=Y 75              conf:(0.96) 
10. q11=Y 78 ==> q13=Y q14=Y 75             conf:(0.96) 
After analyzing the rules of first question, it was found 
that the parents of beginner lacked ability to check what 
website the child has visited. And also, they could not help 
child get the best from the internet. But to the most parents 
of average and advanced, they knew child’s activities on the 
internet, and how to check the websites the child has visited.

q36 child is not allowed to download things (e.g. music, games) Yes/No 
 
Second, how did parents oversee their children while 
they were on the internet? The rules as follows: 
For the beginners:  
1.q21=N q22=N q24=N 60==> q23=N 56    conf:(0.93) 
    2. q22=N q24=N 131 ==> q23=N 122          conf:(0.93) 
    3. q21=N q22=N 72 ==> q23=N 67              conf:(0.93) 
    4. q21=Y q22=N q24=N 71==> q23=N 66   conf:(0.93) 
    5. q21=N q24=N 68 ==> q23=N 63              conf:(0.93) 
 For the average: 
1. q21=N q22=N q24=N 86 ==> q23=N 83  conf:(0.97) 
    2. q21=N q22=N 102 ==> q23=N 98           conf:(0.96) 
    3.q21=Y q22=Y q23=Y 51 ==> q24=N 49  conf:(0.96) 
 For the advanced 
1. q21=N q22=N 26 ==> q23=N 24             conf:(0.92) 
    2. q21=Y q22=N 22 ==> q24=N 20             conf:(0.91) 
   From the rules extracted from the second question, 
research illustrated that these parents of beginner seemed 
not to (or lack the ability to) oversee the content on the 
screen or check the message in child’s email account. While 
parents of average and advanced would check the sites the 
child visited, kept an eye on content, and didn’t get annoyed 
with child’s use of the internet.  
Third, was there any activity which was not permitted 
while children on the internet? The rules as follows: 
For the beginners: 
1. q34=N q36=N 133 ==> q32=N 129           conf:(0.97) 
    2. q34=N q36=N 133 ==> q35=N 129           conf:(0.97) 
    3. q32=N q36=N 143 ==> q35=N 138           conf:(0.97) 
    4. q34=N 158 ==> q32=N 152                       conf:(0.96) 
    5. q34=N q35=N 149 ==> q32=N 143           conf:(0.96) 
    6. q36=N 157 ==> q35=N 150                       conf:(0.96) 
    7. q34=N 158==> q35=N 149                        conf:(0.94) 
    8. q32=N q34=N 152 ==> q35=N 143           conf:(0.94) 
For the average: 
1. q34=N 278  ==> q32=N 274                      conf:(0.99) 
    2. q34=N q35=N 260 ==> q32=N 256           conf:(0.98) 
    3. q36=N 277 ==> q35=N 263                      conf:(0.95) 
    4. q32=N q36=N 262 ==> q35=N 248           conf:(0.95) 
    5. q36=N 277 ==> q32=N 262                     conf:(0.95) 
    6. q35=N q36=N 263 ==> q32=N 248         conf:(0.94) 
    7. q34=N 278 ==> q35=N 260                     conf:(0.94) 
 For the advanced 
1. q34=N 73 ==> q32=N 71                         conf:(0.97) 
    2. q34=N q35=N 70 ==> q32=N 68             conf:(0.97) 
    3. q36=N 75 ==> q32=N 72                         conf:(0.96) 
    4. q34=N 73 ==> q35=N 70                         conf:(0.96) 
    5. q32=N q34=N 71==> q35=N 68              conf:(0.96) 
    6. q35=N q36=N 71 ==> q32=N 68             conf:(0.96) 
23
    7. q36=N 75==> q35=N 71                          conf:(0.95) 
    8. q32=N q36=N 72 ==> q35=N 68             conf:(0.94) 
  To most of the parents in the group of beginner, they did 
not permit child using email and playing games on the 
internet while the child was not allowed to use instant 
messaging. But to another two groups of parents’ average 
and advanced, using chat rooms was not permitted besides 
playing games on the internet if child was not allowed to use 
instant messaging. 
 
V. Conclusion 
Appropriate restriction and conduct can provide children 
a safe cyber environment to use home computer and Internet 
access, the variation of parents’ information literacy will 
regulate different rules, but same group of information 
literate parents seem to have similar manner and cognition. 
By data mining technology, the class owned same 
associations between attributes can be sieved out and try to 
regularize the rules. But it is not enough, further research 
will be necessary to deeply explore the causes and 
influences of these associations.
