Abstract-With the rapid development of computer
network technology, network not only provides the service
for the people, but also has brought many negative effects.
Intrusion detection is used to solve this problem. In order
to improve the speed and intensity of intrusion detection,
data mining technology can be applied to intrusion
detection systems. Association rules are a common method in
data mining. But, it causes the sharp boundary problem. The
concept of fuzzy set is better than partition method
because fuzzy sets provide a smooth transition between
members and non-members of a set, consequently handle
the sharp boundary problem in an appropriate way. In this
paper, fuzzy association rules is researched in Intrusion
Detection System. And Intrusion Detection framework is
designed. It outperforms other methods, especially in terms of
false positive rate.

1. INTRODUCTION
As the network continues to expand the scope and
technology advances, network attacks have increased, and the
damage is getting bigger and bigger. The traditional limitations
of intrusion detection methods include: lack of effectiveness,
lack of fitness, lack of scalability. To overcome these
limitations, the effective tools are urgently needed to help
people find the relationship or pattern of data timely and
accurately from the vast amounts of data, and find useful
information in order to make the right decisions. Data Mining
is such a tool and technology. An advantage of data mining
techniques applied to intrusion detection system is that the
normal or invasive behavior model can be extracted from a
large number of the network data and the host log data
automatically. One common disadvantage of most data mining
techniques is the extensive amount of time required for training
and learning the model being inspected. The purpose of this
paper is to propose a relatively fast data mining based approach
to intrusion detection, in which fuzzy association rules are
utilized for learning monitored behaviors in a network.
II. INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
A. The Definitions ofintnlsion detection
The study of Intrusion Detection can be traced back James
P. Anderson's work in 1980. In April of that year, he did a
technical report entitled "Computer Security Threat Monitoring
and Surveillance" for the U.S. Air Force. The report was
recognized as the pioneer for Intrusion Detection. In the report,
he first proposed the definition of intrusion detection, and
defmed Intrusion Attempt or Threat as the attempts that
premeditated potential unauthorized access to information,
operate information, resulting system in unreliable or unable to
use.
Intrusion detection is the process which identifies attempt
invasion, ongoing invasion or the invasion occurred, and takes
appropriate measures. Through the computer network or some
key points of the computer system to collect information and to
analyze, discover whether a network or system have violations
of security policy and signs of attack. Intrusion detection
software and hardware combination is the intrusion detection
system.
Intrusion detection system to perform the main tasks
include: monitoring, analysis of user and system activities, the
audit system structure and weaknesses identified, reflecting the
activities of known attack pattems, alarm to the stakeholders,
statistical analysis of abnormal behavior, evaluate important
system and data files integrity, tracking management operating
system, identify the user behavior of security policy violations.
Intrusion Detection System includes four steps data
preprocessing, data analysis, and incident response. The
process is shown as Figure 1
'--Sn"""i""'ffe-r""

B. Common Intntsion Detection Technology
Intrusion detection techniques can be categorized into
anomaly detection and misuse detection.
Misuse detection use known methods and attack mode to
establish attack pattem library, and use the collection data of
the network or host nodes to match the data of the attack
pattern database. If we find the current behavior and a pattern
matching, we can judge possible improper conduct or assault.

Such detection methods for known intrusion patterns and
system defects can accurately identify. Detection process is
simple, fast, high accuracy and low false positive rate. It can be
made to reflect different patterns depending on the attack.
However, due to a wide range of means and methods of attack,
and in the growing technological complexity, and misuse
detection rely mainly on existing attack pattern database, it can
not cover all invasive methods and not detect unknown the
system attacks. Thus it is easy to generate the false negative.
How to construct a sufficiently general and accurate intrusion
methods that can be updated frequently to represent the known
intrusion methods, how to improve the efficiency of misuse
detection, it is the misuse detection of the main probl=s
facing the current.
Anomaly detection is also known as behavior-based
detection. It determines whether there is invasion based on user
behavior and the use of system and network resources whether
it has deviated from the normal. For example, it defmes the
variables for the r subject resources and object (i.e., user,
workstation, server, file and so on), and by observing the
historical data establishes the base value for each variable.
When the system activities, using the degree of agreement of
variable and the base value to determine abnormal. This
method has the advantage of versatile, widely recognized type
of attack. It can even detect the system unknown intrusion
patterns. The disadvantage is that algorithm complexity and
high rate of false negative and false positives. In addition,
because the rule base must be constantly updated, if the
attacker knows a system is under the surveillance of intrusion
detection systems, their intrusion are recognized by the system
if an attacker is on the intrusion detection system for long-term
training,
III. DATA MrNING
A. The Definitions ofdata mining
Data Mining is that extract implicit. unknown in advance
but potentially useful information and knowledge, from
extensive, incomplete, noisy, ambiguous, random ,practical
application data. Simply, data mining is to extract or excavate
knowledge form extensive data.
Data mining is an application-oriented technology. It
combines the multidisciplinary field of knowledge, including
database technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning,
neural networks, statistics, pattern recognition, knowledge base
systems, knowledge acquisition, information retrieval, high-
performance computing, data visualization and so on.
E. Data mining process
For the data mining process, the experts basically reached a
consensus, summarized as the following five steps: First, the
defmition. We define the business area clearly, and determine
the goal of data mining. Second, data preparation. Data
preparation includes the selection of data that extract the target
data set from large databases and data warehouse, data
preprocessing and data reprocessing that check data integrity
and data consistency, eliminate noise, fill the missing fields,
remove the invalid data, etc. Third, data mining. According to
the data function types and characteristics of the data, we select
the appropriate algorithm, and Conduct data mining in the
purified and the converted data. Fourth, the fmal analysis. We
interpret and evaluate the results of data mining, convert into
the knowledge of the user to understand. Fifth, the use of
knowledge. We integrate the knowledge analyzed into the
organizational fabric of business information systems.
N. ASSOCIATION RULES
A. Definitions
Association rule induction is one of the most well-known
approaches in data mining techniques. This technique was
initially applied to the so-called market basket analysis, which
aims at finding regularities in shopping behavior of customers
of supermarkets. In particular, these kinds of rules, which are
called Boolean association rules, try to identify sets of products
(items) that are frequently bought together in a transaction. A
discovered rule can tell, for example, people who buy butter
and milk will also buy bread.
Association rule mining is to find the interesting
connections between items of a given data set. Database T is a
collection of n transactions, {T), T2, ... , Tn} and I is the set of
all items, {i), i2, ..., im}, where each of the transactions TiCl ~
j ~ n) in the database T represents a set of items (Tj c; 1). An
item set is defmed as a non-empty subset of 1. An association
rule can be represented as: X+Y(c, s), where Xc;I, YCI and
X n Y = 1> . In this association rule, s is called support and c is
confidence of the association rule. The support is the
percentage of the transactions in which both X and Y appear in
the same transaction and the confidence is the ratio of the
number of transactions that contain both X and Y to the
number of transactions that contain only X. It can be described
as follows:
Support (X---->Y) = P (X U Y)
Confidence (X---->Y) = P (y IX)
B. Apriori algorithm
Apriori algorithm is an influential frequent itemset
algorithm in Boolean association rules. It was designed by R.
Agrawal in 1993. This algorithm proposed follows: all non-
empty subset of frequent itemset must also be frequent. If the
itemset I does not meet the minimum support, I was not
frequent. If the itemsets J is added to I, the itemset IUJ can not
be more frequent than 1. So illJ is not frequent. This feature is
called anti-monotone. It means that if a collection is not
frequent, all ofhis super-set also can not be frequent.
The basic Apriori algorithm works in two steps. First, it
finds frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules, receiving
as input a database T of transactions and the minimum support
for the rules. In the second step association rules are generated
from the frequent itemsets found in the first step. Usually the
first step is more important, because it accounts for the greater
part of the processing time. It exploits the Apriori property
which is based on the simple observation that no superset of an
infrequent itemset (i.e., an itemset not having minimum support)
can be frequent (can have enough support).
Apriori algorithm uses the iterative method of layer search-
itemset k- for the exploration itemset (k + 1) -. First find out a
set 1- of the itemsets. The set denoted by Ll. Ll is used to find
the set L2 of frequent set 2-, and L2 look for L3, it goes on
until the can not find frequent itemset k-. Each Lk need to find
a database scan.

No 1 20,000
Yes 2 15,000
Given a database T with attributes I and the defmitions of
fuzzy sets associated with attributes in I, the objective is to find
out some interesting regularities between attribute values in a
guided way. Any fuzzy association rule is in the following
form:
IfX is A then Y is B. (1)
In the above rule, X = {Xj, X2, ..., xp} and Y = {yj, Y2, ...,
yq} are attribute sets. X and Yare disjoint subsets of 1. A =
{fx"fx" ... ,fx) and B = {fYl,fY2, ... ,fy) contain the
fuzzy sets associated with the corresponding attributes in X and
y. For example.( E F is a fuzzy set, defmed on Xk domain.J Xk Xk
The core of algorithm is as follows
 Lj=fmd-frequent_l-itemsets(D);
 For (k=2; Lk_j:;t:<1>, k++) do begin
 Ck=apriori-gen (Lk_j, min_sup) ;
 for all transactions tED do begin
 Ct=subset (Ck, 1) :
 for all candidates c E Ct do
 c.count++;
 end
 Lk={cECklsupport (c) >=min-sup};
 end
 Answer=UKLK
C. Fuzzy association nile
As stated before, Apriori algorithm can only be used to
induce Boolean association rules, fuzzy association rule
induction to handle this problem. A brief description of the
approach is provided here.
Let T = {tj, t2, ... , in} be the database and ti represents the
ith record in T. Moreover, I = {ij, i2, ..., im} is used to
represents all attributes appeared in T and ij represents the jth
attribute. Table 1 is a sample database with quantitative
attributes. In this example T = {tj, t2, t3} and I = {retired,
children, salary}. We can retrieve the value of attribute ik in the
jth record simply by tj [ik]. For example if we want to know the
value of Salary of the second record, we can use t2[salary] and
get the value 20,000.
Besides, each attribute ik is associated with several fuzzy
sets. F = {.(1 .(2... .(l} represents the set of fuzzy sets
It J it ' J it' , J it
associated with ik, and .(] represents the jth fuzzy set in F .J~ ~
For example, if the attribute Salary has three fuzzy sets defined
for it, e.g. high, medium, and low, we have Fsalary = {high,
medium, low}. The fuzzy sets and the corresponding
membership functions are provided by domain experts or
obtained through an automated approach.

in which, w is a threshold used to avoid taking low membership
values into account. As it can be observed in (2),
operator IT (mul) is used to compute each record' s vote.
The second step in fuzzy association rule induction is
generating rules using the large itemsets induced in the first
step, considering certainty factor.
Let (Z, C) be a large itemset. Any fuzzy association rule
induced from this large itemset will be in the form 'if X is then
Y is B', where XCZ, Y = Z-X, ACC and B = C-A.
Certainty factor for this rule is calculated as follows.
C _ I t,ET IT Zt EZ {aCt (ti I Zk I)}
{(X,A),(Y,B)} - " IT {a (t Ix I)}~ ~.ET XjEX Q) 1 }
Where
Each pair of (xk,Ix) or (Yk' Iy) is called an item, and
each pair of (X, A) or (Y, B) is called an itemset.
The first part of the rule 'X is A' is called the antecedent
and 'Y is B' is called the consequent of the rule. The semantics
of the rule is when 'X is A' is satisfied, we can imply that 'Y
is B' is also satisfied. Here the word "satisfied" means there
are sufficient amount 0 f records which contribute their votes to
the attribute/fuzzy set pairs and the sum of these votes is
greater than a user specified threshold.
An appropriate rule should have enough significance and a
high certainty factor. Significance and certainty factor are two
concepts, equivalent to support and confidence that were
introduced by Agrawal in the domain of Boolean association
rules.
Fuzzy association rule induction algorithm has two steps.
As in Apriori algorithm, the first step is to fmd the so-called
large itemsets which are itemsets with significance higher than
a user specified threshold. The significance factor of an itemset
is calculated by first summing all votes of each record with
respect to that itemset, then dividing it by the total number of
records.
Let X = {Xj, X2, ..., xp}be a set of attributes and A = {aj,
a2, ... , ap}be a set of fuzzy sets, such that ajE F: and also let
j
{m ,m ,... , m }be the set of membership functions of A,
"t a, Q p
such that m represents the membership function of aj. TheQ j
following formula is used to calculate the significance factor of
(X, A) ,i.e. S eX,A) .

Feature to item transformation, used in both training and
detection phases (Fig. 2), is responsible for transforming an
attribute-based record (a record which consists of several
numerical or categorical features) into a set of valid items. As
described in Section IV this process is required for inducing
association rules based on quantitative features. In the case of
numerical attributes, this transformation is actually a
fuzzification process, and for symbolic or categorical attributes
means considering the corresponding attribute/value pair as an
item.

V. DETECTION FRAMEWORK
The proposed framework for intrusion detection in
distinctly composed of two phases: training and detection
phases. In the training phase, the system train and analyze data
provided firstly. The existing rules of the training data are
generalized and summarized, and security model is established
for the system. In the detection phase, using a security mode
established in the training phase as the standard model, the
system analyzes the actual testing data, and alarms and records
the data security models which do not meet the standard. The
accuracy and security model established the learning stage with
security model have direct relationship. So the data analysis is
the core of the intrusion detection system. Here, intrusion
detection framework is designed based on fuzzy association
rules. Figure 2 depicts a schematic view of different modules
involved.
