Abstract—An important element of BBS public opinion analysis 
system is to update the contents of knowledge regular library 
dynamically adding sensitive words constantly to knowledge 
regular library. Apriori algorithm is classical algorithm of 
mining association rules. This paper presents a new method of 
adding the contents of knowledge regular automatically using 
association rule models. Experimental results show that the 
system obviously improves the accuracy of monitoring BBS 
public opinion by means of this algorithm. 
Keywords-Knowledge regular library; Association rules; BBS 
public opinion analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
As a convenient, simple, direct method of communication, 
BBS has been used by more and more people to express their 
views on certain events and attitudes with the increasing 
development of the Internet. Because of the anonymity of 
speaking, the freedom of speech and the immediacy of 
information on the BBS, the relevant departments must 
monitor and filter the BBS information on real-time. Most of 
the BBS Web sites are based on manual monitoring methods, 
such as browsing and downloading from Internet, or directly 
copying and pasting the data from the database then analyzing 
it. Meanwhile, some scholars use vector space model, 
clustering and BP neural network algorithm to analyze the hot 
topics. However, few specifical application systems are 
developed to monitor the contents of BBS [1]. 
BBS public opinion intelligent analysis systems use a 
minimum of manpower and material resources to achieve 
optimal effectiveness of public opinion analysis via 
automatically acquiring and classifying data, extracting 
keywords, analyzing hot topic and forecasting the trends of the 
view. BBS public opinion analysis systems, by which 
monitoring work is completed, achieve intelligent analysis of 
BBS public opinion efficiently. Ultimately, user, who need not 
track and monitor individual BBS manually, will be able to 
grasp the information which user need on the BBS timely, 
accurately, comprehensively and objectively.  
The system needs to build a knowledge regular library to 
determine the sensitive words which can constitute some 
unscrupulous persons’ provocative words while monitoring 
posts on the BBS. Due to the diversity and real-time of 
emergencies, system demands of the knowledge regular 
library not only to detect illegal post itself, but also be able to 
include those frequently used words, that is, the system 
requires the knowledge regular library to increase in a certain 
condition dynamically, and only in this way, the systems can 
detect sensitive posts more accurately. This paper obtained a 
period of posts about a topic from Netease BBS. Since the 
system updates knowledge regular library using Apriori 
algorithm, accuracy has been greatly improved compared with 
the method that all key words of each sensitive posts were 
added to the knowledge regular library directly. 
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
BBS public opinion refers to the collection of emotions, 
attitudes and opinions, which the public hold to the public 
things through BBS expression and dissemination. Because of 
the anonymity of speaking and the freedom of speech, there 
are plenty of reactionary remarks and pseudo information on 
the BBS. In order to create a clean and pure environment for 
the netizens, the relevant departments need to monitor, screen 
and filter the information on the BBS for processing the illegal 
acts and events in a timely manner to ensure social stability 
and unity of the people.

The work of BBS public opinion monitoring, filtering and 
analysis is difficult to be completed by hand because of BBS 
diversity and complexity of information. The relevant 
departments need special software which can analyze and 
filter information automatically to accomplish these tasks to 
save manpower costs. BBS public opinion intelligent analysis 
system can achieve the functions including BBS information 
automatic acquisition, automatic classification, automatically 
extract keywords and automatic analysis. The system requires 
a knowledge regular library to determine the sensitive words 
to further determine sensitive posts, and dynamically updating 
the knowledge regular library can enhance the accuracy of 
determining and the efficiency of matching. 
III. APRIORI ALGORITHM INTRODUCTION 
The itemset refers to a collection of items. The support of 
itemset in a transaction database is the fraction of all 
transactions containing the itemset. The confidence of the rule 
is the fraction of all transactions containing X that also contain 
Y [2]. 
Association rules is rules that have support and confidence 
greater or equal to user-specified threshold respectively. An 
itemset is called frequent if its support is greater or equal to 
user-specified support threshold [2]. Discovering association 
rules need to find all the frequent itemsets and generate the 
rule that the confidence of frequent itemsets is greater or equal 
to confidence threshold. Apriori algorithm is classical 
algorithm of discovering association rules. The Apriori 
algorithm, introduced by Agrawal, has been widely used to 
mine useful knowledge in large transaction database. 
Knowledge is derived in terms of a list of association rules [3].  
One of Apriori algorithm natures is that a subset of 
frequent itemset must be a frequent itemset. Apriori algorithm 
finds potential frequent itemsets through frequent itemsets 
known. Potential frequent itemset is composed by the set 
which is likely to be a frequent itemset. Hence systems only 
need to calculate the support of the potential frequent itemsets 
instead of the support of all the different items to reduce the 
computational complexity [4]. 
IV. APPLYING APRIORI ALGORITHM TO BBS PUBLIC 
OPINION ANALYSIS SYSTEM 
To apply association rule mining to the problem of 
updating knowledge regular library of BBS public opinion 
analysis system intelligently, system assumes that each post 
can be seen as a transaction while each key word of post can 
also be seen as item. Applying Apriori algorithm to a forum or 
some forums with specified support and confidence, and the 
system can determine a sensitive post if the post includes 
sensitive words. Simultaneously, examining the other key 
words of the post, the system adds the words of which the 
support and confidence are greater or equal to the specified 
threshold to the knowledge regular library to automatically 
update knowledge regular library. 
Assuming that a post has n key words, Fig.1 gives the 
specific process of automatically updating knowledge regular 
library with Apriori algorithm.

with Apriori algorithm.  
V. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT AND RESULT 
System accessed recent posts about the topic “Tibetan 
separatist remarks” on the BBS. Assuming that the key words 
of a post include “Tibetan separatist”, “America”, “incite 
defection” and “the EU”, the words “Tibetan separatist” and 
“incite defection” which exist knowledge regular library are 
sensitive words. So the post is judged as sensitive post, then 
system examines the other key words of this post, the words 
“America” and “the EU” are not in the knowledge regular 
library. Through system calculating, the supports of these two 
key words were 38% and 17%. Assuming the system-specified 
support threshold is 30%, and the confidences of these words 
are greater to the system-specified confidence threshold 
respectively. So the word “America” is sensitive word which 
needs to be added to the knowledge regular library, but “the 
EU” is not sensitive word temporarily. 
If the system adds all the key words of each post to the 
knowledge regular library directly without analyzing the key 
words of post in advance, the knowledge regular library will 
become very large, and the accuracy rate and the speed of the 
matching of the key words will be reduced. Suppose in the 
previous example, the system added all the words of the post 
to the knowledge regular library without analyzing the words 
“America” and “the EU” using Apriori algorithm, it would 
bring error to the judgment   whether the other posts are 
sensitive. Only the system analyzes the key words of posts 
based on the empirical knowledge, and then adds words which 
meet certain conditions to the knowledge regular library, can 
we identify the sensitive posts more accurately and efficiently. 
Fig.2 gives some results of the experiments. The system 
acquired the posts about “Tibetan separatist” from November 
20, 2009 to December 22 on the Netease BBS. The duplicate 
posts have been deleted. Library 1 was obtained through the 
Apriori algorithm and library 2 was obtained through adding 
all the key words of each sensitive post to the knowledge 
regular library. The X-Coordinate stands for support while the 
Y-Coordinate stands for the accuracy in Fig.2. The system 
identifies sensitive posts using the two libraries respectively. 
Fig.2 below gives some results of the accuracy of the 
judgment.
 
Figure 2.  Accuracy of identifying posts under the different support 
conditions 
From Fig.2, it is not difficult to see that, compared with the 
accuracy rate of the method of adding all the key words of 
each sensitive post to the knowledge regular library, the 
accuracy rate of the method of using Apriori algorithm to 
generate knowledge regular library is higher, while the choice 
of different support will affect the accuracy rate. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The system updates knowledge regular library dynamically 
with Apriori algorithm to improve the method that knowledge 
regular library depends on manual input and mechanically 
adding new words, so the system can determine the sensitive 
posts more accurately from a mount of posts. Meanwhile, the 
system decreases the contents of the knowledge regular 
library, reduces the capacity of the library and improves the 
efficiency of identification and the accuracy rate of identifying 
sensitive posts.
