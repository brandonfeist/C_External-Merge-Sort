Abstract— The traditional sequential pattern algorithms often 
have some limitations in solving the applications. First, ignore the 
time-interval trait of the event sequences, which is more 
important to the mining result. Secondly, the sequential item is 
also without attribute constraint. As a result, in this paper an 
idea is presented to mine event sequential pattern with multi-
attribute constraint. Based on the algorithm of AprioriAll and 
Apriori, the transition time is taken into account between events. 
According to the layer idea, the key task is to mine the frequent 
sequential pattern first, then to find out the association rules in 
the attribute constraint items. In the end provides a way to mine 
sequential pattern with multi-attribute constraint by example 
analysis. 
Keywords- sequential pattern; attribute constraint; association 
rule 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Mining sequential pattern is an important task in data 
mining. The purpose is to find out the frequent sequential 
pattern in the sequential database [1, 2]. At present there has 
been a wide application in client behavior analyses, Web 
accessing mode, DNA sequence, disease examine, nature 
disaster and so on. Great deals of studies have been done in 
sequential pattern mining, such as classical algorithm: 
AprioriAll, AprioriSome and GSP. Then, it is given to mine 
sequential patterns by pattern-growth: the FreeSpan and 
PrefixSpan approach [4, 5, 6]. 
However, the algorithms often have some limitations in 
solving the practice problems [3, 7, 8]. Firstly, the time-trait of 
sequence is ignored. For example, to the sequence “ABC”, we 
can know the order of events clearly, but the time-intervals of 
events can’t be provided, which usually contain more important 
information in some application conditions. Secondly, the 
events are simplex event, not attribute constraint. That is, in 
many application domains the association rule A?B can’t 
reflect the exact thing. We put stress on the rule {A (attribute1, 
attribute 2,…)?B(attribute A, attribute B,… )}. For example, 
the rule like {sensor exceeding-value log (exceeding-
time>2minites, etc.)?breaker action (delay action, etc.)} is 
available instead of the rule {sensor fault log ? breaker 
action}. 
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
The study is based on the data source in the following 
TABLE I. In the sequences the events have the time identifiers 
that indicate not only the orders of the events, but also the 
transition time of events. Moreover, every event has several 
attribute constraint. The trait is: a) The event items of the 
sequences are few, commonly short sequence; b) the transition 
time of events is more important; c) several attribute constraint. 
The aim is to discover the association rule of events by the 
sequence pattern mining.

III. SEQUENTIAL PATTERN MINING AND ASSOCIATE RULE 
MINING OF EVENT SEQUENCE 
For the completeness of this presentation and to establish 
our notation, this section gives a formal description of the 
problem of mining sequential patterns. 
Let 1 2{ , , }nI i i i= "  be a set of items. An itemsets is a 
subset of I , denoted as 1 2( , , )kx x x" , where ix I? , 
{1, , }i k? " . We omit the parentheses for itemsets with only 
one item. A sequence s is a list of itemsets, denoted 
as 1 2 ms s s< >" , where iS I? , {1, , }i m? " . The number of 
instances of itemsets in s is called the length of s. 
                                                                                                                                          2106
A sequence 1 2, , ja a a a=< >" is a sub-sequence of 
another sequence 1 2, , jb b b b=< >" , k j? , if there exists an 
integer i , 1 1i k j? ? ? + ,such that 1 ia b? , 2 1, ,ia b +? "  
1j i ja b + ?? . a is called contained in b , denoted as a b? , and 
b is a super-sequence of a. 
A sequence database is a set of tuples <sid, s>  is said to 
contain a sequence ? , if s? ? . The absolute support of a 
sequence ?  in a database D is defined as ( )DSup ? =  
|{ , | ( ) ( , )} |Sid s s Sid s D?< > ? ? < >? , and the relative support 
of ?  is ( ) / | |DSup s D . Given a positive value minSup as the 
support threshold, ? is a sequential pattern in D if 
( ) minDSup Sup? ? . Given a support threshold minSup , a 
sequence is frequent if its support is no less than minSup. The 
set of frequent sequential patterns denoted as FS =  
{ | ( ) min }DSup Sup? ? ? . 
Definition: supposing that the sub-sequence 1 2, , jc c c c=< >"  
is frequent sequential pattern, the event items (1 )kc k j? ?  
are established with the ordinal occurrence. The sequential 
relation indicates the association of events. 
The sequence “ABC” with constraint conditions is the 
frequent sequential pattern, then the association rule “A?B?
C” comes into existence. As a result, multi-attribute Event 
Sequential Pattern mining is deemed to discover frequent sub-
sequential pattern. 
IV. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING OF MULTI-ATTRIBUTE 
EVENT SEQUENTIAL PATTERN  
A. The disposal of event sequences’ time-interval 
To event sequence in this paper, the exact occurrence time 
isn’t cared. However, besides the sequences’ order, the 
transition time of events is more indispensable. Deal with the 
transaction time (the record time) as one of the attributes, time 
constraint. The first item of every event sequences is marked 
with 0 as the time-trait, the following items marked with time-
interval. The time-interval determines the transitional time 
among the event items. 
For sequence database in TABLE I, the sequence 1 is deal 
with as the following TABLE II. 
TABLE II.   EVENT SEQUENCE DATA WITH TIME CONSTRAINT 
Sid Event TimeSpan Attri.1 Attri.2 Attri.3
1 
A 0 a11 a12 a13 
B 5 b11 b12 b13 
C 13 c11 c12 c13 
D 22 d11 d12 d13 
… … … … … … 
Notice: The field TimeSpan ignores the second. 
As shown as the TABLE III, the transitional time from A to 
B is 5 minutes, 8 minutes from B to C and 22 minutes from A 
to D. Especially, when the events A and B occur 
simultaneously, the Time Span keeps uniform. After dealing 
with that, reduce the complexity of the table while keep the 
time-trait of the original sequence, which provide convenience 
for association rule mining. 
B. The transformation of the event sequences database  
To mine the association rules among the event items from 
the sequence database, the database in TABLE III must be 
transformed and disposed of. The sequence 1 is transformed as 
following: 
Sequence 1: {A?0?a11?a12?a13??B?5?b11?
b12?b13??C?13?c11?c12?c13??D?22?d11?
d12?d13?} 
The event items include multi-attribute constraint. In view 
of the algorithm of mining sequential patterns, the attributes of 
events are discarded firstly. They will be taken account into 
later. As a result, the TABLE I is transformed as the TABLE 
III. 
TABLE III.  CONVERTED EVENT SEQUENCE DATASHEET  
Sid Event 
1 A B C D 
2 A B D  
3 A B E  
4 B C D  
C. Association rule mining layer-based  
When event sequences discard the attribute constraint, the 
rule set will be enlarged inevitably. The rule like {A ( ia ) ?B 
( ib )} is only one part of the rule {A ? B}. Propose 
association rule layer-based to deal with the problem. First, 
disclose the association rule from the high-layer, omitting the 
attribute constraint of events; secondly, mine the low-layer 
association rule on the basis of first step. The algorithm is 
described as following: 
a) A ?B; b) A(a?b?c) ?B(x?y?z). 
In which, A and B is the event items which omit the 
attribute constraint. 
A (a, b, c) is the event item which contain the constraint 
condition a, b and c. 
B (x, y, z) is the event item which contain the constraint 
condition x, y and z. 
The rule A ? B is explained as the event (B) will occur 
immediately after the event (A) does. The rule like A (a?b?
c) ?B(x?y?z) is interpreted as when the event (A) occurs in 
the condition (a, b, c),the event (B) will be the state (x, y, z) or 
come in the condition (x, y, z). 
                                                                                                                                          2107
When the rule A ? B is not established, the rule A (a?b?
c) ?B(x?y?z) is fallacious. So, the tough association rule 
A(a?b?c) ?B(x?y?z) relies on the rule A?B. The first 
step achieves the rough select and the second attains the precise 
pick. 
The key explanation: 
1) A ? B: Adopt the classical algorithm AprioriAll. The 
data resource is composed of short sequences, so only take 
seeking the frequent sequence into account, not longest 
sequence. The sequential patterns of the events are 
emphasized primarily. 
Algorithm description: 
Input: sequence database transformed (D), minimum support 
Output: the complete frequent sequential patterns set in D 
L1 = {large 1-sequence}; 
FOR(k=2; Lk-1??; k++) DO BEGIN 
Ck = AprioriALL-generate (Lk-1); 
FOR each customer-sequence c in D DO 
        Sum the count of all candidates in Ck that are contained 
in c; 
Lk = Candidates in Ck with minimum support; 
       END 
2) A(a?b?c) ? B(x?y?z): AAfter a), supposed that 
the rule A ?B is established, then return to the TABLE III 
and pick the attribute items of the events A and B from the 
sequence database to form the new database, attribute 
database. Sequentially, mine the most frequent items from the 
attribute database by the algorithm Apriori. In the course of 
mining, we only discover the frequent items, without regard to 
build the association rule. 
For sequence database in TABLE III, the attribute database 
is formed as the following TABLE IV. 
TABLE IV.  ATTRIBUTE DATABASE 
Sid 
A B 
Attr.1 Attr.2 Attr.3 Attr.1 Attr.2 Attr.3 
1 a11 a12 a13 b11 b12 b13 
2 a21 a122 a23 b21 b22 b23 
3 a31 a32 a33 b31 b32 b33 
… … … … …  … 
3) Taking a) and b) into account, get the association rule 
with multi-attribute constraint. 
4) The minimum support of two layers can be set 
respectively. 
5) The influence of transition time. Given the time 
threshold (20), the rule like A(0?a11?a12) ?B(30?b21?
b23) should be discarded. 
In a word, when mine the association rule like A ( ia ) ?B 
(
jb ) two steps are carried out. First, find the rule A ?B. then, 
seek the rule A ( ia ) ? B ( jb ) based on the first step. It 
effectively provides the available method to solve the multi-
attribute Event Sequential Pattern mining.

1) Data discretization and fuzzification: The fields about 
ycValue, extremum and keepTime in TABLE V are sequential 
data, which will be disposed as the discrete and fuzzy value 
before mining. Adopt the clustering algorithm FCM(fuzzy c-
means). 
2) Event sequence database with time constraint: In the 
event sequences database the event items are replaced with A, 
B, C, D, E, etc. The step 1) and 2) is shown in the talbe 6.

3) A ? B: Supposed that min-sup=60%, the result of 
AprioriAll mining is the rule A?B. 
4) A(a?b?c) ?  B(x?y?z): Supposed that transition 
time min-span=16, min-sup=60%, then the result of Apriori is 
{A (ycValue=1, extremum=3) B (ycValue=4, extremum=4)}. 
The last rule is described as A(ycValue=low ?
extremum=high) ? B(ycValue=very high? extremum=very 
high) and the transition time is no more than 16 minutes. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The event Sequence contains several attribute constraints, 
and emphasizes the transition time completely. In this paper a 
method is proposed to mine the association rule of event 
sequence with multi-attribute in the application domains. By 
the sequential patterns and association rule mining we can 
extract the association relation of events. In view of the 
limitation of algorithm, much work must be done in the future.
