Abstract—Ontology learning is from a given area document 
sets automatic or semi-automatic extraction terms to construct 
a domain ontology. Area concept extraction is one of the most 
important aspects in building ontology. In this paper, we 
proposed an improved area concept extraction algorithm. In 
the algorithm, we firstly employed association rule algorithm 
to obtain the similarity between the sememes, and then used 
the similarity between the sememes to find the similarity 
between area concepts. Finally our paper achieves the whole 
area concepts extraction process. By analyzing the 
experimental results shows the effectiveness and correctness of 
the algorithm.  
Keywords: area concept extraction; association rule; sememe 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Ontology learning is a technology that automatically or 
semi-automatically obtains terms from existing data sources 
to build ontology, including extraction concepts, obtaining 
constraints and properties. Among them, concept extraction 
in ontology building is the one of the  most important 
aspects. At present, at abroad and home concept extraction is 
mainly three ways: linguistics-based approach, statistical-
based methods and hybrid methods. Linguistics-based 
approach is mainly based on area concept having special 
lexical structures or templates. In this method searches for 
strings that meet specific template is very important; 
statistical-based method to identify area concept is mainly 
based on area concepts and common words having different 
statistical characteristics; hybrid approach is often combined 
linguistics-based approaches and statistical-based methods. 
Most of them use single similarity calculation method and 
are not conducive to improving the accuracy of calculation. 
In this paper, we have employed a new way to extraction 
concepts.  
According to HowNet, concept is composed of sememe, 
and thus calculating the similarity between concepts could 
be by calculating the similarity between sememes. In this 
paper, using area concept extraction in Open Dictionary as 
an example introduced the conception of the area concept 
extraction and of association rule, and on this we proposed a 
new area concept extraction algorithm. The idea of our 
algorithm is to use multi-valued attribute association rules 
algorithm to calculate the similarity between sememes, and 
thus introduces the similarity between the area concepts. 
Through analysis the result s in the experiment, this paper 
achieves the correct and efficient extraction of domain 
concepts. 
II. AREA CONCEPT EXTRACTION BASED ON 
ASSOCIATION RULES 
A. Area Concept Extraction 
Ontology Learning is from a given area of the document 
sets automatic or semi-automatic extraction area concepts, 
attributes and relationships between concepts to achieve 
ontology building. In general, ontology learning model has 
three modules: concept extraction module, relationship 
extraction module, and domain ontology library. Concept 
extraction module is the most important part in ontology 
building and the efficiency and correctness of the concept 
extraction directly impacts the efficiency of ontology 
building. At present, there are three main ways to extraction 
concept: (1) linguistics-based approach; (2) statistical-based 
method; (3)hybrid methods. The connection between area 
relevance degree and area accordance degree receives a nice 
effect[1]. But there are still inadequate: too much reliance on 
filtering documents; the filter document quality has 
significant impacts to the accuracy of the area concept 
extraction. If the differentiation is not high many irrelevant 
concepts will be treated as the area concept to be chosen out. 
According to HowNet [2], we can see that sememes 
constitute concept. HowNet is an on-line common-sense 
knowledge base that describes objects with Chinese words 
and English words and reveals the relationships between the 
concepts as well as between attributes and attribute. As a 
knowledge system that it describes relations between 
concepts. HowNet attempts to construct a graph structure of 
its knowledge base from the concept relations and attribute 
relations. This is the fundamental distinction between 
HowNet and other tree-structure lexical databases. In 
HowNet, there are two center terms: concept and sememe. 
Sememe can be understood as the smallest unit meaning 
which is the most fundamental and difficult to be re-
partitioned. In HowNet, a concept is described by a group of 
sememe and the similarity between the concepts is based 
upon the sememe meaning. there has defined a total of more 
than 1,500 sememes and all the Chinese and English words 
can be explain by one or more 1500 sememes. More than 
1,500 sememes have been divided into 10 categories, each 
expressed by a tree structure. The sememe in each tree is 
superior-subordinate relationship, and the sememes in 
different trees form a network structure, associated each 
other by explaining the sememes [3].

    In order to calculating the similarity between area 
concepts, our paper at first calculates the sememes which 
constitute of the concept.  
B. The Basic Conceptions of Association Rules 
Association rule mining is R.Agrawal who first 
proposed in the literature in 1993. Data mining association 
rule is one of the current main research modes. It focuses on 
identifying the data relationship between the different areas 
to find content the multiple dependencies between the fields 
under the given conditions. It describes a potential 
relationship rules between a set of data items in the 
database. 
In general, association rule mining is from a large data 
set to find some association or relationship, that is, from the 
data sets identifying attribute values sets frequently appears, 
also known as frequent item sets, and then using these 
frequent sets create and describe association rules. It 
describes the models of the law between attributes occurred 
at same time [4]. 
Set I= { 1 2, ,I I …, nI } is a collection of items, items 
known as the individual elements; the relevant data set 
D={ 1 2, ,T T …, mT } is a transaction database, each of which 
is a collection of items made I T? . Each transaction has a 
unique identifier denoted by TID. 
Definition 1: If A, B is an item set, A I? , B I?  and A?
B= ? , then the expression of the form A ? B is called 
association rule. 
Definition 2: The task-related items in the percentage of 
the total item is called the support MinSup, expression: 
MinSup(A ? B?=P?A?B?. 
Definition 3: Rules A ? B has credible C, that is the 
percentage of D contains A also contains an item B, 
expression: MinConf (A ? B)=P(A/B) 
Definition 4: Supposed the minimum degree of support 
is MinSup, then in the D, k-frequent pattern set and the k 
non-frequent pattern set are defined as: 
kL
  
={ 1A ? 2A ?…? kA | iA I? ,S( 1A ? 2A ?…?
kA /D)?MinSup; 1 k
k
L L
?
= ? . 
The rules which at the same time satisfy the minimum 
support threshold and minimum confidence MinSup 
threshold are called strong rules. Mining association rules is 
from a given data set D finding out association rules which 
satisfy the minimum support threshold and minimum 
confidence threshold. Supposed A,B is the item set in the 
data set D, if B A?  then the support degree of A is greater 
than the support degree of B; if A B? and B is a non-
frequent pattern set, then A is a non-frequent pattern set; if 
A B? and B is frequent pattern set, then A is a frequent 
pattern set. 
C. An Association Rule Algorithm Based on Multi-Valued 
attribute clustering  
In the ontology study, area concept extraction is 
extraction concepts which have field association with the 
given concept in the existing data source. 
The task to find strong association rules can be divided 
into two sub-tasks: (1) finding out all frequent item sets in 
the data set D. (2) finding out strong association rules 
generated on the basis of the frequent item sets. The second 
step is the key to the algorithm which includes two steps: (1) 
generating association rules; (2) finding out a strong 
association rules. The way to find frequent item sets is 
mainly through determining the occurrence number of item 
sets in the data set D. The more the number of occurrences, 
the greater the possibility of frequent item set is selected. 
Association rules mining can be divided into Boolean 
mining and multi-valued attributes mining. Multi-valued 
attribute can be divided into category attribute and number 
attribute and so on. Weather or not the relation between 
Multi-valued attributes exists mainly convert it to Boolean: 
“1” is yes and “0” is no. Clustering data mining algorithms 
is a non-supervised learning algorithm, that is, according to 
some similarity measure makes the samples with the same 
characteristics as a class. There is a smaller difference in 
similarity within class and biggest difference between 
classes [5]. The clustering algorithm includes division-
based, level-based, density-based, grid-based and model-
based and so on. Among them, the K-means algorithm based 
on division method is used widely. 
The algorithm idea of K-means is as follows: Firstly, 
from n data objects selects arbitrary k data objects as initial 
cluster centers; according to the other objects similarity with 
cluster centers, assign them to their most similar clustering. 
Then calculate cluster centers of each new clustering formed 
in the last step. Continuously repeats the processes until the 
standard measure function begins convergence. Generally 
use the Euclidean formula as a standard measure function. 
Mining association rule algorithm based on k-means as 
follows:  
a) Conversion multi-valued attribute value in the data set D           
according to the needs of cluster; Selecting m samples 
from D and assigning them to initial cluster 
centers ( 1,2jc j
?
= … )m . 
b) Using the Euclidean formula calculating the distance 
between iI  ( i= 1 , …, n) in the D and the cluster center. 
The formula is: 2( , ) ( )i j i jd I c I c
? ?
= ?                  (1) 
c) Find out the distance between iI  and jc
?
, and move iI  to 
the corresponding clusters in which each item to 
jc
?  has 
close distance. And form k results meets distance 
convergence.   
d) According to formula (1) calculate the square error E(t) 
of all items in the D and compare with last square error 
E(t-1). If E(t)-E(t-1)<0, then turn b); Otherwise turn e).  
e) Forming association rules; 
f) Extracting  association  rules.

D. Area Concept Extraction Algorithm Based on Multi-
value Attribute Association Rule 
Algorithm Description: The user at first inputs area 
ontology concept sets; and then how to from existing data 
source efficiently and correctly extract area sets interested 
by the user is a core question we must solve. 
 The idea of the algorithm and steps as follows:  
a) Supposed the candidate set of area concept 
D={ 1 2, ,D D …, nD }? iD ={ 1 2,d d ,…, md } is the 
sememe set of the concept i; 
b) User inputs area concept set G. Delete the same 
concepts from G which are similar with the concepts 
in D, gain G ' ;  
c)  Isolating sememe set named iS of concepts from G ' 
and given to cluster centers ( 1,2jc j
?
= … )m ? 
d) Does association rule algorithm based on K-means on 
iS , and gain association rule set based on sememe 
iS '. 
e)  Separation the source and target of the association 
rule in the set iS ', and diverting sememes to concept. 
Supposed concept set iD ={ 1 2,d d ,…, md }and jG = 
{ 1 2,g g ,…, mg } are arbitrary concept node; Sim( iD  
, jG ) is the semantic similarity between iD and jG . 
If iD and jG  are the same node, then Sim=1; if iD  
and jG  have no relations each other, then Sim=0. The 
formula of Sim as follows: 
2 ( ( , ))( , )
( , )i j
M ax dep th c dS im D G
Sim c d
×
=
     ? 2 ? 
    In the formula (2), ic D? ? jd G? ?j=1,2,…,m; i=1,2
?···,n?, depth (c, d) is the depth of c and d in the sememe 
tree; ( ( , ))Max depth c d is the maximum of depth (c)and 
depth (d); The ( , )sim c d can be calculated by the 
association rule algorithm which we have listed in above. 
III. EXPERIMENT ANALYSES 
 We at first input the area concept set G1 = {grammar, 
language, automata, compilation},G2={Internet, software, 
hardware}, and convert the concepts in G into sememe. The 
Compiler Principle tutorial and the Computer domain in the 
Open Directory are used to candidate area concept set. We 
use Precision, Recall and F1 test value as our testing tool to 
test the experimental results. The formula of Precision, 
Recall and F1 test value is as follows:   
Recall-rate=accurate concept number/ total number of 
tested concept                                                    (3)                               
Precision-rate=accurate concept number/total number of 
extracted concept                                               (4) 
F1-test value = 2*Precision-rate*Recall-rate/(Precision-rate 
+ Recall-rate)                                                     (5) 
For concept set G1 we run the algorithm to extract area 
concept from the Compiler Principle tutorial. For concept 
set G2 we extract area concept from the Open Directory.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
  Ontology learning is a technology that automatically or 
semi-automatically obtains terms from existing data sources 
to build ontology. The technology of extraction area 
concepts is one of most hot research in these days. Other 
area technologies such as  Data Mining, Artificial 
Intelligence are used to concept extraction. In our paper, the 
algorithmis a method that association rule is applied to the 
area extraction. Combined with the sememe in the HowNet 
the algorithm largely improves the accuracy of the concept 
extraction and the stability. Due to the specificity of 
ontology learning task in this area there still have many 
issues to be resolved.
