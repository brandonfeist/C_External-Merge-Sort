Abstract-- In this paper, we propose a method to constrain and 
summarize optimal risk and preventive patterns in medical data 
using risk and preventive set with weight (RPSW) algorithm. The 
proposed method was tested by two benchmark medical data sets. 
The experiments show that the number of attribute-value items 
of the constraints was significant reduced and the results are 
understandable and intuitive. 
Keywords--Optimal risk and preventive patterns; Weight; Risk 
and preventive set; Risk and preventive score matrix. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
An existing fact is that a large amount of medical data has 
been accumulated in health care services, which may 
potentially make use of it for disease diagnosis and prevention. 
A number of algorithms developed have demonstrated to be 
able to deal with some analysis of diseases and identify new, 
unexpected, and interesting patterns in hospital infection 
control and public health surveillance data [1]. 
C4.5 decision trees [2] can be used to build diagnosis 
models for medical applications [3, 4]. However,  Some factors 
limit its application in medical data. Firstly, the accuracy 
criterion used by C4.5 may not be directly interpretable to 
medical practitioners.  Although it can build accurate models in 
general, it misses many alternative paths which are interesting 
to medical practitioners and researchers. 
Association rule mining is another rule discovery method 
that finds the relationship between attributes, which has been 
widely used in medical fields [5-7]. It can cause too many rules 
especially in low support and uninteresting rules. Within the 
last decade, a large number of association rule algorithms have 
been developed for mining all, closed [8]and maximal frequent 
item-sets [9]. But many unrelated and uninteresting rules are 
emerged as well as. Classic association rule mining methods 
are Apriori [10] and FP-growth [11]. The comprehensibility 
and efficiency of these two algorithms are their main problems.  
 Li et al. [12] firstly made an idea of relative risk and odds 
ratio into patterns mining. Based on it, mining risk patterns in 
medical data was developed [13], but this approach still 
produces many patterns. A method with optimal risk patterns 
was presented [14] to exclude superfluous patterns that are of 
no interest to medical practitioners.  
We incorporate the weight into our method to judge the 
importance of attribute-value item. To our best knowledge, the 
concept of weight was firstly introduced in [15] to mine 
association rules of weighted items. This paper aims to propose 
an optimal method using weights to extract rules more 
efficiently than the method of optimal risk and preventive 
patterns in medical data presented by Li et al. [14]. 
II. DEFINITIONS AND RPSW ALGORITHM 
A. Definitions 
1) Risk and preventive patterns 
Medical data may be divided into two classes by malignant 
and benign. Patterns are defined as a set of attribute-value item. 
A risk pattern in this paper refers to the antecedent of a rule 
with the consequence of malignant and a preventive pattern 
with the consequence of benign. How to judge a pattern is risk 
or preventive? One of the most often used ratios in 
epidemiological studies is relative risk or odds ratio, a concept 
for the comparison of two groups or populations with respect to 
a certain undesiarbale event. Here we only use relative risk.  
We will define the following risk and preventive patterns 
formally using the value of relative risk. 
Definition1. Risk patterns are frequent patterns, whose 
relative risk is greater than a given threshold. Conversely, 
preventive patterns are frequent patterns, whose relative risk is 
less than a given threshold. 
2) Optimal risk and preventive patterns 
Mining risk and preventive patterns can bring redundant 
patterns and are not convenient to observe results for users. As 
a result, MORE (Mining Optimal Risk pattErnsets) algorithm 
was designed by Li et al [14] for optimal risk and preventive 
patterns. The reason why optimal risk and preventive patterns 
can be mined is that optimal risk and preventive patterns set 
satisfy anti-monotone property. They are proved in [14]. 
Definition2. Optimal risk (or preventive) pattern set 
includes patterns that have  higher (or lower in case the relative 
risk is less than 1) than relative rsik of their simple form 
patterns. 
Optimal risk and preventative patterns are extracted from 
risk and preventive patterns. When the relative risk of risk 
patterns are less than or equal to that of their sub-patterns and

the relative risk of preventive patterns are more than or equal to 
that of their sub-patterns, these risk and preventive patterns are 
ignored. 
3) Risk and preventive set 
Based on optimal risk and preventive patterns, we can 
calculate the frequency of each attribute-value item and sort all 
attribute-value items in the frequency decreasing order with 
statistics. The attribute-value items existed in optimal risk 
patterns can develop a risk set while those in optimal 
preventive patterns can generate a preventive set. We define 
risk set and preventive set as follows. 
Definition3. If an attribute-value item is a frequent element 
of optimal risk/preventive patterns and its frequency is greater 
than or equal to the given expected frequency threshold, then it 
belongs to risk/preventive set.  
Mining risk and preventive set is more efficient than 
mining optimal  risk and preventive patterns. The first reason is 
that we only care about attribute-value items instead of the 
combination of each other. The second reason is that we can 
know the weight of each attribute-value item by calculating the 
frequency of each attribute-value item, and then we can easily 
know what contribution each attribute-value item is for mining 
the pattern set.  
B.  RPSW Algorithm 
If we suppose that 1n  is the number of optimal risk patterns, 
2n  is the number of optimal preventive patterns; supp is the 
local support [13] threshold, then suppn1 × and suppn2 × are 
expected frequency threshold of initial risk and preventive set 
respectively. 
We also define 1k and 2k  are the number of attribute-value 
item existed in IRS (Initial Risk Set) and IPS (Initial Preventive 
Set,  'k1 and 
'k2  are the number of attribute-value item existed 
in RS (Risk Set) and PS (Preventive Set) respectively. So we 
can suppose that Tk321 ]IRi,...,IRi,IRi,[IRiIRS 1= , 
T
k321 ]IPi,...,IPi,IPi,[IPiIPS 2= , their corresponding IRFS 
(Initial Risk Frequency Set) and IPFS (Initial Preventive 
Frequency Set) are Tk321 ]IRf,...,IRf,IRf,[IRf 1  and 
T
k321 ]IPf,...,IPf,IPf,[IPf 2 . IRFS and IPFS should have 
follow property as (2) and (3) depicting.

If ??? IPSIRS , we should remove their common 
attribute-value items because of contradiction between IRS and 
IPS. Then we can get RS, RFS, PFS and PS,  
IRSRS ? , IRFSRFS ? , IPSPS ?  and IPFSPFS ? . If we

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A.  Experimental Results 
We used two benchmark medical data sets from UCI 
repositories [16] to compare the efficiency with optimal 
risk/preventive patterns, representative risk/preventive patterns, 
which are described in TABLE 1. 
1) Comparison with optimal risk/preventive patterns and 
representative risk/preventive patterns 
We use different distributions as 20 and 3 for data sets 
Hypothyroid and Breast cancer respectively. The purpose of 
different distributions is to test popularity of method. 
We set the minimum local support as supp=5%, the length 
of the attribute-value item as L=4 and L=5, minimum relative 
risk as 1.5 is a default value for MORE algorithm.  
We firstly generate optimal risk/preventive patterns and 
representative risk/preventive patterns with MORE algorithm, 
and then accumulate attribute-value items in optimal 
risk/preventive patterns. Attribute-value items in optimal risk 
patterns are used to generate risk set while attribute-value items 
in optimal preventive patterns are used to generate preventive 
set. Furthermore, we calculate the number of attribute-value 
items in optimal risk/preventive patterns, representative 
risk/preventive patterns, and risk/preventive set. 
TABLE 2 reports that the number of attribute-value item in 
risk/preventive set is smaller than that in optimal risk 
/preventive patterns and in representative risk/preventive 
patterns.  
2) The weight of each attribute-value item in risk and 
preventive set 
The weight of each attribute-value item is from the 
percentage of each attribute-value item in risk and preventive 
set. But we suppose the total weight is 100, and the percentage 
of each attribute-value item multiplying 100 is the weight of 
each attribute-value item. The weight of each attribute-value 
item is used to know how important each attribute-value item is, 
at the same time, we can know a patients risk weight and 
preventive weight using it. 
Fig. 1 lists the weight of each attribute-value item in risk set 
of hypothyroid and breast cancer. We can see the first two 
largest weights of attribute-value item are thyroid_surgery = 
t (18.3150) and query_hypothyroid = t (12.0879) in 
hypothyroid, while the first two largest weights of attribute- 
value item are bare_nuclei = l (14.3498) and 
clump_thickness = l (11.6592) in breast cancer. In 
hypothyroid, the sum of the first two largest weights of 
attribute-value item is 30.4029. It means that if a patients 
weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 30.4029, 
the patient is at risk of hypothyroid. Similarly, if a patients 
weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 26.009, 
the patient is at risk of breast cancer. Fig. 2 shows the weight of 
each attribute-value item in preventive set of hypothyroid and 
breast cancer. We also can know that the first two largest 
weights of attribute-value item are thyroid_surgery = f 
(23.7624) and goitre = f (20.7921) in hypothyroid, while the 
first two largest weights of attribute-value item are 
bland_chromatin = s (20.4762) and bare_nuclei = s 
(17.1429) in breast cancer. Therefore, a patient has little 
probability of hypothyroid if the weight of attribute-value item 
is equal to or more than 44.5545. Similarly, a patient has little 
probability of breast cancer if the weight of attribute-value item 
is equal to or more than 37.6191.  
The sum of the first two largest weights of attribute-value 
item is used to be a threshold which can decide a patients 
condition. Therefore, the attribute-value item with high weight 
can construct a risk/preventive pattern using few combinations 
while the attribute-value item with low weight can construct a 
risk/preventive pattern using more combination. The length of 
a pattern is at least 2. The minimum length of a pattern is also 
decided by different conditions.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we constrain and summarize optimal risk     
and preventive patterns in medical data using risk and 
preventive set. Experimental results can conclude that optimal 
risk and preventive patterns are suitable for initial data 
analysis; the proposed algorithm is useful for decision of 
medical practitioners and researchers. The results are 
understandable and may reveal some intuitive indicators to 
medical practitioners and researchers. It can generate smaller 
size of set and provide with corresponding weight with each 
attribute-value item, it is a post-processing based on optimal 
risk and preventive patterns.
