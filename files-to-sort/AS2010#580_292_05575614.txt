Abstract—With economic globalization and the rapid 
development of e-commerce, customer relationship management 
(CRM) has become the core of growth of the company. Data 
mining, as a powerful data analysis tool, extracts critical 
information supporting the company to make better decisions by 
processing a large number of data in commercial databases. This 
paper introduced the basic concepts of data mining and CRM, 
and described the process how to use data mining for CRM. At 
last, the paper described the applications of several main data 
mining methods in CRM, such as clustering, classification and 
association rule. 
Keywords-data mining; customer relationship management; 
clustering; classification; association rule 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, with the development of computer technology 
and IT (Information Technology), human-beings are entering 
into the information era, in which we are in dire need of some 
new tools and technologies to deal with such “mass” data, 
picking up useful information automatically from these data to 
solve the “data plenty, useful spare” problem “information 
explosion” takes to us. Therefore, how to dig up the valuable 
information in the data sea and apply this information into the 
practical work becomes the problem needs to be solved 
urgently, which leads to the emersion of data mining 
technology. Meanwhile, the economic globalization and rapid 
development of electronic commerce is changing the original 
competition rules between the enterprises with an 
unprecedented scope and depth. More and more enterprises 
start to focus on a new marketing management 
theory—customer relationship management (CRM), which 
places the retaining and upgrading of customer value as the 
core of enterprise organic development [1]. With a mass of 
business data and customer information, how to pick up useful 
information and maximize customer value becomes the key 
customer relationship management problem needs to be solved 
urgently for modern enterprises. Data Mining is just the very 
tool suitable to solve this problem. 
II. DATA MINING 
Data mining, which is also called KDD (Knowledge 
Discovery in Database), is the process of abstracting unaware, 
potential and useful information and knowledge from 
plentiful, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and stochastic actual data 
[2]. Simply speaking, it is a process to pick up the information 
and knowledge which can not be discovered directly but with 
potential value from a mass of data. Data Mining is an 
interdisciplinary with extensive knowledge scope, which 
mainly involved into three areas: database, artificial 
intelligence and probability and mathematical statistics. For 
the detailed application, the data mining has powerful data 
analysis and process capability, which can discover knowledge 
as useful rules, regulations, relationship and modes from a 
mass of data, by means of concept description, clustering 
analysis, classification and forecast, similar pattern analysis, 
abnormal pattern analysis, association analysis, time sequence 
analysis and regression analysis, etc. 
As a new interdisciplinary, data mining has an extensive 
application prospect. Recently with the network popularization 
and increasing mature of e-commerce, tremendous amounts of 
historical data and real-time data as well as widely application 
requirement in the business area provide a wide space for the 
application and development of data mining. The combination 
of data mining and existing information system together with 
the artificial intelligence provides important tools and theories 
for the analysis and process of business and financial data. As 
the new business information process technology, data mining 
is an advanced data analysis method, whose main 
characteristic is to clean, select, transform and analyze the 
huge number of business data in the commercial data base and 
modeling process, at last extract the key data which can assist 
the commercial decision [3]. 
Data mining theory and tool have already been adopted in 
every walk of life, and developed pretty good in some areas as 
engineering development, scientific research and commercial 
management in mobile, bank, telecom, insurance, retail, etc. It 
can solve all the following problems in financial and 
commercial areas: credit class evaluation; financial and 
economic forecast; security price fluctuation forecast; 
bankruptcy and bank liquidation forecast; malignant overdraft 
and commercial fraud discrimination; selection and 
classification of security and investment; commercial action 
analysis and sale and customer relation analysis. With the 
updating of management theory, CRM is becoming the focus 
of enterprises, and the main content of this thesis is just 
research on the application of data mining in customer 
relationship management.

III. CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT 
Customer relationship management is a new management 
mechanism focuses on the improving of relationship between 
enterprises and customers, and also a strategy to develop new 
customers and maintain customer loyalty. It means that on the 
basis of continuous accumulating, analyzing and making use 
of the complete customer information, the enterprises 
distribute the enterprise resources reasonably in 
customer-oriented work mode and by system to provide 
support and standard management to meet customer needs in 
all aspects, which can result in the improvement of customer 
satisfaction and loyalty and make the greatest profit for the 
enterprises [3]. The final task of CRM is to provide a basis for 
the enterprises business management and decision-making by 
active market research and analysis and process of customer 
information.  
With the rapid development of Internet and continuously 
deepening of enterprises information, the data amount 
enterprises need to deal with becomes more and more. 
Therefore, to maximize the use of information resources to 
manage and influence the enterprise decision-making process 
becomes the key determinant whether or not an enterprise can 
maximize its competition advantage. 
In fact, the customer relationship management is developed 
on the basis of early database marketing. In the early database 
marketing stage, the enterprises realized that plenty of 
customer information in hand will take them great profit. So 
the enterprises established large-scale customer information 
databases in their continuous customer information gathering 
process. At the same time, they also wanted to improve the 
customer loyalty to their enterprises by marketing activities as 
consumption points and price sales promotion, but the result of 
such activities are not satisfying. Therefore, the successful 
marketers have already realized that the key of marketing is to 
guide the customers’ activities in long term, enhance the 
relationship between enterprises and customers, establish and 
efficiently manage the relationship between customers and 
enterprises. This is a marketing method, but exceeds the scope 
of marketing, it is to establish a bilateral relationship between 
customers and enterprises, and realize the bilateral relationship 
both in customer interest and enterprise profit to maximize the 
value of customers and enterprises [4]. 
IV. DATA MINING IS THE CORE TECHNOLOGY OF CRM 
The objective of modern enterprises CRM is to analyze the 
huge number of customer information by database 
establishing, application of data mining, business intelligence 
and other technology methods to convert the valuable 
customer information into customer knowledge. Data mining 
is the core technology in customer relationship management. 
A.  Customer Relationship Management Process 
At first, we preprocess the customer basic information data, 
sales promotion activity data and daily sales data. Secondly we 
clean these data to remove noise and inconsistent data. Then 
we integrate the data, select the data relevant to the analysis 
task and transform data into forms appropriate for data mining. 
Since the data are prepared, they need to be analyzed. On this 
basis, select appropriate data mining methods and tools 
according to the commercial problem needs to be solved and 
data need to be analyzed, establish model, process and analyze 
these data and finally get the information which can assist 
decision-making. The detailed process is shown in Fig. 1. 
B.  Applications of Data Mining in CRM 
At present, data mining mainly has the following 
applications in the customer relationship management system: 
1) Customer Classification Analysis  
Customer classification is also called customer 
subdivision, which is to divide the customer by customer 
gender, occupation, age, or customer consumption habit and 
purchase habit. The data mining technology can divide the 
huge number of customers into different groups, according to 
which the customer-oriented products and services are 
provided. The most common methods are classification and 
clustering.  
2) Customer Gaining Analysis 
The development of enterprise need new customer 
enlisted. By the use of data mining technology, the enterprises 
can identify the potential customers by analyzing the 
characteristics of customers in hand and their purchase 
activities to make more targeted sales plan. The common 
methods are classification forecast and association analysis. 
3) Customer Losing and Maintaining Analysis 
Enterprises development needs to continuously acquire 
new customers, but old customers maintaining is even more 
important. Many research results indicate that the cost to win a 
new customer is several times more than the cost to maintain 
an old customer, so the old customer maintaining must be 
taken into consideration if an enterprise want to achieve stable 
development. The data mining technology can help to analyze 
the customer lost characteristics, establish corresponding 
model, and find out the potential customer may be lost by this 
model. After aware of which customers may be lost, the 
enterprise can adopt corresponding measures to maintain the 
customers and improve their satisfaction. 
4) Customer Profit-making Ability Analysis and Forecast 
There is a classic two-eight law in customer relationship 
management, that is, eighty percent of the customers will 
bring in twenty percent of the enterprise profit, while the other 
twenty percent of customers will accomplish the left eighty 
percent. The customers in this twenty percent bring much 
more profit for the enterprise, so they are the customers 
enterprises should care most. By analyzing customer 
information and deal data, we can find out these customers in 
the twenty and provide special service for them to improve 
customer loyalty and try to dig out the potential “golden 
customers” by making use of the twenty customer model.

5) Cross Selling Analysis 
The relationship between modern enterprises and 
customers is always changing. In order to improve the 
enterprise loyalty of customers, the enterprises need cross 
selling on existing customers, which is, providing new 
products or services for customers by analyzing the customer 
characteristics and the purchased products or services 
characteristics. In data mining, the cross selling analysis is 
always proceeded by the use of association rule. 
6) Customer Satisfaction Analysis 
The analyzing of customer satisfaction on enterprises 
products and services can help the enterprises to improve 
customer marketing strategy, thereby increase customer 
loyalty. Data mining can analyze customer satisfaction from 
scattered customer feedback information. 
7) Customer Credit Analysis  
Data mining can analyze detailed customer credit class 
from huge number of historical data, according to which the 
enterprises can adopt different account sale strategies for 
customers with different credit class [5]. 
V. KEY TECHNOLOGIS OF DATA MINING APPLIED IN CRM 
A. Clustering 
Clustering is just as the normal saying that “things of one 
kind come together”, that is, to classify a group of individuals 
into several groups. Its aim is to make the distance between 
the individuals of the same group as short as possible, and the 
distance between the individuals of different groups as far as 
possible [6]. Clustering analysis can find out the data 
distribution mode and proper inter relationship between data 
properties from the macroscopical view, search for the useful 
relation between the object data in certain data set and divide 
the records in database into a series of meaningful subclass. 
The clustering methods can be divided into the following 
types by different dividing methods: based on division, as 
K-Means, K-Medoids; based on level, as BIRCH, CURE; 
based on density, as DBSCAN, OPTICS [7]. 
To make it simple, clustering is a division on customer 
group – to classify the similar customers and divide the 
dissimilar customers into different groups. By clustering 
analysis on customers of different backgrounds and their 
various spending habits, spending activities and spending 
psychology, the enterprises can find customer groups of 
different characteristics, and can describe the customer groups 
of different characteristics by purchase modes, which can help 
enterprises to make more efficient marketing strategy, select 
marketing channels and create different advertising campaigns, 
in order to realize the aim of improving relationship between 
enterprises and customers, forecasting the future trend and 
activities and supporting enterprises decision-making. The 
clustering analysis is mainly used in customer classification 
analysis and is the basis of efficient sale, marketing and 
service [6]. Thus can be seen that clustering analysis is the 
premise of customer profit-making ability analysis and 
forecast. The efficient marketing plan can only be developed 
on the basis of exact customer classification, and get twice the 
result with half the effort, to realize the aim of maximize 
customer value and get more return. 
B. Classification and Forecast 
Different from clustering analysis, classification analysis 
means study under instruction, and classifies the unknown 
data into some known, pre-defined category according to the 
concepts of different categories, and uses this description to 
construct category model (normally indicated by regulation or 
decision-making tree mode). The category description and 
classification model can be acquired by making use of 
exercise dataset through certain algorithm. Classification can 
also be called attribute forecast, that is, classify the data into 
the most proper category. Main algorithms are: 
decision-making tree, Bayesian statistics, BP neural networks, 
Genetic Algorithm, rough set theory, fuzzy set theory and so 
on.  
This method is widely used in customer classification by 
analyzing the data in sample customer database and making 
exact description for each category to establish different 
customer models. The future new customers can also be 
classified in the existing categories for the enterprise to affirm 
the customers’ hobbies, consumption habits, consumption 
inclinations, consumption requirements and so on, make the 
“fitted” marketing program for the customer, establish 
one-to-one customer service system and perform diversified 
customer management. For example, in the network insurance 
sale, with the data mining technology, we can use the 
self-study function of neural network to classify customers to 
find the most suitable insurance type for the customer. As 
soon as the customer inputs his information, the most suitable 
insurance for him will pop up [8].Classification method can 
also forecast the consumption activities of new customers and 
establish forecast model, analyze the customers with similar 
activities in different conditions and filter the future potential 
customers. By making use of classification method, the 
enterprises can classify these potential customers in the 
existing categories, if these customers can not bring profit or 
make deficit, they will be abandoned; if these customers can 
bring profit to the enterprise, then the enterprise needs to 
combine the resources and services these customer interested 
and provide positive and individual service, converting the 
potential customer into former customer. The application of 
classification is shown in Fig. 2. 
C. Association Rules 
The association rule mining is first put forward by Rakesh, 
Apwal, etc. If the values of two or more than two variables 
(e.g. different character fields in database) have certain rule, it 
is called association. Data association is a kind of important 
and available knowledge in the database, while association 
analysis is to find out item or pattern which turns up with high 
frequency in certain data sets, just as knowledge of “70% of 
customer buys commodity B together with commodity A in 
one shopping”. Mining interesting association relations from 
plenty of commercial records can assist the decision-making. 
The most classic application of association rule used in data 
mining area is shopping basket analysis, and the most famous 
shopping basket practice is the “diaper and beer” story of 
Wal-Mart. 
The association analysis is a powerful tool to realize cross 
selling. Cross selling is a marketing strategy to sell a new 
product or service to the customer who already used the 
products of the same enterprise. To introduce a new product or 
service to a new customer and an old customer, the old 
customer is more likely to accept it and the success rate is 
higher. Therefore, cross selling is a marketing method based 
on enterprise and customer win-win mode. Meanwhile, cross 
selling is also a marketing method which can improve 
customer value, for the more the relations between the 
enterprise and the customer, the more dependent the customer 
will be on the enterprise, and the higher the loyalty will be. By 
use of association method, banks analyze the association 
relations between the deal activities and other properties (as 
customer age, gender, education, occupation, etc), and can get 
the result which bank services or financial products the 
customer will be interested in, which financing products and 
services is likely to be chosen in one deal, and then apply 
efficient cross selling and improve the bank customer value 
[9]. Cross selling is an efficient marketing method, which can 
help to retain old customers and improve customer loyalty.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
In modern society, customer becomes the most important 
asset of enterprise. Efficient customer relationship 
management is the necessary method to improve enterprise 
competition advantage. At present, the local researches on 
CRM mainly focus on CRM system structure research, CRM 
value evaluation and calculation, CRM management modes 
and application of data mining and mathematical statistics 
methods in CRM and other aspect [10]. While the data mining 
application research in CRM has become the common focus of 
academia and business circles. By use of data mining 
technology, rules and patterns can be extract from a mass of 
data, but how to explain and apply these rules and patterns is 
the key point enterprises care about and also the determinant 
factor to assist the enterprise decision-making.
