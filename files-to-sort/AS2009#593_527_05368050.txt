Abstract—Association rules is one of web data mining methods, 
taking advantage of the knowledge acquired through the web 
log and finding the user’s navigational behavior. Recently, 
nearly all researches of association rules are based on intra-
transaction. They all focus on the relationship among web 
pages. But user is the center of all the internet services, and 
they should be given more considered. In this paper, a new 
method of predicting users` behaviors based on inter-
transaction association rules is proposed. Through the 
improved Mafia algorithm, the maximum frequent itemsets 
with CUI can be found. We generate the inter-transaction 
association rules, discovering the relationship among users, 
predicting next pages the user visited. Experimental results 
prove that this method provides more accurate prediction 
results than former researches, and users will get more of the 
content they want. 
Keywords: Web usage mining, inter-transaction association 
rule, improved Mafia algorithm, maximum frequent itemsets, 
personalized services 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
In the Internet, the most important thing for a web site 
manager is how to make users who visit the web site with a 
comfortable feeling [1]. While the most important thing is 
how to get he wants conveniently for users. Web usage 
mining [2] based on traditional data mining technology which 
is used for discovering users` interesting patterns and 
browsing behaviors. It can satisfy all the needs above. 
Association rules is a web usage mining method which 
describes the potential association relationships between 
users and pages. There’re two kinds of association rule -- 
intra-transaction association rules and inter-transaction 
association rules [3]. Opposite to the former one, focuses on 
the relationship among the web pages in one user browsing 
session [4], the latter one can make predictions in different 
browsing sessions. Considering users must be the center of 
all the network activities, we commence seeking for the 
relationship among users.  
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we 
discuss the background of study and the related works. In 
section 3, a new method is described in details. In section 4, 
Empirical results and analyses are presented. Section 5 
presents the conclusions and our future works. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Basic Description of Web Association Rules 
A complete statement of a web usage mining database 
included a set of n users, U = {u1, u2, …, un} and a set of m 
web pages transactions, P = {p1, p2, …, pm}. We set pi as a 
transaction and the users who have visited pi set as its items. 
Each transaction marked by a TID (Transaction ID) number 
for recognizing simply. 
A formulation is raised: pi = < (u1, w (u1)), (u2, w (u2)), 
…, (un, w(un))>. 
When a user visits the web site, he or she may leave 
browsing history. As the formulation above, w (un) is a 
weight value. If it equals 1, the user un has visited the web 
page pi; if it equals 0, the user hasn’t visited the web page.  
This paper proposed a method that mines inter-
transaction association rules among different users who 
visited the same pages. Through analyzing the visiting 
history, it can predict what the user might be visited next 
time. 
B. Definitions and Properties 
For mining inter-transaction association rules, related 
definitions and properties are given as follows. 
Definition 1 (Sliding Window): Inter-transaction 
association rules are generated from different transactions. It 
uses the data from the whole database, no doubt that the 
computing is very complex. So sliding window technology [7] 
can be used to control the data flow. Sliding window W is a 
block of n continuous data, the amount of blocks named w 
(the number of sub-windows). As figure 1, w = 4. 
Definition 2 (CUI): When maximum frequent itemsets 
have been generated, CUI(common user itemset) is an 
intersection which recorded the TID, those items in a 
transaction of the original data has been occurred at the same 
time. 
Definition 3(Support): The support of association rules 
YX ? equals the support of YX ? .  If support value is 
large, the association rule is important, otherwise it is useless. 
The formulations are:

rules YX ?  can be determined whether the rule is credible. 
The formulation is:

Definition 5(Maximum Frequent Itemset): X which 
includes some items was a set in database D. When 
supmin)(sup ?Xport , X is the frequent itemset. When X 
without any supersets, it can be called maximum frequent 
itemset. 
Property 1: Any proper subsets of frequent itemsets are 
not maximum frequent itemsets.  
Definition 6(Inter-transaction association rules): An 
inter-transaction association rule YX ?  can be defined as 
follows: 
1. ., ???? YX  
2. .1,)0( uiXei ????  
3. .0,1,)( ????? juiYjei  
III. THE INTER-TRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES 
BASED ON MAXIMUM FREQUENT ITEMSET 
The aim of web usage mining is to supply better services 
to users. We will achieve it through 3 steps. They are data 
preparation, model discovery and association rules 
generation. 
A. Data Preparation 
The data from web logs can’t be used directly. This step 
is important to the accuracy of the result [8, 9], and it’s 
necessary for a better discovering result of inter-transaction 
association rules. It filters the redundant data, and then 
transforms the data format. 
B. Pattern Discovery 
Through the improved Mafia algorithm, the MFI 
(maximum frequent itemset) and CUI (common user itemset) 
can be generated. We converse intra-transaction to inter-
transaction, and analyze the inclusion relation of different 
items in sliding window. Users’ interesting was found in the 
final.  
Steps are as follows: 
Step 1: Find out and store the MFI in appropriate format. 
In the Internet, the information is huge. So Mafia which 
can manipulate huge data efficiently was chosen. However, 
it can’t record the TID intersection of which items in original 
database occurs at the same transaction. So we improved it. 
Now it can not only find the MFI, but also stores the useful 
TID intersection, which we called CUI. 
 
Algorithm 1: Generating MFI and the relative CUI with 
improved Mafia algorithm: 
Input: The whole database. 
Output: MFI and CUI. 
input the database 
///Mafia 
//Creating DFS space and candidate itemsets tree 
Simple(Current node C, MFI) 
{......  } 
//Three kinds of pruning mechanisms 
//1.Parent Equivalence Pruning

//2.HUTMFI Superset Pruning

///Generating the CUI for each transaction in MFI. 
//Acquiring the TID occurs in original database. 
read from the original database; 
for (get a line) 
{ 
      store each(transnum1,Tidset1) in table1; 
} 
end for 
//Creating CUI 
 read from the file included maximum frequent itemsets 
information ; 
for (get a line from MFI) 
{ 
      split every number in every MFI; 
      find (transnum2, Tidset2) in table1; 
      store (transnum2, Tidset2); 
      //Intersect 
      intersect (transnum2) named CUI; 
      //(Tidset2,CUI) is the every transaction in MFI and 
the relative CUI 
store (Tidset2,CUI) 
  } 
  end for 
CUI is the key to mine inter-transaction association rules. 
Because of comparing the inclusion relation of CUIs, we can 
find the association rules. 
148
 
Step 2: Transforming the MFI from intra-transaction to 
inter-transaction. 
Through the continuous moving of sliding window, the 
value of CUI has changed by pruning method. When it 
cannot satisfy the pruning criterion, it will be eliminated. 
Finally, the user pattern was generated. 
  The beginning of each sliding window is a nonempty 
transaction. Assuming that t represents a TID which is stored 
in CUI, n was the number of a sub-window. If t appears in 
nth sub-window, t must exist in the sliding window which 
started at t-n+1. If t-n+1 satisfied the following pruning 
methods, we eliminated the transaction included t-n+1. 
Pruning criterion: 
1. If the item in TIDset is less than 0, equal to 0, beyond 
the max transaction or contains nothing. 
2. If two TIDsets included each other, only leave the set 
which contained another. 
Algorithm 2: Transforming the MFI to inter-transaction 
MFI, for generating the user pattern. 
Input: MFI and CUI which brought by algorithm 1. 
Output: Inter-transaction MFI and user pattern. 
read from the result of algorithm 1; 
for(1?n?w); 
for(Tidset, Transaction num2) 
{ 
  New Transaction num = t – n +1; 
  Add New_Transaction num to New Intra-transaction 
Maximum Frequent Itemsets; 
} 
///Pruning method 
for(each New Transaction) 
  //Method 1 
  if(New Transaction num ? 0 || New Transaction num= 
? || New Transaction num > Max Tidset number ) 
  delete New Transaction num; 
  //Method 2 
  if(New Tidset 1 ? New Tidset 2) 
  delete New Tidset 1; 
end for 
With the methods above, the inter-transaction MFI has 
been discovered, and then the inter-transaction association 
rules can be discovered. 
C. Inter-transaction Association Rules Generation 
The inter-transaction MFI was found in step 2, giving a 
minconf value and finding out the contain relation between 
sub-window[1] and the posterior sub-windows (see table 3), 
the association rules could be build if some items were 
contained in other items [4]. Otherwise, we run the pruning 
mechanisms till the last sub-window [10]. 
For example, in figure 3, the rate of inclusive relation 
between sub-window[2] and sub-window[1] is 67%, this 
value is greater than the value of mincof -- 60%, then the 
association rule can be generated as sub-window[1]?  sub-
window[2]. 
IV. EXPERIMENTS RESULTS 
The database used in experiments includes 17 different 
tags in a website.  
Firstly, the format of this database was as table 1, after 
data preparation, the format is adjusted as table 2. 
TABLE I.  THE ORIGINAL FORMAT 
Users Web pages 
U1 Homepage, Homepage, … 
U2 Weather, … 
U3 Tech, Weather, Weather, …  
U4 Living, … 
U5 Homepage, … 
… … 
TABLE II.   FORMAT AFTER TRANSFORMED 
Web pages Users 
Homepage U1, U5, U7, U11, … 
Weather U2, U3, … 
Tech U3, U10, …  
Politics U4, U10 , … 
Living U6, U8, U9, U10, … 
… … 
Next, MFI is generated by using the data in table 2. 
Assuming sliding window number is 4, the minsup is 40%. 
Using algorithm 1, MFI and CUI can be found. Then we 
transform intra-transaction MFI to inter-transaction MFI. 
The result can be seen as table 3. 
TABLE III.  USING SLIDING WINDOW TRANSFORMS THE MAXIMUM 
FREQUENT ITEMSETS FROM INTRA-TRANSACTION TO INTER-

10 U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [3] 2 3 4 5 8 11 
11 U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4] 1 2 3 4 7 10 
The minsup is 40%. The minconf is 60%, we named it as 
a fault-tolerance value, if the rate of right recommending 
pages above or equal 60%, that means the recommending 
results would satisfy the users` expectation. 
149
For example, from column of CUI, there are 67% of 
same items in line 7 are included in line 1. This value is 
above the minconf. So one association rule can be generated 
as U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1]?  U1, U12, U6, 
U13 [2], and the confidence value is 67%. 
   According to the method mentioned above, all the 
association rules can be generated as follows: 
U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1]?  U1, U12, U6, 
U13 [2], the confidence value is 67%. 
U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U1, U12, U6, 
U13 [2], the confidence value is 67%. 
U1, U12, U6, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [2], the 
confidence value is 83%. 
U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1] ?  U1, U12, U6, 
U13 [3], the confidence value is 63%. 
U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U1, U12, U6, 
U13 [3], the confidence value is 83%. 
U11, U4, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U1, U12, U6, U13 [3], the 
confidence value is 67%. 
U4, U2, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U1, U12, U6, U13 [3], the 
confidence value is 67%. 
U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, U6, 
U14, U13 [3], the confidence value is 67%. 
U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, 
U6, U14, U13 [3], the confidence value is 67%. 
U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, U6, 
U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 67%. 
U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, 
U6, U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 83%. 
U11, U4, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 
[4], the confidence value is 67%. 
U4, U2, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4], 
the confidence value is 67%. 
If the right sides of association rules are the same, keep 
the bigger confidence value ones, abandon the smaller. 
Finally, the inter-transaction association rules are: 
U1, U12, U6, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [2], the 
confidence value is 83%. 
U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U1, U12, U6, 
U13 [3], the confidence value is 83%. 
U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] ?  U16, U12, 
U6, U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 83%. 
From the first of the three rules, we can tell that when U16 
visits website, he/she may be interested in the content that U1, 
U12, U6, U13 like. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes a new method based on improved 
Mafia algorithm, when it generates MFI, it also generates 
CUI. Using the inclusive relation between CUIs, the inter-
transaction association rules can be found. This method is 
easier and much more efficient compared to the traditional 
association rules. It can not only recommend more pages to 
users, but also inherited the superiority of Mafia algorithm 
which deals with huge database efficiently.
