Abstract- There are various algorithm for finding frequent 
itemsets one of them is the Association rule mining. 
Association rule mining uses an algorithm called apriori to 
find frequent itemsets. But due to some limitations viz. 
producing large number of candidate itemsets, which results 
in frequent database scanning while finding frequent 
itemsets. For solution of all these drawbacks, here new 
algorithm is introduced named, Modified RAAT (Reduced 
Apriori Algorithm using Tag). Modified RAAT is more 
efficient because it performs reduction in database scan time 
by using a special feature named Tag parameter, A Tag 
parameter includes three more parameters: minimum, 
maximum and total number of items in a particular 
transaction. One can conclude  the following by Comparing 
this Tag value with a transaction containing particular 
itemset, Mismatching of the parameters requires no further 
usage of that transaction. By counting the change in support 
parameter the Modified RAAT algorithm may also find 
various emerging patterns like JEP (jumping emerging 
pattern). The pattern whose support changes abruptly from 
zero to nonzero is classified as JEP. This concept is designed 
by using border-based approach to find most expressive 
JEP. 
 
Keywords-  EP, JEP, Modified RAAT 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Association rule mining is one of the interesting areas of 
Data Mining. Association rule mining finds the interesting 
or correlation relationship among a large set of data items. 
    E.g. The market basket problem assumes we have some 
large number of items e.g. “bread” ,”butter”. Customer fills 
their market basket with some subset of the items n we get to 
know what items people buy together, even if we don’t know 
who they are. Marketers use this information to position 
items and control the way a typical customer traverses the 
store. For example in practical usage we can consider it as 
following: 
   A. Baskets = documents, items = words. Words 
appearing frequently together in documents may represent 
phrase or linked conception. And can be used for intelligence 
gathering. 
   B. Baskets = sentences; items= documents. Two 
documents with many of the same sentences could 
represent plagiarism or mirror sites on web. 
 
II. CURRENT SYSTEM 
 
A. Reduced Apriori Algorithm using Tag  (RAAT) 
 
Algorithm: RAAT  
Enter: a database D, min-sup 
Output: all the frequent itemsets of the   database 
1)  L1 = (frequent 1-Items); 
2)  C2 = L1 ? L1; 
3)  for all candidates c ? C2 do 
4)   Ct = subset '(C2, t); 
5)   for all candidates c ? Ct   
                      do 
6)   c.count + +;       
7)  end; 
8)         L2 = (c ? C | c.count ? min-sup) 
9)    end; 
10)   for (k = 3; Lk-1; k + +) do begin 
11)   Ck = apriori_gen (Lk-1); 
12)    for all transactions t ? D   
            Do begin 
13)   Ct  = subset '(Ck, t); 
14)     for all candidates c ? Ct  do 
15)   c.count + +; 
16)  end; 
17)     Lk = (c ? C | c.count ? min-sup) 
18)  end; 
19)  Answer = Uk Lk; 
 
Subset '(Ck, t) includes the following steps: 
a) for all candidate s ? Ck  
b) { 
c)   If (first item of s > = min)   ?   (last item of s <=max); 
d)   subset = subset + (s); 
e)  };

III. NEW APPROACH (EIRAAT) 
 
Algorithm Apriori is one of the oldest and most versatile 
algorithms of Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM). Its 
advantages and its moderate traverse of the search space 
pay off when mining very large databases. Proposed 
algorithm improves Apriori algorithm by the way of a 
decrease of pruning operations, which generates the 
candidate 2-itemsets by the apriori-gen operation. 
Besides, it adopts the tag-counting method to calculate 
support quickly. So the bottleneck is overcome [9]. 
 
A. Proposed Algorithm 
Name: Modified RAAT(Reduced Apriori Algorithm 
using Tag) for Efficiency Improvement with 
EP(emerging pattern)  and JEP(Jumping EP)  
Input:    1) Minimum support threshold 
      2) Database. 
Output: 1) Frequent Itemsets 
             2) Emerging pattern, jumping emerging pattern. 
 
Notations: 
 n = total number of items   within particular transaction 
 
Steps: 
1. Scan database and add the parameter (min_value, 
max_value, n) with each transaction.  
2. for all transactions  
{ 
Count candidate frequent itemset compare items of 
itemset with the added parameter. 
(a) If it doesn’t match then that transaction is not 
considered. 
(b) If it does match then compare each and every item 
of itemset with each each and every item of particular 
transaction. 
} 
3. Prepare final table of candidate frequent itemset. 
4. Find out test item/pattern by using MBDLLBORDER 
algorithm.[6] 
Repeat for all test item/pattern 
{ 
Find out subsets of particular test item and accordingly 
make classes.  
Observe the change in support parameter from one class 
of data to another. 
a) If there is a normal change in support then that test 
pattern is classified as EP (emerging pattern). 
b) If there is an abrupt change in  support from zero to   
nonzero then that test pattern is classified as JEP 
(jumping emerging pattern).

V. CONCLUSION 
 
Apriori and RAAT (Reduced Apriori Algorithm using 
Tag) has the drawback of large number of candidate 
itemset generation. So as further improvement Modified 
RAAT (Reduced Apriori Algorithm using Tag) is 
proposed here. This algorithm is proposed to improve 
efficiency for more than 2-candidate itemsets by using 
modified Tag parameter. Modified tag parameter includes 
three arguments (minimum number, maximum number, 
total number of items) for particular transaction. With the 
decrease of minimum support to some content, the 
Improved Apriori algorithm tends to prevail; and with the 
further decrease of minimum support, the advantage of 
the Improved Apriori algorithm can be greatly enhanced.
