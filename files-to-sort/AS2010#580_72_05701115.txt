I. INTRODUCTION 
With the globalization of supply chain and 
the development of competitive system and 
information technology, the logistics becomes 
more and more complex, and the cost of 
logistics increases and capital becomes more 
intensive. As a new model of logistics, the 
third-party logistics plays an important role in 
reducing the company’s logistics cost and in 
enhancing the competitive edge. Under the 
logistics information system, the third-party 
logistics corporations could build up the 
relationship between the various sectors of a 
company; the company and supplier; the 
company and the consumers ; the company and 
government on the net, and coordinate and 
corporate between each other.  
   When the third-party logistics information 
system serves as business running and decision- 
making platform, the safety of the system is 
much worried by the decision makers, because 
any change and leaking of information resource 
or the destroy of information resource could 
bring to the company inestimable economy loss 
and even could endanger the company’s 
survival and development. Besides, logistics 
information management system, which based 
on traditional data-bank, neglects the analysis of 
information and it causes inconvenience to 
decision makers. The third-party logistics, as a 
complex system, yields a large amount of data 
every moment. The various data store in 
logistics information management system 
distributed in various data bank with different 
storage means and data format. Therefore, it 
turns out to be an important problem needed to 
be solved as how to make use of advanced data 
mining technology and to search useful 
information among multi-sources and 
heterogeneous data and ensure the safety of 
information management data, thus to better 
serve the third-party logistics in the aspect of 
decision making.
.THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENT 
AND SAFETY OF PRESENT 
THIRD-PARTY LOGISTICS 
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 
The connection in logistics system is 
achieved through information. The dispatch of 
basic resource is achieved by sharing the 
information resource too. So the arrangement of 
logistics activities should base on information. 
In order to make logistics activities go smoothly 
and regularly, it is important for us to ensure the 
safety and accessibility of these activities. The 
network of logistics information is just the way 
which aims to make the logistics information be 
shared by business sectors, various businesses 
and even businesses worldwide with the help of 
modern information technology. The logistics 
information management is the process to 
analyze, search, study, report, exchange logistics 
information and offer these services by planning, 
organizing, commanding, coordinating and 
manipulating, so that it could effectively make 
use of manpower, materials and capital to reach 
an overall target of logistics management. It is a 
dynamic development concept, its denotative 
and connotative meanings will change along 
with the enhancement of logistics management 
practice and development of logistics 
management, along with the development of 
information technology, the logistics 
information system comes into being based on 
information technology. By adopting computer 
technology and communication technology, the 
logistics information management system is a

human-machine system which collects, 
catalogues, processes, stores logistics 
information and offers service etc. It can 
exchange long-distance information and process 
huge data of information, and it can play an 
important role in e-commerce circulation, 
accounting treatment and business management.  
According to the features of information 
system and logistics, the functions of the 
third-party logistics information management 
model are shown as follows: data collecting and 
inputting, information storage, information 
process, information transmission, information 
searching and inquiring and outputting. It is 
quite obvious that information management 
requires processing and transmitting huge 
accurate data, such as market supply quantity, 
supply price and demand quantity, demand price 
and storage quantity, assortment, quality and 
size. 
Any missing or mistake in information can 
directly affect the decision making and carrying 
out the decisions, and eventually will influence 
the effect of logistics management and economy 
efficiency of company. The safety of the 
third-party logistics information management 
model includes the safety of external 
information exchange and the safety of internal 
information processing. The safety of 
information management is threatened when a 
company exchanges information with other 
companies such as accepting the ordering, 
sending back the information on the net. Some 
measures must be taken due to insecurity on the 
net, such as network attack from hackers, virus 
spreading and unsafe network system. As for the 
safe internal information processing, firstly it 
must be done under the safe operating system, 
this is the basic requirement of company 
logistics information. Secondly, it requires a 
qualified work team who are self-disciplined 
and law-abiding, which is key link to ensure the 
safety of information system operating.  
From the perspective of information 
system, the core of the safety of logistics 
information system is to ensure the normal 
operating of information system and the safety 
of data. Information system safety involves the 
problems of the safety of net, servers, storage 
device and operating system, reliability of 
back-up solution and clustering technique, 
electrical supply, the computing environment, 
computer virus and unauthorized access, 
computer system management. Data safety 
refers to ensure the safety of data, which means 
the data would not miss and be changed and 
destroyed and stolen; the insecurity of data 
processing will cause great loss to business. 
Although the information has the characteristics 
of sharing and not equaling to zero, the various 
businesses may get imbalanced information of 
the demand of market, so it will still erode the 
competitiveness of businesses if key 
information is leaked and will put the business 
at a serious disadvantage. So logistics 
information system safety is a safety project. 
. Safety Third -Party Logistics Information 
Management Model Based on Data Mining 
A. The safety model of third-party 
information management  
 
   As what is discussed above, in order to 
make logistics activities go smoothly and 
regularly, it is important for us to ensure the 
safety and accessibility of these activities. 
Third-party logistics information management 
model bears networking feature, and the 
information is transmitted through network, so 
the safety of network is quite important for the 
logistics information management. Because of 
the openness of network, insecurity of 
communications protocol, and because of data 
storage and data processing on the net and 
because users access data from many different 
sources distributed throughout network 
environment, it is more likely that data 
transmitted on the net is leaked or destroyed, 
and the network is likely to be attacked severely. 
We could adopt information Protection System 
(or Dynamic Information Security Theory) in 
order to ensure the safety and accessibility of 
logistics information. We construct Information 
Protection System, that is, P2DAR model 
shown on Fig 1. This model provides an 
available method of securing logistics 
information management. P2DAR model 
consists of Policy, Protection, Detection, 
Analyze and Response. Protection, Detection, 
Analyze and Response combined to form a 
complete and dynamic safety cycle, which 
ensures the safety of information system under 
the safety guideline.  
Policy is the core of The P2DAR model in 
Fig 1. The security policy should be made in the 
company in order to carry out third-party 
128
logistics information management dynamic 
network system. The security policy provides 
guideline and supporting means in the 
information management, while protection is 
achieved by adopting some traditional static 
security means such as firewalls, encryption and 
user authentication. Detection is the foundation 
of the whole safety model and basis of dynamic 
analysis and response. It is also the powerful 
means to impose the security policy by 
continuously detecting and monitoring network 
and system and finding out the weakness and 
threat and at the same time it responds 
effectively and promptly through cycle feedback. 
It often detects the weakness of the system and 
external threat. Analyze is the most important 
link in the model, it further abstracts and 
analyzes findings of detection and distinguishes 
the most dangerous actions affecting system 
from the complex reports of findings and builds 
up the most –advanced warning model, provides 
the users the friendly analysis of findings, so we 
could quickly locate the existing problems 
occurred in the network and respond readily to 
the problems according to defense system 
previously worked out. Response plays an 
important role in the safety system and it is the 
most effective method to solve potential security 
problems. It must make correct response in case 
insecurity hole or incident occurs.   
B. Third-party logistics information safety 
detection model based on data mining 
As suggested in the P2DAR model in Fig 1, 
detection is the foundation of the whole safety 
model and basis of dynamic analysis and 
response. It is also the powerful means to 
impose the security policy by continuously 
detecting and monitoring network and system 
and finding out the weakness and threat and at 
the same time it responds effectively and 
promptly through cycle feedback. The 
application of data mining technique to 
detecting network and system of third-party 
logistics information model would 
automatically result in brief and accurate 
detecting model based on huge data being 
checked. The Information Detecting Model 
based on the association rules and Apriori 
algorithm is suggested in Fig 2.  
    In Fig 2, Packet Sniffer aims to collect data 
and it is only a simple interface to get 
information; while data preprocessing is 
responsible for transferring the network data 
and data connecting into the data format 
required by data mining, the steps includes 
further filtering, noise clearing up, the known 
attack detected by the third-party detection tools. 
Newdone Analyzer tries to find the new attack 
through association analysis and sequential 
analysis and sends abnormal behaviors to Rules 
Builder which extracts intrusive abnormal 
behavior patterns. Rule Bank is used to store the 
original intrusive behavior patterns and other 
intrusive behavior patterns which arise when 
Rules Builder is data mining. Rule Bank can 
also be used to data preprocessing. 
Announciator makes announcement to 
third-party logistics information management 
system administrator in human-computer 
interface when deviant analysis reports 
abnormal behaviors. 
 Data Mining and Its Applications 
Data mining means extracting hidden, 
unknown and potential useful information and 
knowledge from huge, incomplete, noisy, vague 
and random data. The major task of data mining 
is to adopt and develop some relevant theories, 
methods and tools to extract some useful and 
interesting knowledge and model by making full 
use of huge databases.    
A. Some concepts of Association Rule  
Let I={i1i2	im}be a set of items. Let 
D, the task-relevant data, be a set of database 
transactions where each transaction T is a set of 
items such that T ? I. Each transaction is 
associated with an identifier, called TID. Let A 
be a set of items. A transaction T is said to 
contain A if and only if A?T. An association 
rule is an implication of the form AB, where 
A? I,B? I, and 
? The rule A B 
holds in the transaction set D with support s, 
where s is the percentage of transactions in D 
that contain A? B(i.e., both A and B). This is 
taken to be the probability, P(A? B). The rule 
AB has confidence c in the transaction set D 
if c is the percentage of transaction in D 
containing A that also contain B. This is taken to 
be the conditional probability, P(B|A). that is, 
Support(AB)=P(A? B) 
Confidence(AB)=P(B|A). 
When support account and confidence 
account is equal or greater than their threshold 
limit value respectively, we can see A is equal or 
greater than B. These two values are named as 
min sup and min conf. If supportAB
min_sup and confidenceABmin_conf
association rule AB is the strong rule. If not, 
association rule AB is the weak rule.  
B. The process of association rule mining  
Association rule mining is to generate 
association rule which demands all support and 
confidence count exceeds min sup and min conf 
in itemsets D, that is, to satisfy supportAB
 min_sup and confidence  A  B  
129
min_conf. Association rule mining is a two-step 
process 
Find all frequent itemsets: By definition, 
each of these itemsets will occur at least as 
frequently as a pre-determined minimum 
support count.
Generate strong association rules from 
the frequent itemsets: By definition, these rules 
must satisfy minimum support and minimum 
confidence. 
C. The Apriori Algorithm 
Apriori is an influential algorithm for 
mining frequent itemsets for Boolean 
association rules. Apriori employs an iterative 
approach known as a level-wise search, where 
k-itemsets are used to explore(k+1)-itemsets. 
First, the set of frequent 1-itemsets is found. 
This set is denoted L1.L1 is used to find L2,the 
set of frequent 2-itemsets,which is used to find 
L3,and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets 
can be found. The finding of each Lk requires 
one full scan of the database. 
k-itemsets are the itemsets of {c1,c2,	,ck}. 
Lk refers to k-itemsets when support count is 
greater than minimum support count required by 
the users and it is also called frequent k- 
itemsets. Ck  refers to k-itemsets candidate 
composing candidate item sets, L . 
Apriori Algorithm could help to input 
accounting itemsets D and user specified 
minimum support count and minimum 
confidence account and output all association 
rule itemsets if support account and confidence 
account is greater than minimum support and 
minimum confidence respectively. Apriori 
Algorithm is shown as follows: 
L1=find_frequent_1-itemsets(D); 
for (k=2; Lk-? ; k++) { 
  Ck=apriori_gen(Lk-1,min_sup);

} 
return L=? kLk; 
Apriori Algorithm should first find out 
itemsets, L1 of frequent 1-itemsets and then L2 
of frequent 2-itemsets until some r-value 
appeared which make Lr empty. Then Apriori 
Algorithm will come to an end. In the cycle 
Lk-1is to generate candidate Ckthus to find out 
Lk. The Apriori_genprocedure generates the 
candidates and then uses the Apriori property to 
eliminate those having a subset that is not 
frequent. Itemsets in Ck  is to generate 
candidate itemsets which result in frequent 
itemsets. The final frequent itemsets Lk must be 
a subset of Ck.  
For each transaction, a subset function is 
used to find all subsets of the transaction that 
are candidates, and the count for each of these 
candidates is accumulated. Finally, all those 
candidates satisfying minimum support form the 
set of frequent itemsets, L. A procedure can then 
be called to generate association rules from the 
frequent itemsets 
For each frequent itemset l , generate all 
nonempty subsets of l . 
For every nonempty subsets of l , output 
the rule “s  ( l 7 s)”  if 
conf
scountport
lcountport
min_)(_sup
)(_sup ? , where 
support_count( l ) is the number of transactions 
containing the itemset l . 
As Apriori Algorithm doesn’t consider the 
specific aspects in data accounting and detection, 
it will result in a great number of useless rules 
or it is likely to miss some rule which 
infrequently appeared but with meaningful 
description of behavior patterns. So it is 
necessary to expand Apriori Algorithm by 
introducing some limiting characteristic 
attributes in the formation of rules. In 
association rule mining, characteristic attributes 
can restrict the formation process of candidate 
itemsets Ck so that it makes each itemset of Ck 
contain some characteristic attribute value.  
D. samples  
To process data packet into association 
record format and save it as text file, and 
separate the variants by space, suggested as 
follows:  
19281688188    tcp 25 exterpassive sf 
normal 
192816881865   tcp 25 exterpassive sf 
normal 
1928168818106  tcp 25 exter active sf 
normal 
We adopt association rule data mining to 
generate rules according to 250 items of 
association r information record satisfying both 
minimum support 8% and minimum confidence 
100%, it turns out a lot of less meaningful rules, 
which can not suggest any meaningful 
association between association values. If we 
detect the system according to these rules, it will 
mislead the decision making. So it is necessary 
to discard these meaningless rules, we can take 
130
the following procedures: 
 filter rules not including class type on 
the right side rules  
(2) and filter rule not including rules of TIP 
and Port on the left side rules.  
    Some satisfying rules are achieved by 
taking above steps, shown as follows:

information involves many factors, and there are 
also multi - methods to ensure the safety. The 
paper discusses the content and safety of 
third-party logistics information management 
and constructs a third-party logistics 
information safety detection model based on 
data mining which applies data mining 
technique to information detection and analyze 
in order to judge whether the information 
management model is attacked or not. The paper
