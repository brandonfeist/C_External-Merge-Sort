Abstract— The efficacy of a TCM medication derives from the 
herb-herb interaction in a formula. Although there are 
standard formulae, a practitioner will only pick a subset of 
formulas as templates and personalize them for the patients. It 
is not easy to determine the true interacting herbs to contribute 
to the effectiveness of a treatment. Association rule mining is 
an approach to find the co-occurrence of some items, however, 
it is not goal-oriented, and the generated results are very 
sensitive to the given parameters, i.e. support count. The aim of 
this paper is to introduce a new framework to systematically 
generate a set of combinations of interacting herbs that leads to 
good outcome. This algorithm was tested with a dataset of 
treatment of insomnia to understand the effectiveness of 
combination of herbs. Interesting and insightful results were 
noted and discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
While medications in western medicine often strive to 
avoid drug interaction, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
works in the opposite way by exploiting the useful 
interaction among multiple herbs in a formula (prescription). 
The efficacy of a TCM medication comes from the 
interaction of these herbs. Although there are standard 
formulae, a practitioner will only pick a subset of formulae 
as templates and personalize them for the patients. Since a 
doctor can add or remove or replace herbs in the template(s), 
the preparation of a prescription is a science as well as an art. 
As a result, it is not an easy task to determine the true 
interacting herbs that contribute to the efficacy of a 
treatment. Association rule mining (ARM) is a potential 
candidate to find the co-occurrence of items (which will be 
herbs in our case). However this method suffers from two 
aspects. This algorithm requires the definition of thresholds 
(e.g support count) prior to execution. The results are 
sensitive to these thresholds (as parameters). A different set 
of parameter values will give a very different result. Also, 
there is no scientific way to determine the correct threshold 
value; it is largely a trial-and-error exercise. A threshold with 
high value will severely reduce the number of results 
produced, whereas a small threshold will offer too many 
answers to be useful. Another issue is that ARM is not goal-
oriented. There is no proof or support that co-occurrence of 
herbs indicate their interaction, hence, it cannot help a person 
with a specific question.  
The aim of this work is to propose complementarity as a 
surrogate of herbs interaction. A new algorithm is introduced 
to discover all the possible sets of interacting herbs, and it 
does not rely on any threshold value (parameter-free). 
Related work will be described in Section 2, while Section 3 
gives an overview of our proposal method. An insomnia 
dataset will be described in Section 4. Experimental results 
will be presented in Section 5. Section 6 is the discussion.  
Conclusion and future work can be found in Section 7. 
II. RELATED WORK
Association rule mining is considered to be the 
cornerstone of data mining research. The objective of this 
2010 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops
978-1-4244-8302-0/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 722
technique is to find dependencies between different variables 
(called items) in a large database. Unlike a standard 
statistical approach to test for correlation between variables, 
association rule mining casts the problem as a search for 
dependencies (called association rules). Support and 
confidence are two measurements to guide the search 
process. The earlier research in association rule mining has 
focused on algorithms for discovery [1] and more recently on 
pruning [2].  
However, it is also well known that the standard 
measures of support and confidence are not objective enough 
for generating rules (need to rewrite). To improve 
objectivity, one approach is based on some interestingness 
measures to guide the selection process. Several other 
statistical measures of interestingness have been proposed, 
and [3] provided an extensive analysis of the properties of 
the different measures. Other approaches have also been 
proposed to determine the interestingness of a set of frequent 
itemsets using background knowledge in the form of prior 
beliefs of the user [4]. There are several advantages of using 
interestingness measures. One advantage is to allow users to 
compare rules objectively. Another one is the provision of 
statistical significance, e.g. Brin [12] suggested using a Chi 
Squared statistic that takes advantage of the upward closure 
property. Essentially this means the statistic is strictly 
increasing with the itemset size and the number of variables. 
As [5] point out their approach has the flaw that this is not 
true with increasing item set size as the degrees of freedom 
are not constant.  
One other way to address the interaction is to create a 
network [10] from the prescriptions and select important 
herbs for further analysis. The authors applied MDR to the 
reduced feature set to find the nonlinear relationship among 
the herbs and to generate the sets of herbs that are useful.. 
III. COMPLEMENTARITY & SUPERMODULAR FUNCTION
Many existing works consider interaction as additive 
interaction, while we want to pursue interaction that is more 
than additive. If we are using two variables as an example, 
then our aim is to identify those factors have the property of 
f (ab) ? f (a) + f (b) 
where ab indicates the interaction effect of two factors. 
The concept of complementarities is a surrogate for 
interaction. It offers a useful perspective to study the 
complex relationships between inter-related variables. This 
concept was first introduced by Edgeworth in which he 
defined factors as complements if doing (more of) any one of 
them increases the returns to doing (more of) the others. The 
notion of complementarity requires only that some ordering 
of the objects under consideration is in place. This 
observation has led to the actual formalization of the concept 
in the mathematical theory of lattices, which is the basis for 
the development of monotone optimization problems 
pioneered by Donald Topkis [6]. By drawing on lattice 
theory and supermodularity, Milgrom and Roberts [8, 9] 
proposed the “web of complementarities” theory which 
marked an important new direction for research in the 
economics research discipline. They argued that some of the 
organizational activities and practices are mutually 
complementary and so tend to be adopted together, with each 
enhancing the contribution of the other. The 
“supermodularity” of a function will be used to identify the 
complementarities [6]. Supermodularity dictates that the sum 
of the increases in the value of a function. If 
complementarities among activities exist, then the gains from 
increasing every feature are larger than the sum of the 
individual increases. In other words, a test for 
complementarities must consider performance data on some 
function that is hypothesized to be supermodular. 
Suppose there are two herbs H1 and H2. Each herb can 
be used in a formula (H1=1) or not (H1=0) and (H2=1) or 
not (H2=0). The function f(H1,H2) is supermodular and H1 
and H2 are complements only if: f(1,1) + f(0,0) ? f(1,0) + 
f(0,1) This concept has also been used in conjunction with 
contingency and configuration [9]. This definition can be 
scaled up for multiple variable complementarities. In a more 
general way, when a vector of numbers in k-dimension, a 
function of f: Rk ? R is said to be supermodular if 
 f (x  y) + f (x  y) ? f (x) + f (y) (1) 
 x, y  Rk, where (x  y) denotes the component-wise 
maximum and (x  y) the component-wise minimum of x 
and y. In other words, the heuristic is to measure the 
marginal gain over the baseline and the separate effect due to 
each individual variable. Figure 1 is the pseudo code which 
incrementally finds all the interactionsets, i.e. sets of 
interacting variables. Each interactionsets must meet two 
conditions: the necessary and sufficient conditions.  
 It will not be possible to calculate the supermodular 
value of a pattern (herbs) if the dataset does not contain all 
the possible combinations of the pattern. The existence of all 
the permutations is the necessary condition which is related 
to lines 11-15 in the algorithm (Figure 1). Once the 
necessary condition is satisfied, a pattern can go through the 
sufficient condition testing by calculating its supermodular 
value (lines 16-22). A pattern is considered complementary 
(or interacting) when a positive value is derived.. 
IV. DATASET
Insomnia is a “nightmare” to many people. It refers to the 
poor quality of sleep or insufficient sleep duration, it can 
lead to adverse daytime consequences. Studies have shown 
that rates of insomnia with associated daytime dysfunction in 
attendees of general medical practices range from 10% to as 
high as 34% [13]. Therefore, insomnia is a popular, 
important and vital disorder that needs to be addressed. 
We have selected and labeled 460 insomnia outpatient 
encounters from a TCM hospital in Beijing. The outcome of 
each encounter was annotated by TCM clinical experts who 
went through the changes of the insomnia-related variables 
over consecutive visits; these include the sleep time per day, 
sleep quality and difficulty in falling asleep. The outcomes 
are then classified into two categories: good and bad. When a 
treatment was effective, which means that if the patient 
recovered completely or partly from insomnia in the next 
723
encounter, then the prescription of the current encounter 
would be categorized as ‘good’; otherwise, the herb 
prescription would be categorized as ‘bad’. 
After labeling these 460 outpatient encounters, there are 
68 encounters with bad outcomes in this dataset; in other 
words, it is an imbalanced dataset. The average good 
outcome rate (GOR) of the whole data set is 
392/460=85.21%. There are 261 distinct herbs in the dataset 
and there are on average 14 herbs in a formula. In current 
stage, we ignored the dosage of each herb but only recorded 
whether an herb is used, i.e. it is represented in binary 
format. Each encounter has an entry for each herb, while the 
zeros and ones indicate the herbs actually prescribed in the 
current formula.

V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
We prepared to run three different experiments by using 
different functions to calculate the supermodularity. The 
function in the first experiment was to count the occurrence 
of good outcome. The second one was similar to the first 
one, except we included an additional constraint of 
f(11)>f(00) in addition to Eq.1 to ensure the combined effect 
has to be better than the baseline effect (when none of the 
herbs being applied). In the third experiment, instead of 
simply using count, we used a ratio to measure the relative 
success, which is  
	 

	 
 1_
1_


patternoutcomebad
patternoutcomegood
Also, 1 is added to both the numerator and denominator 
to overcome the potential problem of having zero 
occurrence of bad_outcome of the pattern. 
Experiment 1. There were 3,724 2-way interactionsets 
obtained for the necessary condition and 3,513 of them 
finally satisfied the sufficient condition. Table 1 shows the 
top 5 two-way interactionsets. The program further explored 
the three-way interactionsets and it has generated 23,743 
candidates (meeting the necessary conditions) with 3,620 
interactionset that qualified the sufficient condition to 
indicate true interaction.  
Experiment 2. It had the same number of 3,827 2-way 
interactionsets obtained for the necessary condition but, this 
time, there was only one that finally satisfied the sufficient 
condition, which was <VAR33, VAR237> (<??,????
>). For 3-way interaction, it finally came to the following 
two patterns: 
 <VAR33,VAR200,VAR237> 
 <VAR33,VAR236,VAR237> 
which corresponds to <Indian bread, common 
anemarrhena rhizome, stir-frying spine date seed> (<??,
??, ????>) and <Indian bread, fresh liquorice root, 
stir-frying spine date seed> (<??,???,????>).

Experiment 3. Using the ratio approach, the number of 2-
way interactionsets, 546 pairs satisfy both the necessary and 
sufficient conditions. Table 2 shows the top 10 two-way 
interactionsets. In the search for the three-way 
interactionsets, 49 3-way combinations are found. 
VI. DISCUSSION
The numbers of 2-interactionsets and 3-interaction-sets 
are too many to be useful in Experiment 1. Though these 
3000-odd interactionsets qualified the basic super-modularity 
requirements, the top 5 pairs did not seem to be anywhere 
specific to insomnia when we examined each of them 
individually from Table 1. Hence, if we used the basic 
724
supermodular function as a criterion, the results were not 
encouraging. One possible reason for this disappointing 
observation may due to the fact that the effectiveness of f(11) 
was far inferior to the baseline, f(00). 
As a result, an extra condition was introduced to ensure 
f(11) must have a better performance than f(00). The 
inclusion of this new criterion has dropped the number of 
interactionsets to just one pattern of 2-way interaction and 
two for the 3-way interaction. The results found were all 
relevant herbs used for tranquillization in the Suanzaoren 
Tang (????). 
The resulting single pair and two triplet in Experiment 3 
are the herbs used in Suanzaoren Tang. In other words, the 
process rediscovered the core herbs in a well known formula. 
The results in Table 2 from Experiment 3 were interesting 
though some of them are out specifically used to address 
insomnia. For example, according to the TCM doctor, the 
first pair of <Chinese date, fresh ginger> has the function to 
harmonize the qi and blood, yingfen and weifen, spleen and 
stomach, but it is mainly used as an assistant rather than as 
master herbs. The second and third pairs are not typical 
relevant to insomnia as well. The pair-5,6 and 10 are typical 
herb-pairs for Liuwei Dihuang Pill (?????). The spline 
date in pair-4 and -7 is for nourishing the heart and 
tranquillization, while the purpose of the second herb in both 
cases is to nourish spleen and kidney yin. Pair-8 and -9 are 
considered interesting discovery in this list. For example, 
cassia bark in the 9th pair, traditionally teams up with golden 
thread in Jiaotai Wan (???), has the purpose of restoring 
normal coordination between heart and kidney. Its current 
pairing up with Indian bread which can strengthen the 
spleen, eliminate the dampness and tranquillization has 
clinical implication.

An interesting observation from these experiments is that 
using the typical occurrence count can lead the popular and 
known herb combination, while the use of ratio approach 
does not always have good results, but it has led to some 
surprising (and potentially useful) results. The question is: 
whether the existing herb-set theory has already been so well 
established that we modeled the computational approach to 
re-confirm the TCM theory, or we should explore new 
functions to enable the discovery of seemingly uninspiring 
herbs combination. 
VII. CONCLUSION
To identify the herbs that truly interact in a formula is an 
important research in TCM. This paper has proposed the use 
of complementarity to explain the interaction effect, which is 
indicated by the value of a supermodular function. A new 
parameter-free algorithm was designed to incrementally 
search for all the herbs combination. The algorithm was 
applied to a clinical dataset on insomnia treatment from a 
Beijing TCM hospital. Generated results were commented 
by TCM practitioners. It is encouraging that interesting and 
new discoveries were found. Having said that the algorithm 
is free from the worry of determining the parameter values, it 
is not completely trouble-free; another problem has shown 
up. Three different functions were used in our experiments 
and different results were reported. Hence, one of the future 
works is to identify the most appropriate function to be used 
in the TCM context. Another future direction is to explore if 
the herb-herb interaction is stronger under existence of other 
herbs, i.e. to look for computational approach to support the 
theory of master-deputy-assistant-envoy (????) [11]. It 
also became obvious from the discussion with the TCM 
doctors that herb-herb interaction without any associated 
knowledge on symptoms and/or syndromes is a major 
handicap. The search for symptom-herb is also an important 
direction. Lastly, unlike ARM that uses anti-monotonic 
property to do the pruning, the computation performance of 
the new algorithm is a worthwhile direction to proceed, i.e. 
parallel or cloud computing.
