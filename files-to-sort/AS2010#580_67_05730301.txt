A Proposal to Enhance Cross-marketing via Social 
Networks by Modelling and Analyzing Market 
Basket like Patterns across Social Network Groups 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abstract--The ability to create groups has for long been one of 
the features of interest for the users across the social networks. 
Groups allow users (account holders) to join them, be a fan-
follower of them, etc. In addition, there have been provisions for 
the account holder to also be a part of multiple groups as a 
member. The primary goal of our research is to analyze patterns 
within group membership. Essentially, we will be proposing a 
model based on market basket analysis over a subset of the social 
network groups and then derive a set of associative mining rules 
amongst these networks. The information mined may provide 
interesting insights for cross-marketing purposes. For instance, 
using this technique an organization Ox could find that the 
buyers of their product x tend to be socially fans or members of 
groups with the subtype Y or even, perhaps, more specifically 
with another organization Oy that sell a product y. Using such 
data, the organizations may then try to leverage these findings to 
build a co-opetative (Co-operation + Competition), profitable 
synergy and might also give them insights to determine which 
products of Oy may be impacted if the store discontinues selling 
the product x or vice-versa. The aim of this paper is to bring in a 
new high-level dimension to the social network analysis area by 
imbibing the concepts of Market Basket and then try to provide a 
basic feasibility criterion for the entire approach by simple 
simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK 
In the recent past, social networks and Social Network 
Analysis (SNA) have been deemed as some of the most critical 
components of computer supported social interactions, serving 
the business analysts and strategist with a whole new method 
of capturing customer mindset, market trends, etc. Content 
generated in social networking environments would include 
discussion threads across social network groups, micro-blog 
sharing, social status messages, and any other content posted 
by users. This accumulated content can be considered as an 
asset that has value, which can be tapped through the right 
types of analyses. This asset has potential value to both owners 
of the sites as well as the organizations whose products and 
services are being discussed. It presents significant 
implications for enterprises wanting to leverage social 
networks to draw insights and inferences on user participation 
and preferences expressed in networks. 
While the SNA trends are creating ripples in the 
technological front and Web 2.0 arena, there has been quite a 
wide spread interest in it from the management front as well. It 
shows considerable promise for helping analysts to handle a 
number of classic situations like understanding the myriad 
relationships that can either facilitate or impede information 
transmission, diffusion and propagation as explained by 
Blondel et al in [3] through the analysis of a social network 
diagram—a map of individuals and the social ties that link 
them together. Apart from this, it would also help them to 
come up with answers to some strategic questions like - How is 
the information about a particular product/gadget, etc that was 
developed or manufactured by the organization flowing and 
propagating outside of the organization? What are the kinds of 
sentiments that are being showered upon this product? [5] Is 
there an individual within this social graph who could help the 
organization in propagating the news about this product? [5] 
Are there some subgroups that are not sharing what they know 
as effectively as they should? 
In this paper, our key research hovers over modeling the use 
of aspects like Market-Basket Analysis [2] by clubbing it with 
Social Network Groups to build association rules and rule 
metrics to extract a tripartite relationship between products, 
organizations and individuals and in parallel, extract a set of 
associative mining rules from them.  
II. PROPOSED  MODEL 
The primary objective of the proposed model is to analyze 
patterns within group membership. Essentially, we propose to 
perform a market basket analysis on a subset of social 
networks’ groups. For the purpose of analysis, the ?transaction 
table? is to be defined as a single transaction per person, with 
the ?items? being the groups to which that person belongs. 
With this in mind, let us now define some basic definitions 
and notations involved in the model.  
A. Formal Model 
Definition 1: A Social Network Group is a database of 
pages connected by elementary links that provide a single non-
decomposable content of a group in the form of group-pages. 
These group-pages aren’t run by individuals, so they don’t 
have a user status and don’t send updates to other users’ feeds. 
Instead, they import streams of related, public content from 
user status messages.  
We now revamp this entire notion of group-pages, groups 
and links into a graph based model as follows.

 Definition 2: We have a directed graph G = (N, E) that 
consists of a set of nodes, N, which can be of two types – 
either a group or a user and E, is the set of edges or arcs. A 
node Ku ? N is an entity that corresponds to a group-page K of 
the user u (u could also be interchangeably addressed as a 
user-page). An arc is an ordered pair (?u, ?v) ? E and it 
corresponds to a link and the element ?, ? refers to a group-
page and u, v refers to user-pages. In this case u and v can be 
identical or can be different. In addition the graph is weighted 
and the weight of an edge expresses the number of users that 
have established a link including the one under consideration, 
that are associated with a given group and moreover, the graph 
G need not necessarily be connected. 
Now, to capture the user preference among the groups we 
introduce the concept of an association rule, which could be 
of the form Xx ? Yx with a certain probability ??? (x). This 
probability is called as the confidence of the association rule 
and is read as the probability of a user x who is associated with 
a group X to also be associated with a group Y. 
Definition 3: A Market Basket association rule between a 
user and a group is an expression of the form Xx ? Yx , where 
X, Y ? N which form an ordered pair (Xu, Yu) ? E  ?u,v with a 
confidence ??? . This confidence represents the probability that 
a user would be a part of a group Y given that he or she is 
already a member of group X. (.i.e with X as the source and Y 
as the destination. It would be good to note that ??? ? ???  ). 
 Mathematically, if  |(?, ?)| denotes the number of users 
who are a member of group X and Y, with X as the source and 
? ?  ? ,? ??}|(?, ?)|  represents the number of users who are a 
member of group X and any other group other than group Y. 
Then, the confidence CXY between X and Y is given by the 
equation  ??? =
|(X,Y)|
? ?  ? ,? ??}|(? ,?)|
 . 
Definition 4: Now that we have defined the notion and 
concept of confidence between the groups, we introduce the 
concept of the relevance of these confidences. Basically, the 
motivation behind introducing this is to validate the level of 
confidence, and because of the fact that a rule that holds a 
respectable degree of interest, if and only if, the corresponding 
link is traversed a significant number of times relative to the 
average. This is called the support of the association rule.  
Now, we define that a support of the an association rule 
(? ? ?) is ??? , if and only if ???  is the number of times the 
groups X and Y were associated  directly through a link, over 
the average of times all the links in the graph were traversed. 
Thus,  ??? =  
|(X,Y)|
 
 ? ?  ?? , ??+1 ??}
 ? ,?  
|? |
  where, |E| is the number of 
arcs in E. The value of ???  usually ranges around 1 and if the 
value of  ??? > 1, it implies that the support for the 
association-rule is greater than the average and vice-versa.  
B. Methods for Mining Association Rules 
While the previous sections described the motivation behind 
using the Market Basket Analysis kind of a concept over the 
social network groups, this section concentrates on the 
different types of methods that are available to apply 
association analysis to data. 
i. Algorithms for Social Network Market Basket Analysis 
In the recent past, powerful search engines have been 
developed to aid in locating unfamiliar documents by 
category, contents or subject. It is still not feasible to extract in 
full, the meaning of an HTML document. However, more 
recently, intelligent software agents have been developed 
which extract semantic features from the words or structure of 
an HTML document. These extracted features are then 
employed to classify and categorize the documents.  
   On the other hand, we are not concentrating in obtaining the 
entire semantics of the HTML data, but, concentrating more 
on mere classification and categorization of the documents. 
   There are a number of methods and techniques that are 
proposed in this space of social network classification like the 
ones in [7, 8]. The general tendency and research pattern 
amongst them has been that the technique of clustering has 
been provably the simpler and more intuitive method, 
especially for grouping over social networks. 
    The results of such a clustering mechanism could then be 
used to automatically formulate queries and search for other 
similar profiles that imitate a particular class of profiles, 
which is exactly what is required for execution of a Market 
Basket Analysis kind of a scenario. 
More intuitively, we could see that for an analysis like 
Market Basket, our key areas of concentration are on grouping 
based on a binary matrix (as explained earlier). Thus, the key 
parameters for clustering would be more towards using the 
notion of “Yes-Yes”, “Yes-No”, “No-Yes” and “No-No” kind 
of value groupings to form the clusters. 
So essentially, from a high level perspective – to perform a 
Market Basket Analysis, we must satisfy the following 
requirements. We also explain how we plan to satisfy this 
requirement in our paper. 
(a) First requirement is an approach for analyzing market 
basket data, the discovery and interpretation of 
association rules [2]. 
In this paper, we perform the association mining and 
build the association rules using the a priori algorithm 
that is described in detail by Agarwal et al in [1]. 
(b) The second requirement is to combat the explosion of 
uninteresting rules. That means we need to calculate 
interestingness measures [9] on the rules. These 
measures can then be used to either rank the rules by 
importance (or present a sorted list to the user) or as an 
additional pruning criterion. How exactly interestingness 
is determined varies by measure, but many existing 
measures take the approach that interestingness is 
“deviation from independence.” 
 For this we use the existing and provably good methods 
involving the calculation of measures like confidence, 
support and interestingness as explained in the earlier 
sections.  
(c) Thirdly, we need to devise a mechanism to organize 
observed data into meaningful structures, that is, to 
develop taxonomies.  In other words we need to conduct 
cluster analysis to sort objects into groups in a way that 
 the degree of association between two objects is maximal 
if they belong to the same group and minimal otherwise. 
 For this we use the density based clustering mechanisms, 
commonly known as DBSCAN that has been explained 
in detail by Sander et al in [10].  
(d) Finally, we need to analyze the different patterns within 
the clusters from a macro scale and build inferences 
from them. 
The patterns might include analyses like identifying the 
most influential nodes of a category type X which are a 
part of a cluster K which could play a crucial role in 
maximizing the information diffusion and spread across 
the cluster elements, which would be typically a user 
profile. We use tools like Weka  
[www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/] and Rapid Miner 
[rapid-i.com/] for this task. 
III. SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS 
A. Test bed and Data set Information. 
The test bed for the simulations and experiments consisted of 
a large data set of 19,359 transactions or users bearing 
UserIDs and each userID in-turn have a number of itemsets 
(13 to be precise). In this study we used data from Facebook 
[www.facebook.com].  The data was collected from a sample 
representative of the user population (slightly over-sampling 
younger age groups to reflect the active audience).   
The structure of the dataset was scraped from Facebook 
using the facebook-java-api and comprises a set of users, 
their social graph information in terms of their unique ID, as 
well as information about the group that they belong to, 
spanning over a set of major group types like Business, 
Entertainment, Internet & Technology, Music, Organizations, 
Sports and Student.  
We then adopt an alternative, empirical approach to 
determine the inter-relationships between the users’ social 
pursuits and employ Market Basket Analysis over this data.  
This allows us to identify the inter-relationships between the 
people who are interested in Business, Entertainment, Internet 
& Technology, Music, Organizations, Sports and Student from 
the Facebook social network.  
To ease interpretation, we decided to model the results based 
on a kind of conditional independence graphs. A conditional 
independence graph is one in which we have four possible 
clusters each representing the Yes-Yes, Yes-No, No-Yes and 
No-No clusters as shown in the Figure 1. The figure shows the 
clusters for a few key associations in a two dimensional 
format between Business and Internet & Technologies. The 
Yes-Yes cluster indicates the cluster of users whose interest 
lies in Business and Internet Technologies, the cluster Yes-No 
indicates the cluster of users who are interested in Business 
but not in Internet Technologies, similarly No-Yes and No-No 
clusters also indicate the respective user preferences. 
B. Experiments and Data Analytics 
The experiments and data analytics were conducted on the 
data sets that were mentioned above. The entire analysis was 
conducted to verify the proposed model and lay down a good 
platform for future research. As a simple proof of concept we 
have proposed a simple simulation that was conducted using  
Weka data mining tool using the DBSCAN cluster algorithm 
and the a priori associative mining algorithm which were pre-
built in Weka.  
The results of the clusters are as shown in the graphs below- 
Figures 1 and 2 depict a two dimensional analysis, where as 
Figure 3 depicts a three dimensional analysis of data. The 
explanations of the figures and the derived inferences are 
provided below the respective figures. 
Fig 1 shows a 2 dimensional correlation across a Yes-Yes, 
Yes-No, No-Yes and No-No clusters. The annotations in the 
figure depict the state each cluster denotes. It was observed 
that the Yes-Yes cluster had the smallest support and the No-
No had the largest support. 
 
 
Fig 1: A 2D Cluster Analysis of Internet v/s Business 
 
From this we could infer that if an individual is 
concentrating in leveraging his/her business that is internet 
viral based, then probably the number of potential influencers 
or information propagators (the one’s in the Yes-Yes cluster) is 
extremely less when compared to information receivers (The 
ones in the Yes-No, No-Yes and No-No clusters) or if we are 
looking at figure 2, which deals with the Organization versus 
Business clustering we could see that the support and 
confidence of the Yes-Yes association is moderate and greater 
than the support and confidence of Yes-No and No-No clusters. 
 From this we could infer that if an individual is 
concentrating in leveraging his/her Organizational Business, 
then probably the number of potential influencers or 
information propagators (the one’s in the Yes-Yes cluster) is 
not very less when compared to information receivers (The 
ones in the Yes-No, No-Yes and No-No clusters). 
 
Fig 2: A 2D Cluster Analysis of Organization v/s 
Business 
 
Till now we have been observing and analyzing the clusters 
 in a purely 2 dimensional perspective viz. in a 2 parameter 
world of Market Basket Analysis. However, people like Tang 
et al in [11] have shown that we tend to get a better 
perspective when the social world is viewed as a triadic 
component than just a bi-partite component. 
So, the next model of analysis shows us the possibility of 
dealing and deriving inferences from a 3 dimensional clusters. 
In the 3 dimensional clusters, in addition to the existing 
parameters of 2 dimensional clusters, there will also be 
another parameter that would be included. This would enable 
us to derive more profound inferences of the form ?What is 
the support and confidence of finding a potential positive 
influencer of type X inside a Market Basket Cluster between 
two other types of itemset in a social media transaction (i.e. a 
transaction that is build for Market Basket Analysis over 
social media)?. 
The figure 3 depicts this kind of analysis that was made on 
the dataset.  
 
 
Fig 3: A 3D Cluster Analysis of Internet v/s Business 
and Entertainment 
It shows a 3 dimensional correlation across a Yes-Yes, Yes-
No, No-Yes and No-No clusters between Internet and Business 
Groups with Entertainment Group as the third dimension. The 
clusters are depicted in such a way that the clusters are a part 
of the Market Basket of Internet versus Business analysis and 
the colored elements in the cluster depict the presence or 
absence of the third parameter (or itemset); the red colored 
items indicate that they are a part of the Entertainment group 
and blue colored items indicate that they are ?not a part? of the 
Entertainment group. 
Through the cluster analysis, it was seen that the No-Yes, 
No-No and the Yes-Yes cluster had a high support for 
Entertainment and the Yes-No cluster had a low support for 
Entertainment. 
One possible inference that we could derive from such an 
analysis is that we could exploit the possibility of using the 
users as potential influencers in places of good or high 
internet and business interest groups, which actually seems 
very much intuitive – the very essence of this study was to 
bring out more and more inferences that usually seem non-
intuitive and non-obvious. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have addressed a practical application of 
Market Basket Analysis over Social Network Groups by 
formally introducing a new and efficient paradigm for cross 
marketing in Social Networks. This problem is of practical 
interest, and has been extensively researched by the data 
mining community in the last six years. Many researchers 
have devoted much time and energy to discover clever and 
fast algorithms. But, most common application of Market 
Basket Analysis has been deeply concentrated in retail 
business chain and there has been no work at all in using this 
over the Social Media, more so, with the social network 
groups. 
Our proposal of this sort of modeling did not depend on 
new tricks. Instead, it is carried out using a sequence of 
standard calculation techniques such as frequent pattern 
mining, clustering and support, confidence and interestingness 
filters. But, we believe that this way of modeling Market 
Baskets across social groups could be efficiently and 
effectively used to implement and increase cross selling and 
cross marketing across social media.  
This research conducted by us is very significant in this way 
that, not only was it for verifying the feasibility of the 
approach on practical platform, but also for building a much 
needed paradigm that is necessary to bridge the gap between 
transactional-real world and social media markets.  
On the other hand, this is also a kind of an introductory 
proof of concept seminal work that was conducted to help 
inculcate a new paradigm of thoughts into the SNA arena; we 
are currently working across multiple social networks and 
larger datasets to try and bring out better analysis and 
associations between the user-group pairs across the social 
networks.
