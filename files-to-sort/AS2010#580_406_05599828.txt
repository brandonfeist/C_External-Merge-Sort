Abstract
Association mining aims to ?nd valid correlations
among data attributes, and has been widely applied
to many areas of data analysis. In this paper we
present a semantic network based association analy-
sis model including three spreading activation meth-
ods, and apply this model to assess the quality of
a dataset, and generate semantically valid new hy-
potheses for further investigation. We evaluate our
approach on a real public health dataset, the Heart-
felt study, and the experiment shows promising re-
sults.

1 Introduction
Association rule mining [1] has been widely applied
to numerous domains, such as analysis of market-
basket datasets, text mining, and disease diagnosis.
Association rules whose support and con?dence are
above user-speci?ed thresholds are considered statis-
tically signi?cant and presented to end-users. While
these objective measures are e?ective to reduce rule
redundancy, incorporation of subjective and domain-
speci?c knowledge is still a critical challenge for asso-
ciation analysis, and these knowledge should be rep-
resented in a more structured way to maximize its
usage. Hence, we choose semantic network to rep-
resent knowledge for association analysis. Seman-
tic network has been implemented in many knowl-
edge bases. Concepts and ideas in the human brain
have been shown to be semantically linked, which
motivates the modern research of semantic network
[13]. A semantic network represents knowledge as
a directed graph, where vertices represent concepts
and edges represent semantic relations between the
concepts. Figure 1 shows a sample semantic net-
work whose vertices represent concepts and edges are
labeled with names of relations. Concepts are or-
ganized into a hierarchical structure by is-a edges,
and other edges show causal relations, e.g., observ-
able entity diagnose disease or syndrome, stressed is
a mental process, diseases can be result of mental
process. Comparing with other knowledge represen-
tation models, a semantic network has the following
advantages:
1. Easy to use. A user needs little training or com-
puter background to build semantic networks.
Semantic networks are easy to understand and
its explanation is usually straightforward.
2. Flexible, incremental, and easy to update.
Building a semantic network does not require a
user to have a complete or perfect understand-
ing at the beginning. Instead, the building pro-
cessing can be incremental, and knowledge can

be updated locally as a user gets more familiar
with a domain.
3. Generative. A semantic network is not a mere
static structure, instead it has a vertex-?ring
mechanism called spreading activation. Firing or
activation of a vertex sends activation to its se-
mantically connected neighbor vertices. Spread-
ing activation only accesses local neighbor ver-
tices, so its time complexity does not grow with
the size of the network.
In this paper we will discuss a semantic network-
based association analysis model. With this model
we will provide the following analysis techniques:
1. Hypothesis generation. New hypotheses are gen-
erated through generalization and inference from
the association rule set, and give end-users direc-
tions for further investigation.
2. Data quality assessment. A dataset is just an
imperfect and incomplete re?ection of a real-
world object or scenario. By analyzing associ-
ation rules we can assess the quality of original
dataset.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we
discuss a knowledge model to represent domain and
user knowledge. We present three spreading activa-
tion methods in 3. In Sections 4 and 5 we discuss how
to assess data quality and generate hypothesis based
on association mining. We evaluate our method in
Section 6 using a real-world public health dataset.
Related work is discussed in Section 7. We conclude
in Section 8.
2 Association Modeling with a
Semantic Network
We de?ne a semantic network SN for association rule
analysis as a directed graph, SN = (V,A,H, S, T ) [3],
• V is a set of vertices that denote the attributes
in the dataset and relevant concepts from its do-
main, V = {v1, v2, · · · , vk};
• A is a set of association edges connecting mul-
tiple vertices, A = {(v1, v2, · · · , vn, u)|vi, u ?
V, (i = 1, · · · , n)}. An association edge
v1, v2, · · · , vn ? u denotes an association among
attributes, with v1, v2, · · · , vn as the antecedent
part of an association (also called the body),
and u as the consequent part (also called the
head). For example, the association “blood ves-
sel feature, heart rate ? hypertensive diseases”
is shown in Figure 1, which involves three ver-
tices. Semantically an association edge means
“associated-with”. In practice an edge often can
be labeled with more speci?c relations, such as
“result-of”, “indicate”, etc. If we know what val-
ues of these attributes take, an association edge
can represent one or multiple association rules,
v1 = a1, v2 = a2, · · · , vn = an ? u = a;
• H is a set of is-a edges connecting two vertices,
H = {(v, u)|v, u ? V }. An edge v is-a u de-
notes a subclass-superclass relation, with v as
the child, and u as the parent;
• S is a label set, S = {KNOWN,BASIC}. An
association edge in A can be label with KNOWN,
BASIC, or both.
KNOWN labels are speci?ed by end-users. A
KNOWN association edge means that this asso-
ciation is already known by the user.
A BASIC edge can be obtained from a user
or other knowledge sources. BASIC association
edges represent highly con?dent principles about
a domain, e.g., “observable entity indicates clini-
cal ?nding”. textitBASIC edges are used to iden-
tify semantically invalid hypothesis generated in
Section 4.
• T is a set of attribute-value pairs, and T = {vi =
ai|vi ? V }. These pairs are provided by users as
not interesting or trivial instances. For example,
in public health domain, “Obesity = No” is usu-
ally not interesting, but “Hypertension = Yes”
is interesting.
Creation of such a semantic network can be highly
automated if there exist electronic domain knowledge

sources. Figure 1 shows a fragment of semantic net-
work built for our case study. The vertices are med-
ical concepts from a dataset. These concepts are
connected with associated-with and causal relations
shown as ? and is-a shown as ? (dashed line if its
label is KNOWN, solid line if its label is BASIC ).
3 Spreading Activation Meth-
ods
To create a high-quality semantic network, often we
have to acquire many association edges and their
labels from end-users and other knowledge sources.
However, the hierarchical design of our semantic net-
work can greatly lighten the burden of knowledge ac-
quisition, and many associations can be generated
by spreading activation, and a user does not have to
specify every association explicitly as in other exist-
ing methods. Here are the three spreading activation
methods:
1. v1 ? u1 ? u1 ? u2 |= v1 ? u2
Generally associations are transitive.
2. v1 is-a v2 ? v2 ? u |= v1 ? u
The antecedent part of a rule can be specialized,
which is called deduction in logic. For exam-
ple, Tweety is-a bird ? bird ? ?y |= Tweety ?
?y. 1 With this method, all the associations be-
tween v2’s children and u can be replaced by a
single association v2 ? u. For example, we do
not have to specify, heart rate ? clinical ?nding,
mean artery pressure ? clinical ?nding, · · ·, in-
stead, one association observable entity ? clini-
cal ?nding will be su?cient.
3. u1 is-a u2 ? v ? u1 |= v ? u2
The consequent part of a rule can be generalized,
e.g., ?y is-a move ? bird ? ?y |= bird ? move.
With this method, all the associations between v
and u1’s parents can be replaced by a single asso-
ciation v ? u1. For example, we do not have to

which is an interesting topic in modal logic.
specify, observable entity ? blood vessel ?nding,
observable entity ? arterial ?nding, · · ·, instead,
one association observable entity ? hypertensive
diseases will be su?cient.
4 Hypothesis Generation
Generating high-quality new hypotheses is very im-
portant for knowledge discovery in scienti?c study.
With concepts semantically organized and correlated
in a semantic network, the intuition for generating
hypotheses is that if two concepts are associated,
maybe their semantically connected neighbors (chil-
dren and siblings) are also associated. We have the
following hypothesis generation methods,
Hypothesis Generation Method 1:
{v’s child} ? u |= v ? u
This is called induction in logic. If v’s child is as-
sociated with u, likely v is also associate with u. In-
duction is useful when the direct observation of v is
di?cult or impossible when v is an abstract concept.
Hypothesis Generation Method 2:
{v’s sibling} ? u |= v ? u
Analogy is another technique used by human be-
ings to generate hypotheses.
If these generated hypotheses already exist in the
rule set, they will be discarded, and only new hy-
potheses are kept. Hypotheses are not necessarily
facts, but they are more likely to be true than ran-
dom guess, and they provide directions for further
investigation. Additional constraints can reduce the
number of hypotheses and keep only highly plausible
ones, e.g., using only immediate children and siblings.
5 Data Quality Assessment
A dataset is just a sampling of a real-world object or
scenario at di?erent spatial and temporal points or
intervals. Naturally we want to assess the quality of
a dataset, that is, how precisely they re?ect reality.
Data quality is a multi-dimensional concept includ-
ing completeness, appropriate amount, amount of
4
BB
errors/missing values, objectivity, believability [12].
Among these properties, what directly a?ect the
quality of association rules are:
1. whether the amount of collected data is appro-
priate.
If the collected data is not enough to approxi-
mate the “true” scenario precisely, we will get
many wrong or coincident rules (false negative).
2. whether the set of data attributes is semantically
coherent.
An association rule is valid only if the attributes
in the rule are semantically relevant. Rules gen-
erated by semantically isolated attributes will
likely be coincident instead of valid. A poorly de-
signed experiment with many isolated attributes
will miss many useful and interesting rules (false
positive).
Let Nx denote the number of rules of type x. To
measure these two factors, we propose the following
metrics,
Data Quality Metric 1:
Qsize =
NKnownCorrect+NUnknownCorrect
Nnontrivial?rules
We calculate the ratio of the number of semanti-
cally valid rules to the number of nontrivial rules.
The intuition is that the larger a dataset is, the more
closely it should re?ect the basic domain principles,
and the less semantically incorrect rules will be gen-
erated.
Data Quality Metric 2:
Qattribute =
NNewHypotheses
NUnknownCorrect+NNewHypotheses
Since the hypotheses are generated by replac-
ing original attributes with semantically similar at-
tributes (children, siblings) in the unknown and cor-
rect rules, the more new hypotheses we get, the more
semantically incomplete the original attribute set is.
6 A Case Study
Public health monitoring and analysis is very impor-
tant to national policy makers and general public.
Public health data is generally of large volume, noisy,
and high-dimensional, which is an ideal testbed for
data mining techniques. Therefore we chose a pub-
lic health data set collected in the Heartfelt study as
our case study. All experiments were performed on
a Pentium 4 3.0GHz PC running Windows XP. We
used the Apriori algorithm implemented in Weka 3.4
[19] to generate association rules.
6.1 The Heartfelt Study
In 1999, the Heartfelt study was conducted to collect
data on adolescent health. The target population
for this study was African, European, and Hispanic
American adolescents, aged 11 -16 years, residing in
a large metropolitan city in southeast Texas with an
ethnically diverse population. 383 adolescents were
recruited, and the collected data included totally 105
attributes and 16912 records. The attributes include
age, gender, ethnic/racial group, physical maturity,
resting blood pressure and heart rate, ambulatory
blood pressure, heart rate and moods reported at
30-minute intervals, body mass index, fat free mass,
psychological characteristics such as anger and hostil-
ity. Numerous ?ndings have been reported based on
bio-statistical analysis of the Heartfelt study, such as
stress-induced alterations of blood pressure [8], as-
sociation of obesity and poor sleep quality [5], eth-
nic group di?erences in moods and ambulatory blood
pressure [9], relationship of ambulatory blood pres-
sure to physical activity [4], etc.
6.2 Building a Semantic Network
from UMLS to Analyze the Heart-
felt Study
Uni?ed Medical Language System (UMLS) is de-
signed to help an information system “understand”
the meanings of concepts and terms and their rela-
tionships in biomedical and health domain [16]. The
UMLS Knowledge Sources are multi-purpose, and
can be used to create, process, retrieve, integrate,
and aggregate biomedical and health information.
UMLS divides medical ontology knowledge into three
sources: the SPECIALIST lexicon, the Metathe-
saurus, and the Semantic Network. The SPECIAL-
5
BB4
IST lexicon is designed to provide lexical information
for the SPECIALIST Natural Language Processing
System. The Metathesaurus is a multi-lingual vocab-
ulary database that contains de?nitions of biomedical
terms, their various names (such as synonyms and
abbreviations), and the relationships among them.
The Semantic Network categorizes all concepts in the
Metathesaurus into semantic types, such as clinical
?nding, organisms, physical activity, etc. The Se-
mantic Network also de?nes a set of relationships be-
tween biomedical concepts. These relationships pro-
vide the structure for the Semantic Network. The
primary relationship is the “is-a” link, which estab-
lishes the hierarchy within the Semantic Network.
Besides, there are also a set of non-hierarchical re-
lationships, e.g., “associated-with”, “a?ect”, “func-
tionally related to”. Using UMLS we created a se-
mantic network for the Heartfelt dataset as follows
(a fragment of the semantic network is shown in Fig-
ure 1):
1. Analyze the attributes in the Heartfelt dataset,
assign the attributes that are semantically sim-
ilar to the same vertex, e.g., “age of subject in
years” and “age of subject in months” are as-
signed to one vertex, and totally we obtain 39
vertices;
2. Extract parent and child concepts (totally 162)
of the original attributes from UMLS, and add
these new concepts and their is-a relations into
the semantic network. As shown in Figure 1,
majority of concepts are organized into the “ob-
servable entity” tree and “clinical ?nding” tree;
3. Find the semantic type of each attribute using
UMLS. Di?erent concepts can have the same se-
mantic type, and we found totally 9 semantic
types. UMLS provides 49 relations among these
semantic types, and they were added into the
network as “associated-with” or more speci?c
edges, e.g., “a?ect” and “indicate”, and labeled
with BASIC ;
4. Ask a user to add additional “associated-with”
edges labeled with KNOWN and specify trivial
attribute-value pairs. In our experiment, we add
“associated-with” edges that should be known
by general public, such as “body mass index is
associated with obesity”, “age is associated with
sexual maturity”, etc. Trivial attribute-value
pairs are generally not interesting to medical per-
sonnel, such as “obesity = no”, “blood pressure
= normal”, etc.
It took us about two hours to set up this semantic
network. Although actual time can vary from one
dataset to another and from one user to another user,
once the semantic network is set up, it can be reused
by other users and revised to analyze similar datasets.
6.3 Experiment Results and Discus-
sion
We applied our hypothesis generation method to the
association rules generated from Heartfelt dataset,
and totally we generated 1920 new hypotheses for fur-
ther investigation. These hypotheses point out new
attributes that a user may collect in future experi-
ments. These hypotheses introduced new attributes
(siblings and children of original attributes, excluded
if they already exist), we do not have any real values
for these attributes. Instead, these hypotheses de-
scribe possible correlations among semantically rele-
vant attributes. For example,
ZBMI is associated with Maternal obesity syn-
drome.
ZBMI is the z-score of body mass index that mea-
sures obesity, and it is reasonable that ZBMI re-
lates to maternal obesity syndrome. These hypoth-
esis should be of high quality since they are based
on the rules generated from real data and validated
by the basic biomedical principles speci?ed in our se-
mantic network.
We calculatedQsize andQattribute according to two
metrics proposed in Section 5,
Qsize = 0.36
Qattribute = 0.07
The value of Qsize is low and indicates that the
dataset is small, which is common in biomedical ?eld
due to the prohibitive data collecting cost. A small
6
BB
Qattribute shows that the attributes in the dataset
are semantically self-closed since not many hypothe-
sis can be generated, which indicates that the Heart-
felt study was very carefully designed.
7 Related Work
Association rule mining has been proved to be very
useful in many applications. One major obstacle
in practice is how to identify correct, interesting,
user-speci?c rules from a huge number of redundant,
wrong, or trivial rules. Recently association rule
post-processing has become a very active research
area. Based on whether external knowledge sources
are used, we can divide the existing methods into ob-
jective measure based methods and knowledge based
methods.
Objective measure based methods do not require
any domain information besides the rule set itself,
and can be used by both domain experts and novice
users. However, lack of domain knowledge makes it
impossible to detect wrong rules that are just coin-
cidence and do not “make sense”, and lack of user
input results in presenting many rules already known
by users. Based on the analysis tasks this type of
methods can be further divided into:
1. Metric-based rule evaluation. This type of ap-
proaches use metrics to evaluate the signi?cance
or interestingness of an association rule, such as
lift [2], statistical hypothesis tests [18]. Uninter-
esting rules will be discarded. However, as shown
in [15], each metric has di?erent properties and
may be useful only for some speci?c domains and
applications, and choosing the right metric is of-
ten di?cult.
2. Rule summarization and generalization. To re-
duce the number of rules that need manual anal-
ysis, rules are analyzed with their context [7].
These methods investigate relations among rules
in order to present users a concise rule set.
3. Rule ranking. [6] and [20] discussed how to ex-
tract top-k signi?cant rules with low redundancy.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we discussed how to model domain
knowledge with a semantic network and apply it to
association rule analysis. Our semantic association
rule analysis can generate semantically valid hypoth-
esis, and assess data quality. We successfully applied
our method to a public health dataset and obtained
promising results.
