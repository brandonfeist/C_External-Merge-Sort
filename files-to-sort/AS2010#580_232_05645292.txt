Abstract-Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into chromatin 
by histone proteins whose chemical modification can profoundly 
influence gene expression. The histone modifications often act in 
combinations, which exert different effects on gene expression. 
Although a number of experimental techniques and data analysis 
methods have been developed to study histone modifications, it is 
still very difficult to identify the relationships among histone 
modifications on a genome-wide scale. We proposed a method to 
identify the combinatorial effects of histone modifications by 
association rule mining. The method first identified Functional 
Modification Transactions (FMTs) and then employed 
association rule mining algorithm and statistics methods to 
identify histone modification patterus. Our method succeeds in 
revealing two different global views of histone modification 
landscapes on two distinct datasets and identifying a number of 
modification patterns some of which are supported by previous 
studies. We concentrate on combinatorial effects of histone 
modifications which significantly affect gene expression. Our 
method succeeds in identifying known interactions among 
histone modifications and uncovering many previously unknown 
patterns. Our results also demonstrate several histone 
modification patterns which show significant correspondence 
between yeast and human cells. 
I. BACKGROUND 
This document Gene activities in eukaryotic cells are 
mainly regulated by transcription factors and chromatin 
structure. Chromatin fibers are composed of polymers of 
nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin. 
The nucleosome contains a histone octamer consisting of two 
sets of four core histones (H3, H4, H2A, H2B) wrapped by 
147 base pairs of DNA [1], [2]. On the one hand, the histones 
cover the DNA and prevent the genetic information from 
being accessed by many biological machineries, such as 
transcription, replication and recombination. On the other 
hand, the histones can be altered by the post-translational 
chemical modifications, including acetylation, methylation, 
phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and sumoylation, through 
which the interactions between histones and DNA can be 
altered [3], [4]. Among them, histone acetylation leads to a 
reduction of positive charges on the histone tails and leads to 
an open chromatin state, which is often associated with 
increased gene expression [5], [6]; histone methylation links 
to both gene activation and gene repression depending on its 
site and extent of methylation, and different effects may be

associated with mono-, di-, or trimethylation of lysine residues 
[7], [8]. 
According to histone code hypothesis, covalent 
posttranslational modification of histone tails act sequentially 
or in combination to form a 'histone code' that is read by 
other proteins to bring about distinct downstream events [9]. 
We believe that histone modifications function in a manner 
rated to their combinatorial effects rather than individual 
effect. Many methods have been proposed to find the 
combinatorial effects. On the one hand, a number of 
experimental techniques have been developed to study histone 
modifications, such as, ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq. On the other 
hand, some data analysis methods have been introduced to 
reveal the relationships between histone modification sites, 
such as, clustering methods [10], [11] and correlation analysis 
[12], [13]. But there are several disadvantages of the above 
methods. Specifically, clustering methods are good at 
clustering under all sites but difficult to cluster under subset of 
all sites, hence, they fail to identify whether the sites are 
functional or not. Correlation analysis can only reveal 
pairwise correlation between each pair of sites. In order to 
solve above problems, we proposed a method of association 
rule mining which not only overcomes aforesaid shortcomings 
but also successfully identifies the relationship among histone 
modification sites on a genome-wide scale. 
This method is focused on combinatorial effects of histone 
modifications which have a significant effect on the gene 
expression. To identify these histone modifications, we have 
to rule out other factors which could have an impact on gene 
expression. Gene activities in eukaryotic cells are concertedly 
regulated by transcription factors and chromatin structure. 
Furthermore, since clusters of genes with the same histone 
modification patterns are enriched with coexpressed genes, the 
expression coherence (EC) scores are mainly contributed by 
transcription factors and histone modifications. As a result, if 
we eliminate the influence of TFs, we will gain transactions 
whose EC scores of their target genes are mainly attributed to 
same histone modification combinations. After applying this 
method to two distinct histone modification data, the specific 
modification combinations as well as global pattern of histone 
modification data were obtained. 
II. RESULT 
In this paper we propose a method to identify the 
combinatorial effect of histone modification by association 
rule mining. The technology of association rule mining can 
find interesting association or correlation relationships among 
a large set of data items. We adopted this data mining 
technology to explore the relationships or the synergies 
between these histone modifications. In short, this method 
first identifies functional histone combinations according to 
gene expression and then extracts correlation relationships or 
patterns among these large histone combinations by 
association rule mining technology. 
A. Steps for the Method 
Our method first identifies functional histone combinations 
according to gene expression and then applies association rule 
mining to candidate transactions. The functional histone 
modification combinations have two characters (1) significant 
EC scores (Materials and Methods in supplementary filel) (2) 
no significant TFs in the promoter region or significant TFs 
which interact with chromatin modifiers. The steps of method 
can be described as follows: First, we generated 
3 n transactions each of which corresponds to a histone 
modification combination or pattern, where n is the number of 
sites. Second, we identified M transactions which have 
significant EC scores among all possible transactions. Third, 
we determined N) + N 2 candidate transactions among M 
transactions which correspond to FMTs (Materials and 
Methods). Finally, we applied association rule mining 
technology on the N) + N 2 candidate transactions. 
Notablely, for the convenience of understanding, a flowchart 
of this algorithm can be found in Fig. s1. When applying 
aprioir-like algorithm, association rules were extracted with 
absolute minimum support of 5 (which correspond to 0.42% 
of the whole transactions for Poklok et al.'s data, 0.37% for 
Kurdistani et al. 's data), minimum confidence of 80% and 
minimum lift (improvement) of 110% (Materials and 
Methods). This method extracted association rules from 
transactions whose target genes has higher EC score and they 
are mainly regulated by histone modification. We applied the 
proposed methodology to two different histone modification 
data and identified a number of modification combinations 
some of which are supported by previous studies. And our 
association rules provide two different global views of histone 
modification landscapes on two datasets (Fig. 1, 3). These 
novel patterns we extracted lay a useful foundation for the 
additional experiments necessary to gain a fuller 
understanding of the roles of combinations of histone 
modifications in gene expression. 
B. Association Rules Derived from Pokholok et al. 's Data 
In this section, we illustrated the relationships obtained 
from Pokholok et al. 's data. We selected acetylation levels at 
3 sites, H3K9, H3K14, and H4 (referring to non-specific 
acetylation on any of the four acetylable lysines on H4 tails), 
and 5 methylation levels of H3K4mel, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, 
H3K36me3, and H3K79me3. The above eight histone 
12 
modification levels are measured in YPD medium. According 
to genome-wide distribution patterns of histone modifications 
[14], we selected the histone modification levels near TSS 
(transcription start sites) for H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac, and 
H3k4me3, and selected the mean level of the ORF for the rest 
modifications(Materials and Methods). As shown in Fig. sl, 
among 38 transactions, we filtered out transactions whose 
number of target genes is less than 20. Then we got 3052 
transactions, and after being filtered by EC scores, 
0.08(Materials and Methods, Fig. s2), 1674 transactions were 
obtained. We obtained 552 N) transactions and 631 N2 
transactions, and then we got NJ + N2 = 1183 FMTs 
(supplementary file2). Applying association rule mining to 
FMTs, we extracted 21 rules from 8 histone modification 
levels (Table sl). 
1) Overview of the extracted rules: We can see the global 
view of histone modification of FMTs (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1, the 
higher the EC scores, the higher the histone modification level 
is, which confirmed the FMTs we chose were reasonable. 
From the overall over-expressed state of extracted 21 rules 
(Fig. 2), we found that a majority of rules (61.9% ,13 of 21) 
includes item '63' (the modification level of H3K4me3 is 
over-expressed). It is consistent with the fact that hisone 
H3K4 methylation is a post-translational modification that is 
exclusively associated with actively transcribed genes [15]. 
There are 71 % (15 of 21) of rules each of which is consisted 
of any of '63' (H3K4me3), '73'(H3K36me3), or 
'83' (H3K79me3), and synergized with 
'13' (H3K9ac),'23' (H3KI4ac),or '33'(H4ac),such as 
81,13,63 => 51, 41,33,73,83 => 53 ,etc. 
These results indicate that actively transcribed euchromatin 
has high level of acetylation and is trimethylated at H3K4, 
H3K36 and H3K79 [4]. There are 90% (19 of 21) of rules 
each of which has an over-expressed histone modification 
level at sites within H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac, H3K4me2, and 
H3K4me3. Out of 13 rules which includes '63' item, there 
are 10 rules (account for 77%) that emerge with '13' or '23', 
which suggest that H3K4me3 and H3 hyperacetylation occur 
together [ 16]. Yet, intriguingly, there are 52% (11 of 21) of 
rules can be explained by the previous literature. In the 
following sections, we discuss the patterns extracted from 
Pokholok et al.'s data. 
Fig. 1. The global view of histone modification of FMTs for Pokholok et al. 's 
data. Rows represent transactions, and columns represent sites. To obtain 
global view of histone modification of FMTs, we used a sliding window of 10 
transactions to calculate ratio of over-expressed state of sites. The transactions 
were sorted according to Ee scores. The graph showed the over-expressed 
states of histone modification.

Fig. 2. Fraction of over-expressed or under-expressed state at sites from 
extracted 21 rules for Pokholok et al.'s data. Over-expressed state corresponds 
to 'X3' and under-expressed state corresponds to 'Xl' in the extracted rules, 
where 'X' is the column number. 
2) Cross-talk between (H3K9acIH3K14acIH4ac), 
H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K79me3: From rulel to rule4 
([ 81,13,63 => 51], [81,13, 51 => 63 ], [81,23,51 => 63 ], 
[81,33, 51 => 63 ], see Table I), we found that there was a 
similar pattern among them, which can be formulated as 
H3K9ac [+] or H3KI4ac[+] or H4ac [+], H3K4me2[-], 
H3K4me3[+] and H3K79 [-]. Since association rules were 
extracted from FMTs whose target genes have higher EC 
scores, the above synergic patterns are indispensable to active 
genes. During gene activation state, TFs at the upstream 
activator sites recruit positive modifiers, such as histone 
acetylases (HAT), at the promoter, while DNA-bound RNA 
polymerase recruits histone methylases at the ORF [2]. fu 
addition, previous studies also showed a correlation between 
H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase(POL) II initiation [17]. 
Moreover, acetylation of H3 and H4 or di- or trimethylation 
(me) of H3K4 are associated with active transcription [14]. 
Taken together, it is reasonable that the sites of H3 or H4 
acetylation and sites of H3K4 methylation coexisted in this 
pattern, such as H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac and H3K4me2, 
H3K4me3.We also found interesting phenomena in above 
rules. First, H3K79m3 are under-expressed in the above 
pattern. Since little is known about the function of H3K79me3, 
the mechanism under this pattern is still unknown. Next we 
observed that the level of H3K4me3 is over-expressed while 
H3K4me2 is under-expressed. It is unclear, however, what 
reasons lead to this exclusive relationship between H3K4m2 
and H3K4me3. We speculated that there may be two 
possibilities behind this phenomenon. First, like their roles in 
transcription, H3K4me2 is related with potential for gene 
activity, whereas H3K4me3 is related with gene activity. 
Second, it is also possible that H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are at 
13 
different methylation state [14], therefore, there are exclusive 
at active genes. Then we also found that H3K4me3 always 
was associated with H3 acetylation. The reasons are described 
as follows: One the one hand, because Gcn5 HAT complex 
stimulates H3K4me3, H3 acetylation are associated with 
H3K4 metylation; on the other hand, Chdl chromodomain 
links H3K4 methylation with H3 acetylation [16]. The above 
evidence highlights the interplay that can occur between 
acetylation of H3 or H4, H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and 
H3K79me3. 
3) Cross-talk between (H3K4me2IH3K4me3) and 
(H3K9acIH3K14acIH4ac): This pattern is more universal than 
above pattern, there are 9 rules (rulel-4, rule9-12, rulel 5) 
which satisfy this pattern. fu this pattern, H3K36me2 and 
H3K36me3 are mutually exclusive, while H3K9ac and 
H3KI4ac and H4ac are exclusive with each other. As 
described above, both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are enriched 
at actively transcribed genes, which is supported by analyses 
of the different H3K4 methylation states and their distribution 
in various organisms [8]. Furthermore, H3K4me3 always 
promote H3 or H4 acetylation. Taken together, this pattern is 
reasonable and easy to interpret. futerestingly, this pattern is 
highly consistent with notable patterns of coexisting histone 
marks in human cells, such as 'H3K4me2/3+H4KI6ac' and 
'H3K4me2/3+H3K9/14/18/23ac', which were supported by 
chromatin immunoprecipitatation (ChIP) and mass 
spectrometry (MS) method [18]. There are several similar 
histone modification characteristics between human cells and 
budding yeast, such as, association between H3K4me3 and 
RNA POL II initiation, association between H3K36me3 and 
elongation, association between H3K4 methylation and 
actively transcribed genes, etc [7], [17]. Therefore, one 
possible interpretation is that this pattern can be applicable to 
human cells. Nevertheless, further experimental methods need 
to be done to validate this pattern. 
4) Cross-talk between (H3K14acIH4ac), H3K4me2, 
H3K36me3 and H3K79me3: We also observed similar pattern 
form rule I 6 ( 41,33,73,83 => 53 ) and rule21 
( 41,23,73, 53 => 83 ). This pattern is consistent with 
activation process of gene expression. During activation state, 
DNA-bound activator firstly recruits histone acetylases (HAT) 
at the promoter, whereas DNA-bound RNA POL recruits 
histone methylases at the ORF. Secondly, early in elongation, 
phosphorylation of C-terminal domain (CTD) polymerase 
result in recruiting COMPASS complex, part of which (Setl) 
methylates H3K4. Last, later during elongation, 
phosphorylation of the CTD results in recruiting Set2 
methyltransferase which methylates H3K36 [2]. 
Besides, H3K36m3 and H3K79me3 are implicated in 
activation of transcription, and histone H3K36 methylation 
mediated by Set2 is an important landmark on chromatin 
during elongation [4], [14]. Thus, it is reasonable in above 
extracted pattern. Since little is known about the function of 
metylation of H3K79, the exact mechanism by which 
H3K36me3 cooperates with H3K79me3 remains to be 
determined. 
C. Association Rules Derived from Kurdistani et al. 's Data 
In this section, we illustrated the relationships obtained 
from Kurdistani et al. 's data. In this dataset there are 11 
acetylation sites, including three lysines in histone H4 (K8, 
K12, KI6), four in histone H3 (K9, K14, K18, K23), one in 
H2A (K7), and two in histone H2B (Kll, KI6). Here, we 
utilized acetylation data for intergenic regions (Materials and 
Methods). Among 311 transactions, we filtered out 
transactions whose number of target genes is less than 20. 
Then we got 10941 transactions, and after filtered by EC 
scores (0.08), 2193 transactions were obtained. We obtained 
594 NJ transactions and 760 N2 transactions, and then we 
got NJ + N2 = 1354 FMTs (supplementary file3). Because 
H3K18 ( '6X') accounts for the largest proportion of 
transactions among FMTs and H3K18 was deemed as a 
general mark of active transcription (see below), we 
eliminated rules which contained '6X' (X=l or 3) to highlight 
histone modification patterns of other modification sites. We 
extracted 188 rules from the 1354 FMTs. After deleting rules 
including '6X', we obtained 69 rules. Due to space limits, 
here we only presented 32 rrues (Table s2) whose supports 
are greater than or equal to one, the rest rules are presented in 
additional file 2. 
1) Overview of the extracted rules: As shown in Fig. 3, we 
found that '63' (H3K18) is the largest abundance with the 
ratio of 71 % (968 of 1354 FMTs). Furthermore, H3K18 was 
identified as the most widely regruated acetylation site, and its 
acetylation appears to be a general mark of active 
transcription [11], [19], thus we deem that H3K18 perform its 
function in a global manner. On the other hand, from the 
overall under-expressed state of extracted 69 rules (Fig. 4, 
after elimination of H3KI8), we found that H4K16 accounts 
for the largest proportion among extracted rilles. The reason 
may be that the number of TFs to regulate H4K16 is the least 
among 11 acetylation sites, which is only 2 TFs to regulate 
H4K16 contrast to 15 TFs for H3K18 [19].

Fig. 4. Fraction of over-expressed or under-expressed state at sites from

of eliminating '6X'(X= lor 3) among the extracted rules, there are no value on 
H3KI8 sites ('6X' site). 
2) Cross-talk involving unacetylation of H4K16 and 
acetylation at other sites: From Table II, we found that there 
was a common item (31) from a large majority of extracted 
rules. Therefore, the item of '31 " i.e., unacetylation of H4K16, 
is important for these histone modifications and plays a 
special role in transcription. Furthermore, the unacetylated 
H4K16 has an activating role in euchromatin and unacetylated 
H4K16 in the context of acetylation at other sites is important 
for transcription [5]. For example, among 32 extracted rules 
(supports are greater than or equal to 1, Table s2), there are 
27 rules which are consistent with role of unacetylation of 
H4K16 in the context of acetylation at other sites, such as, 
H4K8, H3K23, H3K9 and so forth. 
III. DISCUSSION 
In this paper, we present a new method to identify the 
combinatorial effects of histone modification by association 
rrue mining. The method is based on association rules 
discovery technique and can find individual functional sites as 
well as the combinations of them. Through the analysis of two 
histone modification datasets, we extracted a number of rules 
some of which are strongly supported by previous studies. The 
drawback of association rule mining is that the number of 
generated rules is often very large, even if minimum support 
and confidence are satisfied. To address this question, besides 
support and confidence adopted, we also adopted following 
methods: First, we restricted association rule with a single 
item in the consequent. Second, a high improvement cut-off 
(is larger than 110%) must be satisfied for each rille, which 
guarantees strong dependence between antecedent and 
consequent (Supplementary file2). Last, the other two 
measures, p-value and corrected p-value, must be satisfied. 
Interestingly, there are also a few novel rules which 
contradict with extracted patterns. For example, rule5 
(13,71,33,63 ? 51) and rille6 (13,71,23,63 ? 51) have 
either H3K9ac and H4ac or H3K9ac and H3K14ac in the 
antecedent, which contradict with the above statement that 
these acetylation sites are exclusive for each other. One 
possible explanation could be that they are mutually exclusive 
in some patterns, but not in others; another possible 
explanation is that they are exclusive, and the contradiction is 
due to noise. Which statement is correct remains to be 
elucidated. Interestingly, there exist common modification 
patterns between yeast and human cells, which could guide 
further experimental methods to explore histone modification 
patterns. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we have proposed a method for the analysis of 
histone modification data, which can identify the 
combinatorial effects of histone modifications. This approach 
is based on the association rules discovery technique and 
statistical hypothesis testing method. We applied this 
algorithm to two different datasets and generated many 
interesting rules and patterns. From Pokholok et al. 's data, we 
acquired 21 ru1es. 
From the landscape of extracted rules, we found the 
dominant signal of H3Kme3, which could be supported by 
many literatures. Also, we extracted three typical patterns, 
such as, '(H3K9acIH3KI4acIH4ac) + H3K4me2 + H3K4me3 
+ H3K79me3', ' (H3K4me2IH3K4me3) + 
(H3K9acIH3KI4acIH4ac) " and '(H3KI4acIH4ac), 
H3K4me2+ H3K36me3 + H3K79me3', which also can be 
explained by previous studies. Most interestingly, our results 
demonstrated a very good correspondence between yeast and 
human cells regarding the dominant role of H3K4me3 and the 
pattern '(H3K4me2IH3K4me3) + (H3K9acIH3KI4acIH4ac),. 
We also obtained several global factors from Kurdistani et 
al.'s data. Because over-expressed state of H3K18 occurs in 
large majority of rules and its acetylation appears to be a 
general mark of active transcription, we deem that H3K18 
perform its function in a global manner. Due to the global role 
of H3K18, we eliminated ru1es which contained '6X' (X=1 or 
3) to highlight histone modification patterns of other 
modification sites. After elimination of H3K18, we found 
synergy between unacetylation of H4K16 and acetylation at 
other sites, which also be supported by literatures. 
Furthermore, these novel patterns we extracted lay a useful 
foundation for the additional experiments necessary to gain a 
fuller understanding of the roles of combinations of histone 
modifications in gene expression. More importantly, the 
method used here to identify the combinatorial effects of 
histone modifications can also be used to gain insights into 
relationships between histone modification sites across the 
genome in other higher eukaryotes.
