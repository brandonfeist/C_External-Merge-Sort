Abstract— In the real manufacturing process, many conditions
influence its process. However, there are three important factors
consisting of final customer feedback information, flexible
manufacturing and supplier selection affect the manufacturing
process. In order to satisfy the real requirements of
manufacturing process, this paper employs association rule
mining of data mining technology including the above three
factors to optimize the process of manufacturing.

I. INTRODUCTION
The intensive global competition among manufacturers to
co-ordinate with and respond quickly the industry value chain
from suppliers to customers has made customer-supplier
relationship management important in the new business era
[1]. In such circumstances, decision-making in each business
plays a key role in cost reduction. On the one hand, supplier
selection is one of the important functions in the supplier
relationship management (SRM) because doing business with
appropriate suppliers is beneficial for the organization to
provide a sufficient production volume with good quality. On
the other hand, customer relationship management (CRM) is
a process by which a company maximizes customer infor-
mation in an effort to increase loyalty and retain customers
business over their lifetimes.
Many manufacturers employ the dynamic flexible man-
ufacturing system (FMS) to promote new products as fast
as possible. Under a static and stable manufacturing envi-
ronment, many scheduling models or algorithms have been
developed to raise system performance and reduce produc-
tion costs [2]. Accordingly, manufacturer need to consider
the factors of supplier and customer during the process of
manufacturing. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel
model to deal with the problem.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
discusses related work such as CRM and SRM. Proposed
model is introduced in section III. Section IV concludes our
work and discusses future research.
II. RELATED WORK
In order to understand our proposed model better, CRM,
SRM and data mining are introduced in this section.
A. CRM
CRM comprises a set of processes and enabling systems
supporting a business strategy to build long term, profitable
relationships with specific customers [3-4]. Although CRM
has become widely recognized as an important business
strategy, there is no widely accepted definition of CRM.
Kincaid [5] defined CRM as the strategic use of infor-
mation, processes, technology, and people to manage the
customer’s relationship with the company across the whole
customer life cycle. Swift [6] defined CRM as a company
approach to understanding and influencing customer behavior
through meaningful communications in order to improve
customer acquisition, customer retention, customer loyalty,
and customer profitability. These definitions emphasize the
importance of viewing CRM as a comprehensive process of
retaining customers, with the help of business intelligence,
to maximize the customer value to the organization.
CRM consists of four dimensions: customer identification,
customer attraction, customer retention, and customer de-
velopment [7]. Customer Satisfaction is the central concern
for customer retention. Prior research suggests that customer
satisfaction is an important source of competitive advantages,
often leading to customer loyalty and repeat purchase. Thus,
the product provided by manufacturer should satisfy the basic
requirements of customer at least.
B. SRM
As the trend toward use of technology to drive competitive
advantage has taken root, visionary manufacturers are starting
to take advantage of a new competitive opportunity called
SRM. Herrmann and Hodgson [8] defined SRM as a process
involved in managing preferred suppliers and finding new
ones whilst reducing costs, making procurement predictable
and repeatable, pooling buyer experience and extracting the
benefits of supplier partnerships. Obviously, it is focused
on maximizing the value of a manufacturers supply base
by providing an integrated and holistic set of management
tools focused on the interaction of the manufacturer with its
suppliers.
Supplier selection is one of the most parts in SRM.
Strategic partnership with better performing suppliers should

be integrated into the manufacturing to improve the perfor-
mance in various aspects including reducing costs by elim-
inating wastes, continuously improving quality to achieve
zero defects, reducing lead time at different stages of the
manufacturing, and so on. In the supplier selection pro-
cess [9], there are four phases: (1) problem definition (2)
formation of criteria (3) qualification (4) choice. Usually,
some publications have addressed supplier selection in recent
years to discuss methods such as structural modeling (ISM),
expert system (ES), data envelopment analysis (DEA), cluster
analysis (CA), and so on. Data mining is also an effective
approach for supplier selection.
C. Data Mining
Data mining is an emerging research area, whose goal is
to extract significant patterns or interesting rules from large
databases. The general purpose of data mining is to process
the information from data, so as to develop better ways
to handle data and support further decision making. Data
mining comprises a number of techniques, such as clustering,
classification, association rules, prediction, regression and
neural networks [10].
Association rule mining, a widely used data mining tech-
nique, is used to reveal the nature and frequency of re-
lationships or associations between entities. Moreover, the
tasking of mining association rules is essentially to find
strong association rules and pattern. Recently, there has been
a popular tendency to extend association rule mining in a
wider variety of problems of academia and industry, such
as customer relationship management, scheduling problems
in production. The basic algorithm of association rule is
Apriori algorithm. Apriori algorithm finds rules and relations
among variables in a data set. The algorithm finds frequent
patterns and calculates the rule’s several indices. Support and
confidence, are the two major indices, which have useful
applications to evaluate the rules.
Accordingly, this paper aims to use association rule mining
to solve customer retention and supplier selection toward the
process of manufacturing.
III. PROPOSED MODEL
A. Data Mining and Customer Satisfaction
Data mining combines the statistic and artificial intelli-
gence to find out the rules that are contained in the data,
letters, and figures. The central idea of data mining for
customer retention is that data from the past that contains
information that will be useful in the future. Appropriate data
mining tools, which are good at extracting and identifying
useful information and knowledge from enormous customer
databases, are one of the best supporting tools for making dif-
ferent customer retention decisions. There are many methods
of data mining including classification, estimation, prediction,
clustering, and association rules. Among these, association
rules can discover the high frequency pattern and discover
which things appear frequently and simultaneously [10].
Within the context of customer retention and satisfaction,
data mining can be seen as a business driven process aimed
at the discovery and consistent use of profitable knowledge
from organizational data.
• Association: Association aims to establishing relation-
ships between items which exist together in a given
record. Market basket analysis and cross selling pro-
grams are typical examples for which association mod-
eling is usually adopted. Common tools for association
modeling are statistics and apriori algorithms;
• Classification: Classification is one of the most common
learning models in data mining. It aims at building
a model to predict future customer behaviors through
classifying database records into a number of predefined
classes based on certain criteria. Common tools used for
classification are neural networks, decision trees and if
then-else rules;
• Clustering: Clustering is the task of segmenting a hetero-
geneous population into a number of more homogenous
clusters. It is different to classification in that clusters are
unknown at the time the algorithm starts. In other words,
there are no predefined clusters. Common tools for
clustering include neural networks and discrimination
analysis;
• Forecasting: Forecasting estimates the future value
based on a record’s patterns. It deals with continuously
valued outcomes. It relates to modeling and the logical
relationships of the model at some time in the future.
Demand forecast is a typical example of a forecasting
model. Common tools for forecasting include neural
networks and survival analysis;
• Regression: Regression is a kind of statistical esti-
mation technique used to map each data object to a
real value provide prediction value. Uses of regression
include curve fitting, prediction (including forecasting),
modeling of causal relationships, and testing scientific
hypotheses about relationships between variables. Com-
mon tools for regression include linear regression and
logistic regression;
• Sequence discovery: Sequence discovery is the identifi-
cation of associations or patterns over time. Its goal is to
model the states of the process generating the sequence
or to extract and report deviation and trends over time.
Common tools for sequence discovery are statistics and
fuzzy set theory.
Association rule mining and other methods are often used
to discover the patterns of customers. For example, Xu et al.
[10] stated to find the patterns of customers (here customers
refer to patients) with the help of association rule mining,
intuitionistic fuzzy set and ?-cuts. In the meantime, in order
to express the conscientious and careful of academy, authors

the proceedings, is not the final manuscript but the mistaken
submission.
CP-Model (see Fig.1) is a classified model concerned
on customer satisfaction and customer retention. To CP-
Model, Lin and Xu [11] classified the customers into different
groups, then utilized association rule mining to find the
interesting pattern for customer retention.
B. Data mining and Supplier Selection
Supplier selection can be divided into two parts direct
supplier selection (e.g. [12]) and strategic supplier network
selection. Chen and Xu [13] proposed strategic supplier
network model (see Fig.2). To strategic supply network
model, the network in a structured way, the product supplier
related the direct strategic suppliers will be searched and
evaluated. Of course, these suppliers should check whether
they can fulfill the demand internally and if not sent out
subsequent demands to their respective suppliers. Association
rule mining and graph theory are also employed in this model.
After the discussion of these models, it is obvious to find
that both of them cannot be employed in this study. This study
aims to find a model can integrate customer information and
supplier information for the manufacturing process.
As we known, manufacturing process is difficult. The
proposed model is included in Fig.3. This model is a loop
process. The patterns related to the product of customer dis-
satisfaction are employed to optimize the existing suppliers.
Then further to optimize the existing supplier network.

during the process of manufacturing. Furthermore, more
experiments will be employed to confirm its effectiveness
in future research.
