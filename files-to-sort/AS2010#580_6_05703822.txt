Abstract 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have served 
crucial roles in investigating disease susceptible loci for 
single traits. On the other hand, the GWAS have been 
limited in measuring genetic risk factors for 
multivariate phenotypes from pleiotropic genetic effects 
of genetic loci. This work reports a data mining 
approach to discover patterns of multivariate 
phenotypes expressed as association rules, and present 
an analytical scheme for GWAS of those multivariate 
phenotypes as defining new phenotypes. We identified 
13 SNPs for four genes (CSMD1, NFE2L1, CBX1, and 
SKAP1) associated with low levels of low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C ? 100 mg/dl) and high 
levels of triglycerides (TG ? 180 mg/dl) as a 
multivariate phenotype. Compared with a traditional 
approach to GWAS, the use of discovered multivariate 
phenotypes can be advantageous in identifying genetic 
risk factors, accounting for pleiotropic genetic effects 
when the multivariate phenotypes have a common 
etiologic pathway.

1. Introduction 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which 
examine the correlations between single genetic variants 
and single phenotypes have contributed to identifying 
disease susceptible loci [1]. Achievements of recent 
GWAS have shown that the variants identified capture 
only a small fraction of the heritability of common 
diseases despite our broad understanding of genetic 
architecture of complex traits. Unexplained heritability 
can be attributed to a lack of reflection on exposure 
assessment, sample size and heterogeneity [2-4].  
Regarding the heterogeneity issue, a bias in case and 
control samples characterizing a single trait may arise if 
we assume that a single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) influences on a single trait without considering 
genetic nature such as pleiotropy [3, 5]. The pleiotropy 
occurs when a single gene influences multiple 
phenotypic traits. The multiple phenotypic traits are 
phenotypic associations among single traits. They may 
be due to association of proximal genetic loci forming a 
large block of linkage disequilibrium (LD) [6].  
    In this regard, incorporation of the multiple 
phenotypic traits to the GWAS can be an alternative 
way to unravel missing heritability in the GWAS. 
Although the GWAS of multiple phenotypic traits can 
play important role to enhance the power of GWAS, 
such an approach has not been well pursued.  
To detect genetic variants associated with multiple 
phenotypic traits, application of traditional GWAS 
approaches has suffered penalties from testing multiple 
genome-wide markers of single traits. This may reduce 
the power of GWAS due to elevating impurity and bias 
in samples. Previous works [5, 7] have shown that 
GWAS of multivariate phenotypes increase more power 
than GWAS of single phenotypes separately. In this 
context, we make an effort to the discovery of novel 
multivariate phenotypes among a set of single traits and 
the development of an approach to GWAS of 
multivariate phenotypes.   
Regarding selection of samples [3], one should 
minimize phenotypic heterogeneity and enrich disease 
predisposing markers in order to select optimal cases. 
Selection of optimal cases for the multivariate 
phenotypes is more problematical than that of single 
traits since the genetic architecture of most of them have 
not been explored much.  
Selection of optimal controls is done in a similar 
manner to that of cases except that controls should 
exclude latent diagnoses of the phenotypes. It can be 
true that any loss of power occurred by selection of 
samples can be recovered by increasing the sample size. 
However, the sample size of GWAS has cost constraints. 
With large sample sizes of several thousands cases and 
controls there has been usually limited study power to 
detect alleles of modest effect sizes (e.g., an odds ratio 
of 1.20) [2]. Thus, we suggest that optimal selection of 
both controls and cases for multivariate phenotypes can

improve the outcome of GWAS to explain disease 
predisposition. 
In this work, we present the discovery of patterns of 
multivariate phenotypes by applying association rule 
mining to 46 biochemical traits in KARE (Korea 
Association Resource) population [8]. In addition, we 
also show an analytical scheme for GWAS of the 
multivariate phenotypes.  As a case study, we describe 
the results of GWAS for low levels of low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C ? 100) and high levels 
of triglyceride (TG ? 180).  
An association rule which expresses multivariate 
phenotypes encoding partial correlations between single 
traits specifies quantitative descriptions of the single 
traits. Association rules can provide explicit boundaries 
of the single traits to be used in selection of samples for 
cases and controls.  
Compared with traditional approaches to GWAS, the 
use of the discovered multivariate phenotypes can take 
advantages of identifying genetic risk factor accounting 
for pleiotropic genetic effects when phenotypes have a 
common etiologic pathway.  
 
2. Methods
2.1 Association Rule Mining  
The discovery of multivariate traits from single traits is 
transformed into finding frequent patterns in a set of 
singleton traits. In our approach we employed 
Association Rule Mining (ARM) to discover a set of 
multivariate traits expressed as association rules 
describing associations among a set of singlet traits.  We 
have previously shown [9] that association rules 
detected by ARM are informative and quantitative and 
have benefits to interpret their meaning.  
Association rules have the form R: X  Y [c, s], 
where X and Y are the body and the head of a rule, 
respectively. X and Y are disjoint predicates (X ?  Y = 
Þ). Each X and Y consists of a conjunction of distinct 
predicates which describe values of singleton traits. The 
strength of the association rules can be measured in 
terms of their support (supp) and confidence (conf). The 
support of a rule (X  Y) is the probability that a case in 
a database contains both X and Y. The  confidence of a 
rule is the probability that a case contains Y given that it 
contains X. Note that the head of a rule, Y, is restricted 
to be one of the traits which we are interested in and X is  
a set of traits partially correlated with Y. Interesting 
rules are manually extracted. 
 
2.2 Discovery of multivariate phenotypes  
Overall process of multivariate phenotype discovery is 
illustrated in Figure 1.   
Discretization of continuous traits 
ARM is not directly applicable to real valued 
continuous data such as TG or LDL-C levels. Hence we 
used discretization to manipulate continuous traits into 
nominal traits before the ARM process was executed. In 
this process, continuous traits are divided into five bins 
expressing extremely low, low, average, high, 
extremely high values by using equal frequency rather 
than equal width discretization.  
The most of the traits are normally distributed and tend 
to cluster around their means. Hence, if equal width 
discretization was applied, bins which include a small 
number of outliers having values above or below the 
mean are ignored from final results of association rules. 
Therefore, equal frequency discretization was adopted, 
in order to minimize loss of bins containing the outliers 
of extreme values of traits.

Association rule generation 
The generation of association rules was carried out 
employing the APRIORI algorithm [10]. We used 10g 
Oracle Data Miner (ODM) which implemented the 
APRIORI algorithm to compute association rules.  
Of 8,842 individuals in KARE, 1,853 having missing 
values were removed. The individuals were described 
by a total of 52 traits, of which 6 traits extremely 
distributed were removed. The resulting 6,998 
individuals with 46 traits were employed in ARM. We

2.3 A Scheme of Association Analysis  
A multivariate phenotype (y) is defined as bivariate 
traits (yi, yj)  which can be a mixture of continuous and 
nominal traits.   
y = yi + yj 
Association test for multivariate phenotype (y) is 
performed by following tasks:  
1: test for a multivariate phenotype (y): GWAS(y)  
2: test for singleton traits: GWAS(yi), GWAS(yj)  
3: calculate odds ratio for p values of SNP markers from 
association tests of multivariate phenotype over that 
from a single trait.   
    ORm=  )()(log10 iyGWASyGWAS  
4:  repeat tasks 2~3 for other singleton trait (yj)   
 
Genetic variants associated with a multiple phenotype 
include SNPs affected by each of single traits which 
should be excluded.  Tasks 1 to 3 are subject to finding 
genetic variants influencing phenotype y only and SNPs 
affecting single traits are removed by ORm test (vide 
infra). All the association tests are based on comparing 
allele frequencies between cases and controls.   
 
Strategy for filtering SNPs 
From results of association test for a multivariate 
phenotype, SNPs are pruned by the following 
conditions and significant SNPs remain:  
C1: p-value of association test  ? 10-4 
C2: ORm? G1 
C3: p-value of an indexed SNP for a LD < 10-5  and  p 
value of clumped SNPs <10-4.  
 The cutoff of p-values for association test of the 
multivariate phenotype is set to be less stringent than 
usual GWAS, considering a small sample size for cases 
and controls due to combination of phenotypes. 
ORm? 1 means that it is 10 times as likely that SNPs are 
associated with a multivariate phenotype against a 
single one.  
 
2.4 GWAS of Low LDL-C and High TG   
Phenotype description: we interpreted low LDL-C of 
?  100mg/dl and high TG of ?  180mg/dl from the 49 
association rules and defined it as multivariate 
phenotype lowLDLhighTG. LDL-C estimated from 
lipid profiles were used. Ranges of TG/LDL-C levels 
are adjusted for those meeting the guidelines used in 
clinical researches.    
 
Case-control analysis 
GWAS of the multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG 
seeks to identify SNPs influencing both effects of low 
LDL-C and high TG, while excluding the ones affecting 
either of the single traits.  
Stage1: An association study of lowLDLhighTG at 
stage 1 was designed for finding SNPs which affected 
more likely low LDL-C effect among ones having high 
TG. Hence, 651 cases for low LDL-C and high TG and 
545 controls for high LDL-C and high TG were selected 
for case-control analysis (see Table 2 and Figure 2). 
High levels of TG were fixed in the cases and controls 
but LDL-C levels were compared. Identified genetic 
variants associated with lowLDLhighTG were pruned 
for filtering out SNPs affecting LDL-C trait only.  
Stage2: An association study at stage 2 was designed 
for finding SNPs which affected more likely high TG 
effect among ones having low LDL-C. SNPs 
influencing TG trait only were pruned from the outcome. 
We named association test at stage2 by 
highTGlowLDL.  
Figure 2  Distributions of LDL-C and TG levels
Case-control-based association scans were performed 
by PLINK [11].  LD clumping for testing LD between 
the identified genetic makers and haplotypic 
associations were also conducted by PLINK.    
  
3. Experiments and Results 
3.1 Multivariate phenotype  
Out of a total of 3,792,566 rules generated, we found 
10,162 rules that were related to high TG levels. We 
326
found 49 rules that encoded low LDL-C and high TG in 
contrast to 359 rules that were associated with high TG 
and high LDL-C levels. Table 1 denotes the 
representative association rules encoding low LDL-C 
and high TG. The rules were sorted and selected by their 
confidences.  
The strongest confident rule (Rule 1) is interpreted as 
14 % of individuals who have low levels of LDL-C and 
high levels of nonHDL(High Density Lipoprotein) also 
have high levels of TG with 100 % probability.  The 
rules which express low LDL-C and high TG also 
indicate low levels of HDL (Rules 2 and 3) and total 
cholesterol (TCHL) (Rules 4 and 6 in Table 1).  These 
rules informed relationships between plasma lipids. 
That is, there are positive correlations between LDL-C 
and TCHL and between LDL-C and HDL as well as 
negative correlations between TG and LDL-C, HDL 
and TCHL.

3.2 GWAS of lowLDLhighTG  
We investigated 350K variants in 8,512 individuals in 
the KARE study for identifying their genetic variants 
associated with multivariate phenotypes 
lowLDLhighTG and highTGlowLDL, and single traits 
TG concentrations and concentrations of LDL-C.  
Additional details of quality-control and imputation 
procedures have been reported elsewhere [8]. Gene 
annotations refer to the human genome build hg18.   
 We identified 13 common variants in 4 genes 
(CSMD1, NFE2L, CBX1, and SKAP1) associated with 
lowLDLhighTG (see Table 3 ).  22 common variants in 
7 genes (HECW1, PFK1, SYCP2L, ELOV2, PARK2, 
and ARG2) were associated with highTGlowLDL. 
Details of these loci have omitted in this manuscript due 
to the page limitation.  
Strong associations with trait lowLDLhighTG were 
detected in the CSMD1 (CUB and Sushi multiple 
domains 1) gene region of chromosome 8q23.2 (P < 5 × 
10-5, odds ratio =1.44-1.50, MAF > 34 %). Eight SNPs 
in CSMD1 indicated that strength of associations with 
the multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG were much 
stronger than that of single trait LDL-C (ORm > 3, 
ORm=3.3-3.84). The chromosome 8q23.2 in human is 
hypervariable and contains numerous immune-related 
genes [12].  
A set of association having robust p-values with 
intermediate effects of SNPs (P < 5 × 10 -4, odds 
ratio=2.03-2.38, MAF > 6 %)   were found in SKAP1 
(Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 1) and NFE2L1 
(nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 1) which are in 
the regions of 17q21.32.     
The effects of these SNPs were modest and their 
p-values of association were not notably strong, due to 
the limited sample sizes.   
 
3.3 Replication   
Replication analyses were conducted for the 13 SNPs in 
two regional subcohorts as well as gender groups (See 
Table 4). The eight SNPs in CSMD1 showed the strong 
evidence of replication (P < 6.5??10-3) in both regional 
subcohorts.  
All eight SNPs in CSMD1 were more reproducible 
in males than females.  It is worth to note that rs7839952 
have the strongest replication in males.     
A previous study [13] addressed the correlations 
between cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths and all 
four lipid (LDL-C, HDL, non-HDL, TC) levels. It was 
observed that males who had the lowest LDL-C level (< 
100mg /dl) and high triglyceride value (> 200mg/dl) had 
increased CVD mortality. In contrast to this, it is known 
that there is a positive association between LDL-C and 
CVD mortality.  
This clinical evidence supports our premise that 
lowLDLhighTG trait can characterize the joint effect 
LDL-C and TG in CVD. Recently, it was reported that 
SNPs in the CSMD1 gene were also associated with 
metabolic syndrome [17] and hypertension [14] .

4. Discussion and Conclusions 
We discovered patterns of multivariate phenotypes i.e. 
phenotypic associations among biochemical traits in 
KARE using association rule mining. Multivariate 
phenotypes were expressed as association rules.  
Association rules encoded associations between 
plasma levels of lipids including LDL-C and TG, HDL, 
and non-HDL. The association rules discovered in our 
study are in good harmony with the result of numerous 
studies for CVD [6, 13] that indicate negative genetic 
correlations between LDL-C and TG as well as between 
HDL and TG. The plasma lipid levels and relationships 
between them are well known risk factors for CVD.  
We inferred that the association rules encoding lipids 
implied pleiotropic genetic effect on LDL C and TG. 
This suggests that common genes contribute to the 
decrease in LDL-C and the increase in TG.  
 We showed an approach for GWAS of multivariate 
phenotypes in order to identify genetic loci influenced 
by phenotypic associations. Our approach to GWAS of 
multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG, i.e. low levels 
of LDL-C and high levels of TG, identified 13 SNPs in 
4 genes (CSMD1, NFE2L1, CBX1 and SKAP1). 
CSMD1 was reported in GWA study of Kawasaki 
Disease (KD) [15] which is an inflammatory vasculitis 
affecting young children [16] and associated with 
serious CVD sequela in adulthood. During analysis of 
functional relationships between eight KD susceptible 
loci, Burgner et al identified a single functional network 
which contained CSMD1. They asserted that KD 
susceptible loci may also be relevant to other CVD and 
functionally be related to inflammation and 
cardiovascular pathology.  
The results of our work suggest that four genetic loci   
associated with multivariate phenotype 
lowLDLhighTG  can be influenced by pleiotropic effect 
on LDL-C and TG and be involved in genetic 
susceptibility to CVD.   
 The GWAS of multivariate phenotypes are an 
important alternative to traditional approaches of 
GWAS considering pleiotropic effects. This work is 
advantageous in identifying genetic variants associated 
with traits having a common etiology pathway.
