Abstract - A mobile agent is a program that can travel during 
execution from one system to another system in a massive 
network. Mobile agent interacts with static agents and other 
resources to perform its task autonomously. Mobile agents are 
particularly attractive in distributed information retrieval 
applications. This paper discusses about how to parallelize the 
incremental algorithm for mining distributed dynamic datasets. 
This minimizes communication overhead between distributed 
systems and the central system. In this distributed approach, we 
use static agents at each distributed local system which are 
capable of generating local model (each static agent has a 
summary of its own database) as well as the global model ( 
carries the summary of the entire data base) of the frequent item 
sets. This ability permits our system to generate high contrast 
frequent item sets, which allow us to examine how the data is 
positioned over different systems. Using the capabilities of the 
mobile agent, the knowledge could be retrieved from the local 
systems to the central system for making the communication 
process better and easier between the distributed systems. 
  I.   INTRODUCTION 
Analysis of past transaction data provide very valuable 
information for the decision making purpose [3]. The 
problem of extracting knowledge is a difficult task for large 
datasets due to their static nature and geographical 
distribution datasets [1]. Due to these properties, algorithms 
that handle large datasets cannot assume or control the 
partitioned structure, the sizes, and the location of the pieces 
of the datasets and must take account of the latencies and 
bandwidth required to move data among the places.  
Mobile agent is a composition of software and data which 
can move from one system to another system autonomously 
in a distributed network. These programs are capable of 
suspending their execution on one platform and moving to 
another platform where they resume execution. Mobile 
Agent’s application proves to be one of the best and robust 
methods to handle the distributed data and hence distributed 
data mining [4]. 
In this paper we have focused to increase the performance 
of existing algorithm by inducing parallel computing with the 
help of co-operative mobile and static agents. Here the static 
agent computes with the data in the local host automatically 
whenever it detects a change. Static agents do not move 
around the distributed databases but use embedded  
knowledge to assist in filtering and processing the volume 
of data. Later, the mobile agent interacts and retrieves 
required data from the static agents that are residing in the 
local systems. 
  II.   MOTIVATIONS AND RELATED 
WORK 
A common approach for mining distributed data systems 
is the centralized one, in which all data is moved to a single 
central location and then mined. Another approach is the local 
one, where models are built locally at each site, and then 
moved to a common location where they are combined [2]. 
The later approach is the quickest but often least accurate, 
while the former approach is more accurate but generally 
quite expensive in terms of time required. 
These existing approaches for Distributed Data Mining 
suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages. 
 Lack of coordination among the distributed sites 
while generating the local knowledge, affects the 
quality of global knowledge [1] 
 Non-flexibility in addition of new algorithm to its 
knowledge base [1] 
 Capability to dynamically discover data sites 
based on user requirements [1] 
 Network overhead, communication overhead and 
time overhead 
In our proposed work, with the use of the co-operative 
agents we are trying to minimize the above flaws prevailing 
in the existing works. 
III. PROPOSED WORK 
To improve the accuracy of the knowledge obtained from 
the local model, strong association rules between the item sets 
are established. The decisions are derived based on the 
association rules. Static agents residing in the local system 
compute the local models, and are brought to the central 
system for combining them to generate global model at the 
central system based on which global knowledge is mined. 
Knowledge from distributed sites is extracted in the form 
of association rules. Based on the types of values, the 
association rules can be classified into two categories [1]: 
109 
 
Example: 
Boolean Association Rules: Keyboard       Mouse [ 
Support = 6%, Confidence = 70% ] 
Quantitative Association Rules: (Age = 26…30)      (Cars 
=   1, 2) [Support 3%, Confidence = 36%] 
A. Basic Concepts 
Generally the Distributed Data Mining process consists of  
the following steps [1]: 
 Generate the knowledge locally at each 
distributed sites by means of a static agent. 
 Integrate the local distributed knowledge 
model to get global knowledge model 
 Analyze to check the quality of the global 
model 
 
The terminologies used in this algorithm proposed are as 
below: 
DB                Database 
D                   Number of Transactions 
n                    Number of Distributed systems (S1, S2, … Sn) 
DBi              Distributed Data sets at Si,  
                          DB = U DBi, i=1 to n 
XSup             Support count of a X at DB – Global 
XSupi            Support count of a X at DBi – Local 
Minsup          Minimum support threshold 
GFI               Global Frequent Item set 
CGFI             Candidate Global Frequent Item set 
X                   Global Frequent Item set 
                            if XSup?Minsup * D 
LFi                 Local Frequent Item set at system i 
PGFI              Possible Global Frequent Item sets 
                     (not part of LFIi, but by adding these 
counts   at  
                      Central system converts CGFI to GFI) 
SAi                 Static Agent at each distributed system from      
                           I = 1 to n 
B.  Proposed Algorithm 
   Input: Distributed dataset DBi, i=1to n, Minsup 
Output: Global Frequent Item set (GFI) 
1. Sending mining agent to all sites 
For I = 1 to n do 
{ 
  MA.send (Location = I, S=Support, Addresses of all  
  Distributed sites); 
} 
 
2. a. Each static agent (SAi) computes LFi in parallel 
b. Each cooperative agent gets LFIi from SAi and 
sends it to neighbors and the central system 
 
3. a. Compute GFI and CGFI at central system 
           GFI?LFIi, I = 1 to n; CGFI=ULFIi - ?LFI, i=1to n 
           b. Calculate PGFI and their count at each distributed  
           system and send it to the central system 
           PGFIj = All Item sets at site j ?LFIi, i=1to n, i<>j           
4. Calculate GFI at central system using PGFI count 
For all X ? CGFI do 
{ 
   If X.Sup=?X.Supi, i=1to n ?MinSup*D then 
   { 
     GFI = GFI U {X} 
    } 
} 
 
The above Fig.2 depicts the functioning of our proposed 
algorithm. Mobile agents are directed towards the distributed 
systems with the static agents and pass the query. 
The static agents then process the query to generate LFIi 
accordingly. The calculated LFIi is then sent to the 
neighboring systems and to the central system. Based on the 
received LFIi, the central system calculates GFI and CGFI 
based on the Minsup.

Now the infrequent item sets are analyzed and a PGFI 
count is computed by static agents and sent to the central 
system. With the PGFI count, the central site calculates the 
final GFI which is then updated in the global knowledge. This 
makes the process of decision making more efficient. In this 
analysis we have utilized the features of the JADE mobile 
agent [7]. 
IV. APPLICAION IN ROBITICS 
The decision making process makes the system to take a 
decision by learning from distributed datasets. For this 
association rule mining with supervised learning technique is 
used for machine learning by creating a function from 
training data. The global knowledge will be useful for the 
central system to effectively control the distributed systems 
with effective communication using the agents. Robotics 
which are based on distributed datasets can effectively 
implement this proposed algorithm to make decision making 
easier. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In  this paper we have focused the problems of mining 
frequent item sets on dynamic and distributed data sets in 
different parallel and distributed systems using mobile and 
static agents. We proposed an approach to minimize the 
response time and increase the accuracy of knowledge 
mining for the global set of frequent item sets, as well as to 
find frequent item patterns in infrequent item sets.  In the 
future work the concept of static agents can be replaced by 
indexing techniques and can be applied in areas like 
robotics, unmanned vehicles etc to make the communication 
process between the distributed systems in an effective way.
