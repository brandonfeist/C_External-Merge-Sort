Abstract—Intervention analysis is the common method to reveal 
relationships between objects in human as well as biological 
society. Data mining research community is just starting to pay 
attention to intervention analysis. As the traditional association 
rules are not successful at measuring intervention, this paper 
tries to mining intervention rules from time series data of sub-
complex system. The main contributions of this study include: (1) 
introduces a new concept of intervention rules. It can 
quantitatively detect at what scale, how intensive and how long 
the intervention does make sense; (2) conduct wavelet transform 
on time series. The decomposition scale can denotes the 
intervention scale; (3) proposes a new concept named directional 
correlation to measure intervention intensity; (4) calculates the 
intervention intensity between time series data with different 
time delays. The time delay can uncover after how long the 
intervention takes place; (5) conducts experiments on real 
datasets. The results show that intervention rules do exist at 
different decomposition scale of the original data. Moreover, the 
number of rules discovered by multi-scale analysing methods is 
always 4 or 5 times more than those found by single scale 
methods. And the stability of rules discovered by the improved 
multi-scale mining algorithm MMIR* is always 100%, while the 
stability of rules discovered by the basic multi-scale mining 
algorithm MMIR fluctuate around 70%.  
 
Keywords: Intervention rule, Time series, multi-scale, Directional 
correlation  
I.  INTRODUCTION 
In the fields of market regulation, unemployment rate 
control and influenza supervision, intervention is widely used 
to control the stability of the system. It is with important 
economical value for the government. 1 
 This study focuses on mining intervention rules between 
two time series data of sub-complex systems. An intervention 
rule (IR) from time series X to Y is a three tuple in the form of 
Interv(X?Y)=(scale, delay, intensity). Example 1 explains 
the meaning of IR and each tuple in an IR.

Example 1: Figure 1a shows the breath rate and heart rate 
time series of a patient suffering from sleep apnea. The patient 
may occasionally suffocate while sleeping. Thus, the burst of 
breath rate would cause abnormal fluctuate of heart rate.

Figure 1 Motivation example 
Let Interv(breath rate?heart rate)=(3, 2, 0.7), i.e. scale=3, 
delay=2, intensity=0.7, be an IR from breath rate to heart rate. 
The meaning of Interv(breath rate?heart rate)=(3, 2, 0.7) is: 
(1)3: breath rate interferes with heart rate at the third 
frequency scale; (2)2: after 2 seconds the change of breath rate 
will interfere heart rate; (3)0.7: the intervention intensity is 0.7. 
The following compares the difference between IR and 
correlation in intervention measurement. 
z Why IR can measure the intervention from breath rate to 
heart rate? 
z Why the traditional correlation coefficient can not? 
(1) Intervention must have direction. IR is directional, i.e. 
from breath rate to heart rate while correlation is not.  
(2) Intervention must have time delay. The second tuple of 
IR can represent time delay while correlation can not. 
(3) Intervention must have quantitative intensity. The third 
tuple of IR can represent intensity while correlation only 
represents the linear similarity between two series. 
(4) Intervention is multi-scale because signals interfere with 
each other in a specific brand of frequency. The first tuple 
of IR can represent the frequency scale while correlation 
can not. 
Tang et al. [1] firstly introduced the concept and the tasks 
of intervention rules mining. Zhang et al [2] proposed the naive 
intervention rules mining method based on association rules. 
Yang [3] proposed the algorithm MIPES to mine interventions 
in parallel event sequences.  
 In another aspect, Literatures [4~7] researched the hidden 
relationship between temporal sequences via pattern matching.

Multiple resolution analysis [8], wavelet transform [9]and 
correlation analysis[10] are widely used in time series analysis 
also. However, many researches consider time series to be an 
atomic sequence. In practice, the series may contain several 
sub-series. Thus, to obtain interest relationships, it is more 
important to analyse those series at multiple scales. 
II. MINING MULTI-SCALE INTERVENTION RULE 
A. Goal of this study 
Given a pair of two time series, the goal of this study is to 
firstly generate all candidate intervention rules, and then 
returns rules with intensity higher than a specified threshold.   
B. Generate candidate intervention rules 
The algorithm can be described by example 2.  
Example 2: Consider example 1. Figure 2 shows how to 
generate intervention rules from breath rate to heart rate. The 
algorithm contains straightforwardly three key steps.  
Figure 2 Generate candidate intervention rules 
Step 1.Decompose the original time series into 2 sub-series at 
decomposition scale 1 and 2 using discrete wavelet transform 
(Fig 2b,c).  
Step 2.Shift breath rate of each sub-series (Fig 2b,c) along the 
time axis forward 1 timestamp (Fig 2 d, f) and 2 timestamps 
(Fig 2 e, g). This step results in 4 kinds of relationships 
between breath rate and heart rate. 
Step 3.Calculate the intensity of the 4 sub-series between 
breath rate and heart rate.  
Thus 4 candidate intervention rules can be generated. The 
meaning of variables in algorithm 1 is given in Table 1.

Sttep 3 is to calculate the intervention intensity. This paper 
proposed two types of intervention intensity r1 and r2. Let Corr 
be the traditional correlation, and DirCorr be directional 
correlation proposed by this paper. The following paragraphs 
will concentrate on explaining DirCorr. 
r1 = (Corr(Xs,d, Ys,d)+Corr(X?s,d,Y?s,d)/2 (1) 
r2 = (DirCorr(Xs,d, Ys,d)+DirCorr(X?s,d,Y?s,d)/2 (2) 
Definition 2 Let X=X(1, t) be a time series. Then x(i) (1<i<t) 
is called burst point of X if |x(i)|>|x(i-1)| and |x(i)|>|x(i+1)|.

equal length t. The Directional Correlation between X and Y

Proposition1. Let X=X(1,t)=(X(i1,j1),…, X(im,jm)), Y=Y(1,t) 
=(Y(i1,j1),…, Y(im,jm)), be two time series with equal length t.  
Corr(X,Y)=r. For any k, 1?k?m, X(ik), X(jk) are burst points. 
(1) if Corr(X(ik,jk), Y(ik,jk))>r, then DirCorr(X,Y)>r; 
(2) if Corr(X(ik,jk), Y(ik,jk))<r, then DirCorr(X,Y)<r; 
(3)0?DirCorr(X,Y) ?1 
Proof: Consider (1). By Equation 2, if Corr(X(ik,jk), 
Y(ik,jk))>r, we have DirCorr(X,Y)> wi1,j1*r+…+ wim,jm*r =r. 
Thus, (1) is proved. Similarly, it’s easy to prove (2)(3). 
According to proposition 1, The correlation of temporally 
adjacent points will not be weakened by other points. 
Moreover, because those temporally adjacent points are 
selected according to the burst points of X, thus, DirCorr(X,Y) 
can quantify the intervention from X to Y. 
III. EXPERIMENT AND PERFORMANCE STUDY  
The dataset is obtained from Santa Fe time series[19] data 
set B1. It contains the breath rate and instantaneous heart rate 
of a sleeping human suffering from sleep apnea. We take the 
former 10000 records and normalize both series to zero mean 
and unit variance. All experiments are conducted in matlab6.5, 
Pentium 1.7G, 512 M memory.  
The decomposition scale ranges from 0 to 4. The shifting 
length ranges from 0 to 3. Only rules with intensity higher 
than 0.5 will be returned. MMIR uses traditional correlation to 
calculate intensity. MMIR* uses directional correlation. 
A. The discovery ability of intervention rules 
Table 2 shows the number of rules discovered by MMIR 
and MMIR* as the time series length increases. The results 
show that intervention rules which are not obvious in the 
original series are usually hidden in decomposition scales.

B. The stability of intervention rules 
In order to measure the stability of rules found by MMIR

L. NT is the total number of rules returned by algorithm at all 
time series lengths.
