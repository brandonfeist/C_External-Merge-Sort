Abstract—This paper presents an applied study in data mining 
and knowledge discovery. It aims at discovering patterns 
within historical students' academic and financial data at UST 
(University of Science and Technology) from the year 1993 to 
2005 in order to contribute improving academic performance 
at UST. Results show that these rules concentrate on three 
main issues, students' academic achievements (successes and 
failures), students' drop out, and students' financial behavior. 
Clustering (by K-means algorithm), association rules (by 
Apriori algorithm) and decision trees by (J48 and Id3 
algorithms) techniques have been used to build the data model. 
Results have been discussed and analyzed comprehensively 
and then well evaluated by experts in terms of some criteria 
such as validity, reality, utility, and originality. In addition, 
practical evaluation using SQL queries have been applied to 
test the accuracy of produced model (rules).  
Keywords- Data Mining (DM), Knowledge Discovery, 
Decision Trees, Clustering, Association rules. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
Currently, Data mining becomes a hot research field 
which attracts a significant concern. It converts raw data into 
knowledge that has a meaning for the real world by mapping 
low-level data into other forms that might be compact, more 
abstract or more useful.  
Many successful data mining applications appear and 
have been deployed in operational use on large-scale real 
world problems in science and business. Data mining 
techniques are using today to increase revenues and to 
reduce costs. Innovative organizations worldwide are already 
using data mining to locate and appeal to higher-value 
customers, to reconfigure their product offerings to increase 
sales, and to minimize losses due to error or fraud. It is 
applied in astronomy, finance, fraud detection, 
manufacturing, telecommunications and Internet agents [1].  
On the other hand, higher educational institutions face 
big challenges in predicting paths of students and alumni. 
Institutions would like to know, for example, which students 
will enroll in particular course programs, which students will 
need assistance in order to graduate, and are some students 
more likely to transfer than others. Higher educational 
institutions can use classification, for example, for a 
comprehensive analysis of student characteristics, or use 
estimation to predict the likelihood of a variety of outcomes, 
such as drop out, retention, and course success and other 
academic quality measures in general [2][3].  
To benefit those advantages mentioned earlier about data 
mining in higher education, this paper will conduct an 
analyzed case study on UST students data based on data 
mining techniques. It aims at uncover hidden patterns within 
data which are modeling students behavior corresponding of 
academic achievement, demographic students data and 
financial students behavior. 
This paper presents a basic knowledge about data mining 
and its techniques and also about relevant needs in higher 
education. It shows literatures and related work relevant to 
the paper topic. Then, it illustrates our scheme in applying 
data mining techniques upon the data and also provides a 
concise description of the target data. Finally, findings are 
objectively evaluated by UST administration according to 
some criteria. 
II. DATA MINING PURPOSES AND TECHNIQUES 
Data mining provides many techniques and 
computational tools that assist in extracting useful 
information (knowledge) from huge databases. 
At abstract level, data mining is used for two general 
purposes, they are description and prediction. Under these 
two abstract purposes, different detailed purposes can be 
addressed. They can be concluded into six comprehensive 
tasks: classification, estimation, prediction, affinity grouping, 
clustering, and description. For these purposes many 
variations of techniques and algorithms can be used. For 
example, decision trees (Id3, J48, C4.5, CART and CHAID 
algorithms) and memory-based reasoning are techniques 
well-suited for classification, Neural networks are well-
suited for estimation, and Apriori algorithm and its 
extensions is the most common algorithm for association 
rule.  
Authors have concluded some criteria mentioned in 
different literatures which can aids when making trade-off 
such as implementation complexity, model type purpose 
(this means that the target model is predictive or descriptive), 
preprocessing effort (this means all techniques used for data 
cleaning, transformations and outliers analysis), post-
processing effort (because of results of different algorithms 
are differing in term of simplicity and clarity, they vary in 
post processing effort needed to make results), processing 
time (time needed for processing or for training according to

some algorithms), generalization degree (how extent we can 
generalize the produced model), decision making support, 
scalability (how extent it can deal with large scale data), and 
finally, common used or not which reflect simplicity of 
understanding the technique.  
III.  HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND DM 
Quality in higher education has been placed front on the 
contemporary agenda in higher education. There are some 
quality characteristics and measures in higher educational 
systems that facilitate evaluating the quality of the system.  
In order to evaluate different aspects of the higher 
educational system, different quality models use different 
indicators. For example, in systematic approach these 
indicators can be categorized into three groups: educational 
system input, process and output. Input indicators of 
educational system are organized as human resource, 
financial resources, and systematic resources. In respect to 
higher educational systems process a series of process 
indicators can be addressed. These are educating methods, 
researching methods, teaching methods, studying 
opportunities, qualitative and quantitative educational 
improvements. The most important output indicators are 
alumni and graduates. Some of these measures and 
characteristics can be used in evaluating the implemented 
data mining system in a higher educational system.  
Nowadays, higher education encounters many challenges 
which prevent them to achieve their quality objectives. Some 
of these problems come from knowledge gap in higher 
educational processes. Knowledge gap is the lack of enough 
and deep knowledge at educational processes such as 
evaluation, planning, registration, counselling and marketing. 
Data mining technology can help bridging knowledge gap in 
higher educational systems. The hidden patterns that are 
discovered by data mining techniques from educational data 
can improve decision making processes in higher educational 
systems [4][5].  
IV. RELATED WORK 
Scientific literatures related to data mining in higher 
education include number of studies based on different data 
dimensions and different purposes. Ref. [5] shows such 
studies which based on students' evaluations using decision 
tree algorithms, quantitative methodologies adopted to mine 
data from Learning Management Systems (LMS). Ref. [6] 
has conducted an applied study about monitoring and 
evaluation of students' academic achievements using data 
mining techniques. It has developed a methodology by the 
derivation of performance prediction indicators to deploy a 
simple student performance assessment and monitoring 
system within a teaching and learning environment.  
 In attempting to find an association between students' 
academic achievements and continuing their postgraduate 
studies, ref. [5] has implemented J48 algorithm using an 
analysis tool applied on data collected from surveys of 
different specialization students of the researcher faculty. 
Main purpose of this study was to predict students who tend 
to continue their education with postgraduate studies through 
decision trees. From other side, distance on-line learning 
with its inherent high technical educational infrastructure and 
huge number of students represent a potential opportunity of 
research by studying quality level of web-based learning 
systems through analysing students' behaviour on these 
systems applying text and web mining techniques. Ref. [7] 
and [8] are examples of such researches. 
Generally, we can observe that many of earlier studies 
tend to focus on analyzing students' evaluations and 
achievements with less attention to students' demographic 
data and other educational elements, especially different 
education processes. Furthermore, they have obviously a 
lack of clear mapping of the significant results into 
educational procedures or actionable guidelines for relevant 
educational institutions to involve these findings within the 
strategic plans of such institutions. This lack may be result 
because of that the researchers are always technical specialist 
rather than educators. What we have conducted in this 
research is involving students' demographic data within 
study to investigate if there are correlations between such 
data and students' achievements. In addition, to realize the 
results of this research on UST quality plans, we evolve 
professional educators, some stakeholders and top managers 
of UST in the evaluation phase of the produced model. 
V. UST DATA ANALYSIS SCHEME 
In this section, we describe our scheme followed when 
we have applied different data mining techniques on UST 
data.  Then, we illustrate the nature of data in terms of its 
sources, volume and different subject dimensions. 
Our scheme uses both directed and undirected knowledge 
discovery. The process followed in this paper covers the 
following stages: 
• Building a reliable data mart (a subset of UST data 
warehouse which must contain all dimensions of 
student data). This stage passes through two main 
phases: databases integration and data preprocessing. 
In the first phase, concerned databases are integrated 
from different applications into one and huge 
database. As a result of this phase, many integration 
errors are produced. These errors are processed in 
the second phase by applying preprocessing 
operations upon the data. 
• In stage 2, obtaining homogenous groups of data 
applying clustering technique is achieved. These 
homogeneous groups present a good description of 
data and simplify next stages. 
• Third stage concerns determining the relations and 
patterns of variables by applying association rules 
algorithms in terms of produced groups at last stage. 
• In stage 4, we will apply decision trees algorithms to 
get a Knowledge representation from selected 
groups of data in driven with obtained association 
rules. The output of this stage is decision rules. 
• In stage 5, results are discussed and evaluated in 
terms of some criteria such as validity, potential 
utility, simplicity and originality.

As mentioned earlier, data used in this model is UST 
students' academic and financial data. It contains students' 
achievements through different academic semesters and 
contains them financial transactions as well. One of the most 
important reasons for choosing this data was the huge 
volume. Because of that some faculties have changed its 
names and also some academic programs done after 2005, 
we find us have constrained to use the data produced before 
2005 to maintain the validity of produced patterns. So, we 
have selected the database of UST that contains records from 
the academic year 1993 to 2005.For lucky, it also still huge, 
it contains about 14,106 students who have 334,211 
academic transactions and 55,302 financial transactions.  
VI.  APPLYING DATA MINING TECHNIQUES 
This section explains the different stages of 
implementation. It contains data preprocessing stage and 
different stages of applying the proposed techniques. For 
achieving data preprocessing, different Ms-Access queries 
were applied. In order to apply proposed data mining 
techniques, WEKA environment has been used. This product 
has been chosen according to some criteria such as 
supporting different platforms including various algorithms 
and wide data input/output options. 
First of all, a reliable data mart has been created. For this 
end, different operations were applied on the original 
databases. These operations were database integration, 
missing values filtering, erroneous values processing, 
variables adaptation and variables decoding. The operations 
consumed about 80% of the overall time.  
Many transformation operations have been applied over 
different values either to be more appropriate for coming 
later processing or to be suitable for some data mining 
techniques used. From an initial population of 334,211 
records, a final population of 330,524 records was obtained. 
As mentioned in the previous section, the first technique 
was applied is clustering. Clustering data was applied using 
different algorithms in WEKA environment. In order to 
obtain a global optimal solution, Iterative implementations of 
k-means algorithm have been applied with different initial 
random values. As shown in Tabel I The instances are 
grouped into 7 clusters. Clusters (2, 3, 5, and 6) show that 
grouping students in these clusters tend to have a very poor 
score (fail). The larger clusters 0 and 3 also indicate poor 
academic achievement (pass and fail).

In addition, cluster 2 shows that students in this group 
tend to have a negative behavior toward fees payment. They 
also then dropped out from the university. 
Generally, produced model (clusters) shows that in 
consideration of issues relevant to academic field, three 
regions can lay out data: student drop out, student academic 
achievements, and fees payment. Thus, next models have 
selected homogenous grouped according these three 
attributes, especially with decision rules. 
After applying clustering technique in which relation 
between variables is going to be clear, association rules with 
guiding lines from clustering will produce clear relations and 
patterns. Association rules technique was applied with 
WEKA as well. Association rules were produced using 
Apriori algorithm.. Seventy two rules have been produced in 
this stage. According to three issues discussed in clustering, 
these results can be concluded as follows: One rule with 
confidence 0.8 clearly shows that dropped out students were 
failed regardless faculty or department. Another rule with 
confidence 0.68 shows that the most students' failures occur 
at earlier levels, specifically at level 2. Students have a poor 
score at high school; have a poor score in academic 
accumulative average as shown in a rule with confidence 
0.55. Students that have good scores at high school; will 
graduate as shown in a rule with confidence 0.7 and in other 
rule with confidence 0.69. Students who pay late or don’t 
pay, usually dropout as appear in a rule with confidence 0.61. 
Three important rules were produced clearly address a 
remarkable new issue: most regular students don’t have a 
good score in academic accumulative average especially at 
Administrative faculty, and Faculty of Science & 
Engineering.  
After that, decision rules have been obtained with the 
assistance of results produced in the last two stages. Three 
classifier attributes (decision attributes) have been selected to 
apply the technique of decision trees. Classifier attributes 
were student status, academic accumulated average, and 
payment status. Id3 and J48 algorithms were used. By 
tracing produced trees, we can see that many produced 
patterns in the last stages were confirmed as decisions. Four 
important decision trees produced seven clear decision rules 
about students' success and failures, student drop out, and 
fees payment behavior. Produced model is as follows: 
If student_status=Regular    then 
academic_accumelated_average = fail     (62%).  
If student_status= Dropped-out then   
academic_accumelated_average = fial     (66.6%). 
If student_status= Dropped-out and    student_level= 1  
or  2  or  3 then academic_accumelated_average= fail  (60%). 
If student_level=1 and   
academic_accumelated_average=fail   then student_status = 
Dropped-out    (90%). 
If student_level=2   and   
academic_accumelated_average=fail    then student_status = 
Dropped-out (60%). 
Volumn 2

If student_status =DROP OUT then payment_behaviour 
= don’tpayer (87.5%). 
If   student_level= 2 or and   high_school_score=pass or 
accepted   then student_status = Dropped-out (57%). 
We can see that patterns produced by association rules 
are confirmed here: poor scores in high school affect 
students' performance in faculty (rule 7). Most regular 
students have a poor score in accumulated average. Most 
drop out occurs at earlier levels (rules 3, 7, 4, 5). Student's 
failures lead to drop out. Students that are dropped out 
usually pay fees late or don’t pay (rule 6). In addition, many 
produced decision rules confirmed that there are a 
relationship between students drop out and poor scores in 
some courses. In general: Most of these courses were at the 
earlier years (1 or 2). Most of these courses have a complex 
nature. 
VII.  DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION 
Results have been evaluated by the university academic 
administration experts and decision makers in consideration 
of some criteria (validity, reality, utility and originality) on a 
scale from 1 to 10. These criteria were carefully selected to 
evaluate the produced model keeping in mind criteria that 
evaluate the models of decision trees in general. Results have 
a general score of (8.4). The best evaluated characteristic 
was the utility with score of (9.5) followed by validity (8.7) 
and reality (8.5) and finally originality (7).  
Keeping in mind all produced results, some of these 
results were questionable. The common level of achievement 
for regular students which were poor addresses many 
inquiries. As shown in Fig. 1, the distribution of the 
academic achievements is so far about the normal 
distribution in which grade fail represent the most percentage 
as produced in the model. This result can be justified by 
various reasons which can be studied by decisions makers at 
UST. As shown, the most failures are at the early levels, and 
these failures affect student dropping out, these poor scores 
may appear due to poor scores at high school, or maybe, 
students don’t know the nature of different department 
adequately before starting study, so students may surprise 
with the nature of the department and so, they drop out. Also, 
some students may have a high ambition not compatible with 
cognitive abilities of themselves. These types of students 
may face many disappointments which can be avoid with 
academic guidance. 
 
Figure 1.  Distribution of student's academic achievements. 
Also correct admission policy can help or even adding a 
primary semester/year to prepare students. Finally, changing 
positions of some complex courses to upper levels within 
programs specifications may help reducing the ratio of 
students' drop out.  
Furthermore, produced model shows that dropped out 
students have a negative behavior regarding to fees payment. 
Negative feelings which are a result of failures may make 
students feel not settled and so, they don’t easily pay fees. 
VIII. . RECOMMENDED ACTION STRATEGIES 
Finally, results can be mapped into some action strategies: 
• Developing an academic guidance program could 
present a vital service for new students. It could help 
them determining their abilities and attitudes that 
will help in choosing the appropriate specialization. 
Also, this program can present consulting services 
about study strategies and skills, administrative 
procedure, psycho-social support for students to 
support their academic performance. 
• Objective admission policy should be designed in 
each specialization independently in terms of the 
nature and academic standards.  
• Academic programs specification especially courses 
flowcharts and paths should be carefully reviewed so 
that each course should be in the appropriate position 
with its appropriate prerequisites so students can 
move toward upper level smoothly. 
• Some academic programs may in need to a primary 
semester or even a year to prepare students to study 
specialization courses later. 
• Some courses which have a complex scientific 
nature which were included in patterns related with 
failures and dropout may be in need to develop the 
teaching and learning strategies and methods. It 
could be taught using tutorials labs to make it easier 
for students especially if these courses are at earlier 
levels. 
• Supporting students to enhance their academic 
achievements leads to improvement of fees payment. 
This crucial pattern can be considered as a strategic 
policy in UST focusing in supporting students 
especially at earlier levels. 
• Students' achievements evaluations methods of 
different academic programs should be carefully 
reviewed and should be strongly involved in 
academic annual evaluation of university which is 
responsibility of quality assurance and development 
department.  
• Building a reliable incremental data warehouse 
involves all branches with different subjects 
dimensions will help decision makers in UST to 
improve academic performance. 
IX.  CONCLUSION 
Keeping in mind the aim of this research, the proposed 
solution has achieved a good result. Findings were well 
evaluated in context of some criteria such as validity and 
reality by the decision makers at UST. Quality assurance 
departments in higher education institutions could get a

useful knowledge about the quality level of the different 
elements in education systems using such techniques. 
Discovered patterns could be reformulated into academic 
strategies about many academic issues as admission policy, 
students' services, and teaching methods. As farther work, 
these findings can be improved with expanding dimensions 
and volume of data such as attendance, students’ transfer 
data, residence data, staff data and other branches data.
