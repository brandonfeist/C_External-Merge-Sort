Abstract—This paper proposed a model and algorithm to mine 
local association rules from existing spatial dataset while fully 
taking the fact that spatial heterogeneity may widely exist in 
reality. The essential part of the model is the calculation localized 
measure of association strength (LMAS) which is used to 
quantify local association patterns. Spatial association relations 
are specifically defined as spatial relations which are modeled by 
DE-9IM model. We proposed mining algorithm for discovering 
local association patterns from spatial dataset. The proposed 
algorithm extracts reference and target objects that have 
potential association patterns and processes LMAS for each 
object in the reference objects for any interested spatial relation. 
Therefore, the output of the algorithm is a LMAS distribution 
map that reflects association strength variations over the study 
region. Spatial interpolation for LMAS is suggested to create a 
continuous LMAS distribution which can be used to explore 
“hot” spots that demonstrate strong association patterns. This 
proposed model and algorithm was applied in a ecological system 
research.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The development of Geographical Information System (or 
GIS) greatly facilitates the management of spatial data, which 
carries topological and/or direction and/or distance information 
usually organized in sophisticated, multi-dimensional spatial 
data structure. GIS and information technology have 
accumulated large volumes of spatial data. Knowledge 
discovery from databases (KDD) or data mining (DM) has 
been an area of increasing interests in recent years (Yee et al., 
2001; Lu et al., 1993; Taylor et al., 1999). As data mining can 
extract implicit knowledge or patterns from existing databases 
and possibly provide a solution to build knowledge base for 
expert systems, it is very useful in understanding the reality 
which is reflected in the data (Lu, et al., 1993; Taylor, 1999).  
Spatial patterns include many categories, among which 
spatial association is an important one (Lee et al, 2006). 
Traditionally, association rule mining is to find out association 
rules that satisfy the predefined minimum support and 
confidence from a given database. Classic association rule 
mining algorithms such as Apriori and DHP (Direct Hashing 
and Pruning) were proposed to draw rules from transaction 
databases. Association mining result is rules in the form of 
X=>Y, where X and Y are itemsets. The support level for 
X=>Y on the base of set D is defined as s% which means that 
out of all transactions in D there are s% records include both X 
and Y, while the confidence level of X=>Y is defined as c% 
that means there are c% records containing Y out of the 
transaction records that have X. With wide applications of 
Geographic Information Systems in recent years, a lot of work 
has been done to mine spatial association rules from spatial 
databases (Anthony et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2006). Much 
work has been focusing on developing methods or algorithms 
to improve the mining efficiency from spatial databases (Wang 
et al., 2006). However, most of these researches have not yet 
consider spatial heterogeneity where spatial association 
patterns over an interested region may show variations. For 
example, we discovered in a previous grassland ecological 
system research, that vegetation plant successions follow 
different patterns over the whole grassland. In particular, the 
successions are influenced by other natural and socioeconomic 
factors and there are strong spatial associations between 
vegetation successions and other factors. One common way 
adopted to partially overcome local variations of spatial 
association patterns is to divide the whole region into different 
districts or sub-areas, e.g., A and B, and thus to mine the 
association patterns separately (Li, 2008). Apparently, this 
division based on researcher’s experience does not have a 
strong theoretical basis. It is beneficial to find a way to reflect 
the spatial variations of spatial association patterns, namely 
mining local association rules from spatial dataset.  
This paper tries to model mining local associations from 
spatial dataset. Our approach builds a set of association 
predicative based on the Dimensionally Extended 9-
intersections Model or DE-9IM proposed by Clementini & Di 
Felice (1995). Local association index is defined to measure the 
strength of spatial associations. 
II. METHODOLOGY AND ALGORITHM 
A. Modeling 
Spatial association rule mining is conducted on spatial 
dataset. Formally, spatial association rule can be described as 
following. For two spatial object set S1 and S2, let R be a spatial 
relation term or association predicative, ARB if A and B have 
an association relation R, where A? S1 and B? S2. Considering 
mining association patterns for an area covered by rivers and 
agricultural fields. Along the sides of rivers in 5 kilometers 
buffered area that 80% of all area is distributed by agricultural 
fields, then we say agricultural fields and rivers demonstrate 
spatial association relation. Similarly, we can say that 
residential buildings are closely associated with roads if the 
former ones are located within a certain distance near the roads. 
However, traditional modeling of spatial association does not

consider spatial heterogeneity of region, we here try to define 
local spatial association index that can reflect the strength 
variation of association rule in a region. 
To define the spatial relation R between two geometries, we 
adopt the Dimensionally Extended 9-intersections Model or 
DE-9IM (Clementini & Di Felice, 1995; Clementini, Di Felice, 
& Oosterorn, 1993) to describe spatial relations. Given two 
objects in a topological space, three sets of points are 
determined in DE-9IM for each object: the interior (denoted by 
?), the boundary (denoted by ? ), and the exterior, or 
complement (denoted by -). 
It is possible to determine the spatial relation between two 
geometries A and B by considering all the possible intersections 
among the three sets of points associated to both A and B. For 
each intersection we consider the dimension of the intersection 
itself. In particular, given a set S, the dimension of S is given by 
the function dim(S),

The spatial relation R(A, B) is given by the following 9-

Any two spatial objects can be described by DE-9IM in 
terms of spatial relation. The possible set for each relation 
includes T, F, *, 1 or 2 which are defined as following, 
 
Example: Given two regions A1 and A2, we say that A1 
overlaps A2 if the resulting 9-intersection matrix matches the 
following pattern,

In other words, we consider only the intersection of the two 
interiors and the intersections of the interior of one object with 
the exterior of the other. We do not care of the value of the 
other intersections (* in the matrix). For the spatial relations 
defined in DE-9IM, the possible results for any two objects a 
and b are described in the following, depending on the types

B. Algorithm 
Spatially heterogeneity (heterogeneous environment) is 
defined as regions where the environmental conditions 
(including natural and social-economic) vary much. For 
example, a spatial association rule like “residential buildings 
are highly related with roads (located around city roads)” does 
not provide useful information if it is at a city scale, because it 
is possible that some locations (sub-regions) within the city 
may not demonstrate such a rule. Therefore, the mined rules 
may mislead decision making in areas like city planning. It is 
of fundamental importance to take spatial heterogeneity into 
consideration in algorithm design of mining spatial association 
patterns.  
Traditional association mining algorithms depend on 
support and confidence level to measure the strength of 
association patterns. Different from that, we define localized 
measure of association strength (LMAS) to quantify local 
association patterns.  
                                                                                                                                          1457
For any object O in a spatial dataset, LMAS is calculated as 
a kind of index (KI) indicating the ratio of the other objects that 
satisfy the interested spatial relation R to all the objects within 
a predefined buffered area of object O. Here KI depends on the 
type of the objects. Figure 1 shows two KI for typical LMAS 
calculation. Figure (a) presents spatial relation “overlaps” and 
the two types of objects are both polygon. In this case, we first 
use a predefined buffering radius for the current selected object 
O (belonging to Type A) to select all the interested objects 
(Type B, for example) that are located within the buffered area. 
For polygon(O)-polygon(B)-overlaps case, where the first 
polygon indicates the selected object to calculate its LMAS 
while the second polygon means that polygon objects (Type B) 
is interested feature type and the last “overlaps” is the spatial 
relation to be mined, KI is an area index. Specifically, for 
figure (a), LMAS is the overlapped area by Object O out of the 
total area of Type B in the buffered area. Similarly, for 
polygon(O)-line(C)-intersects case as shown in Figure (b), 
LMAS is a length index which is the result of the total length 
of the intersected segments by Object O out of the total length 
of line (Type C) within the buffered area of object O. Through 
this way, LMAS for any objects in a spatial dataset can be 
computed to measure its association relations interested with 
any other types of spatial features. 
 
 
Figure 1.  LMAS calculation model 
 
The basic workflow for LMAS calculation algorithm is 
shown in Figure 2. Specifically, 11 operators and their 
combined ones for the spatial association relations are defined 
first based on the definition in Section 2.1. Then spatial dataset, 
composed of GIS layers, is input to be processed by the defined 
operators. During data input, we only extract interested spatial 
objects from the dataset. Therefore, we define reference entities 
and target entities. Reference entities are a set of objects that 
are defined to mine their spatial relation with other features 
while target entities are those that may be associated with 
reference entities. The extraction of reference and target entities 
can be done through GIS attribute or spatial filtering. With the 
input of extracted entities, the spatial operators output LMAS, 
which is actually strength distribution of local associations, for 
each object in the reference entity set. To better reflect the local 
associations for the whole region, a spatial interpolation is 
performed to create a continuous LMAS distribution map for 
the region. For reference entities that are line or polygon, 
spatial sampling needs be performed before the interpolation.

III. CASE STUDY 
A. Description 
The proposed approach was applied to mine vegetation 
succession patterns in Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia, 
China (Figure 1). The region covers an area of 10, 000 km2. 
Over the last several decades, the human population keeps 
growing and overgrazing now becomes an important issue due 
to its impact on vegetation degradation. It is very helpful to 
find out what may be associated with plant succession process 
which reflects vegetation degradation. Due to the heterogeneity 
of the grassland in terms of natural and socioeconomic 
development, it is expected that the associations may have 
spatial variations. We intended to study the variations of spatial 
association over the whole region.  
The vegetation classification system consisting of 11 
vegetation communities is determined based on the plant 
ecological and biological features (Sha et. al., 2008). 
Ecologically essential vegetation succession pathway was 
analyzed. The main vegetation communities (indicated by 
climax species), i.e., Stipa grandis (SG), is widely distributed 
in the research area. However, previous studies have revealed 
that, in recent two decades, the area which was originally 
dominated SG was replaced by other degraded vegetation 
communities, most of which are Cleistogenes squarrosa (CS) 
and Artemisia frigida (AF). Therefore, our main focus was 
focusing on the vegetation successions from SG to CS/AF. The 
spatial distribution of vegetation communities in the year of 
1998 and 2004 were overlaid to derive a succession map which 
has polygon features (patches). 
                                                                                                                                          1458
The succession layer is treated as reference layer to find out 
its association with other factors. Four factors are selected to 
analyze their spatial associations with the succession. To 
measure the strength of local association rules, each entity 
(patch) in the succession map layer was processed to find out 
the number of associated point features, the length of line 
features, or the total area of polygons by DE-9IM operators. 
For example, for road network layer which is a line layer, 
LMAS of “intersects” operator is assigned to the ratio of the 
total intersected length of the road network to the total length 
of road network covered with a predefined radius (1 km). Table 
1 summarizes the 4 reference GIS layers and the radius for 
each ED-9IM operator.

Water Rivers and water regions Polygon 1 km 
Urban Urbanized areas, (cities 
and towns) 
Polygon 2 km 
B. Result 
The result from the traditional association mining (TAM) 
and that from our approach were compared. For TAM 
algorithm, Apriori was applied on the whole region without 
considering possible spatial association pattern variations, 
which produced a global spatial association patterns. This 
global association analysis was performed on the data with 
records identified by all the succession patches. In other words, 
each record in the succession map is a transaction with items 
corresponding to the possible spatial relation operators. The 
current proposed approach extracts local association patterns 
based on the 11 spatial relations defined in DE-9IM.  
The result of TAM was listed in Table 2. For the 
comparison purpose, we focused on the a few spatial relations 
(spatial association predicative) defined in DE-9IM model for 
both TAM and the proposed approach. The applicable 
predicative in the context of this research, considering that the 
feature class of vegetation succession layer is polygon, includes 
only “touch” and “intersect” operators as well as their 
combined one “touches × intersects”. It could be seen that the 
support values for all the spatial relations are very low, which 
indicates that spatial association patterns between vegetation 
succession and the 4 considered factors (Village, Road, Water, 
Urban) and their combined one Water × Road may not be 
strong. Since all the support values of the 1-itemsets are very 
low, other higher itemsets were not computed. Due to this 
reason, frequent itemsets, if the minimum support is set 0.1, 
could not be extracted from the dataset. It seems that it might 
not be appropriate to make spatial association analysis on a 
regional scale. The reason could be an averaged result of 
spatial association patterns, which buries spatial association 
patterns in some particular locations.

Figure 3.  Study region and map of assocation features 
To better reflect the local spatial association patterns of the 
region, we took spatial heterogeneity into account and used the 
proposed approach to analyze the local spatial associations over 
the whole region. Specifically, each entity contained in the 
vegetation succession layer was processed based on the defined 
spatial relation operators. Similar to TAM, the meaningful 
operators in the context of this research only have “touch” and 
“intersect” as well as their combined “touches × intersects”. 
However, the calculation of LMAS for each spatial relation 
was conducted locally, i.e., in a buffered area of each entity in 
the vegetation succession layer. This LMAS calculation was 
processed recursively until all entities, referred to as reference 
entities, in the succession layer were taken, and all the entities 
in other GIS layers were taken by the operators as target 
entities. The result of the process of mining local association 
between vegetation succession and road network produced 
three maps showing LMAS for “touch”, “intersect” and 
“touches × intersects”, respectively. Those maps are composed 
                                                                                                                                          1459
of polygon entities that identical to the vegetation succession 
patches. In addition, each polygon entities are attributed by a 
field of LMAS value. A regular grid with 1000 × 1000 
sampling points covering the whole region was overlaid with 
the above maps. Points located within the polygons (succession 
patches) were extracted and labeled by LMAS value. Ordinary 
Kriging was used to interpolate the extracted points to generate 
continuous LMAS distribution maps over the whole study 
region for the selected 3 operators (Figure 4).

Figure 4.  LMAS maps between vegetation succession and road network
Statistics of LMAS distribution over the study region 
revealed that LMAS showed high variation (Table 3). This 
clearly demonstrates that spatial associations in some areas 
(districts) of the study region prove to be strong, and on the 
contrary, some districts might have very slight spatial 
association. A predefined threshold value can be set to extract 
“hot” spots that demonstrate high trend of associations from 
LMAS maps. Therefore, the proposed approach is useful in 
exploring local association patterns even the global 
associations are not strong enough.

IV. CONCLUSION  
Knowledge discovered from spatial databases has been 
recognized as a valuable knowledge acquisition tool in various 
fields (Sha & Bian, 2005). The present study proposed a 
method of mining local association pattern from spatial 
database by using the proposed model and mining algorithm. 
Traditionally, the task of spatial classification usually only 
consider the whole region as one unit. We continued this 
further with the intention to find spatial association variations 
in a heterogeneous environment. This work defined an index, 
LMAS to quantify the strength of particular association 
patterns based on DE-9IM defined spatial relations. Our model 
proves to be useful to reflect spatial variation in association 
patterns when the study region represented heterogeneous 
feature. Compared with traditional method which takes the 
whole region as one unit, the proposed method can be well 
customized to get spatial association pattern based on the 
interested spatial relations. Essentially, the method proposed 
can better reveal the reality in terms of the mined result of 
spatial association pattern. 
There are two concerns for further work. First, the buffering 
size for reference entities should be carefully decided. Second, 
DE-9IM only defines topographical relations of spatial entities. 
For mining local associations for distance and angle (direction) 
patterns, theoretical models must be studied to represent those 
two patterns based on which LMAS can be calculated.
