Abstract— We present a research to find the success factors of 
134,549 Open Source Software (OSS) Projects at sourceforge.net 
portal using Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule.  Data from 
each OSS Project i.e. project’s audience, database environment, 
description, developer, development status, download, filename, 
file size, operating system, programming language, review, 
thumb (up and down), topic, translation, and user interface are 
collected and then stored into database to be analyzed using 
Weka Datamining Tool.  The Datamining Association Rule is 
used to find the success factors of these projects by assuming that 
the success is reflected by the number of downloads.  The success 
factors of these OSS Projects are found by performing 2-Itemset 
Association Rules.  The result is then formulated into six success 
factors that should be utilized by future initiators and other 
developers of OSS Project to increase the possibilty of success of 
their OSS Projects. 
 
Keywords— Open Source Software Project, Datamining, 2-
Itemset Association Rule, Success Factor, sourceforge.net 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, Open Source Software (OSS) has become one 
of the popular term in Information Technology / Computer 
Science.  OSS Project is a software development methodology 
that allows developers from all across the globe to 
collaboratively download, modify, and improve the source 
code using Internet as the main communication channel.  
Pioneered by Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman in 1990s, 
this “movement” was initially seen as the way to develop 
software by researchers, academicians and programmers to 
share programming knowledge during their spare times. 
Slowly but surely, this method receives greater acceptance as 
one alternative stream in Software Engineering.  There are 
already several success stories about OSS Project i.e. Linux 
Operating System, Apache Web Server, Mozilla Web 
Browser, etc. 
Despite several success stories about OSS Project, many of 
these project were failed or stagnant.  Some approaches or 
strategies need to be discovered in order to assist an OSS 
Project initiator and other developers in increasing the chance 
of success for the project.  These approaches / strategies could 
be found by studying the existing small to medium sized OSS 
Projects to find their success factors from one of the popular 
OSS development portal i.e. sourceforge.net. 
This paper is arranged in six sections started with 
Introduction in Section I.  Section II of the paper shows the 
current studies relating to the success factors of OSS Projects.  
Section III describes the theoretical background of OSS 
Projects as well as Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule.  
Section IV contains the Datamining Process starting from data 
colletion processing and data classification of the parameters 
collected.  The result of the Datamining 2-Itemset Association 
Rule is shown in Section V followed by Conclusion in Section 
VI.  
II. CURRENT STUDIES ON OSS PROJECT SUCCESS FACTORS 
Many studies have been conducted to identify the key success 
factors of OSS Projects.  One approach of the study is by 
studying several successful projects, i.e. the study on Debian 
GNU/Linux [13], FreeBSD [4], Apache Web Server [10], and 
OpenBSD [7].   Other approach is trying to find the similarity 
in the processes in many successful OSS Projects i.e. the study 
of Apache and Mozilla [9], fifteen Open Source Projects [8], 
and Arla and Mozila Projects [2].  Both approaches have the 
same weakness since they involve only relatively small 
number of OSS Projects, leading to the consequence that they 
may not give good representation of other OSS Project that 
already in hundreds of thousands.  
The study of small and medium sized OSS Projects which 
are considered successful are more relevant compared to the 
study on large and mature OSS Projects since all projects are 
usually start from small size.    These OSS Projects could be 
found in many OSS Development Portal available in the 
Internet, one of the most popular web portal is the 
Sourceforge which at the time of this research (January, 2010) 
had 160,141 registered projects.  In this research, 134,549 
OSS Projects are selected and their data are extracted and 
analyzed using Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule to find 
their success factors.  This research could be considered an 
improvement of our previous research [6] which overviewed 
only 5000 most downloaded OSS Projects with 11 parameters. 
 
 III. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
A. OSS Project 
OSS Project is a software development methodology based 
on several distinct characteristics: 
? The source code is freely available for everybody to 
download, improve and modify [11]. 
? People who contribute to the development of the 
project is forming a group called Open Source 
Software Community which is voluntary [3]. 
? The primary concern of the developers are building 
features and fixing bugs [5]. 
In order to develop software application in OSS Project, an 
initiator may use the service from OSS Development portal 
i.e. sourceforge.net, launchpad.net, google code, etc.  Table 1 
shows some description about the number of OSS Projects in 
the world by recording the number of projects in some popular 
OSS development portals as observed on April 2010: 
TABLE 1. NUMBER OF OSS PROJECTS IN OSS DEVELOPMENT PORTALS 
Portal No. of OSS Projects 
sourceforge.net 226,308 
code.google.com 73,904 
launchpad.net 17,975 
freshmeat.net 4,004 
TOTAL 322,191 
 Table 1 shows that the study of OSS Projects in 
sourceforge.net portal conducted in this research may provide 
a good representation since it covers quite large proportion of 
OSS projects.   
B. Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule 
Datamining is a technique to find hidden structure and 
relationship in a large number of population [1].  The 
knowledge about these structure and relationship is discoverd 
by using two methods which are predictive and descriptive.  
The descriptive method is selected in this research since it is 
intended to find the human readable patterns from all the data 
being collected from Sourceforge.net.  In this method, there 
are several techniques / rules that could be chosen which are 
Classification, Segmentation / Clustering, Association, etc. 
The Association Rule is selected since it will find 
dependency rule which predict the appearance of an itemset 
based on the appearance of other itemset. One example of this 
rule with 2-Itemset is: 
{A} => {B}    or      {A,B}             ..........   (1) 
Where A and B are items in which their relationship is to be 
discovered.  Item A is the cause (Antecedent)  resulting in 
item B (Consequent) with some certainty values called 
Support and Confidence.  The value of Support ({A,B})  shows 
the number of transaction containing item A and item B 
against total population, whereas the value of Confidence 
(A=>B) shows the probability of the occurrence of item B if a 
transaction containing item A and B.  In this research, the 
selected minimum Support is 10% and the minimum 
Confidence is 50%.

A.  Data Collection Process 
The data collection process of OSS Projects from 
sourceforge.net was conducted by creating custom-made PHP 
script crawler. There are three phases fo the collection 
process:   
? Recording summary of projects 
(http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap) to record the name 
of the project, its description, date registered, latest 
version date, number of download, link of the project, 
topic, user interface, translation, programming language, 
operating system, license, intended audience, 
development status, and database environment. 
? Recording project’s detail information by crawling each 
individual project link page to record the developer, 
project description, filename, file size, number of thumbs 
(up dan down), and reviews. 
? Filling the missing information, finding and deleting 
duplicates and then generating count data from multiple-
value parameters. 
The collection process took about 9 weeks to complete 
starting from early January 2010 through the end of February 
2010.  Out of 160,141 OSS Projects registered from the portal, 
the crawler was able to collect data from 134,549 unique 
projects stored in 27 tables with total 3,115,085 records.  The 
Datamining process was conducted by using Weka 
Datamining Tool (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka). 
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the crawling system. 
 
Fig. 1 Crawling and Datamining System 
B. Data Classification Process  
The next process is the classification of the data collected.  
The following is the classification of each of the parameters. 
1)  Audience: There are 121,095 OSS Projects (90%) of the 
recorded projects that list the audiences of its software project. 
There are more than 23 distinct values of project's audience 
which are then classified into three classes as shown in Table 
3. 
TABLE 3. CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECT'S AUDIENCE 
Audience Class Population Percentage 
Specific Audience  83,897 42.54% 
Developers 57,391 29.10% 
Common Users 55,940 28.36% 
Where: 
? Specific Audience: Advanced End Users, System 
Administrators,  Information Technology, Education, 
Telecommunications Industry, etc. 
? Common Users: End Users / Desktop, Other Audience, 
etc. 
The classification of Audience Count for each OSS Project 
is shown in Table 4. 
TABLE 4. CLASSIFICATION OF AUDIENCE COUNT

two 3987 13.14% 
 Database Count Class  Population Percentage 
three or more 1201 3.96% 
3)  Project Description Word Count: Each OSS Project has a 
short description to state the purpose of project.  The project 
initiator has the freedom to describe his / her project.  If these 
descriptions are word-counted for each of the project, it shows 
an interesting result as shown in Figure 2. 
 
Fig. 2  Distribution of Description Word Count 
Figure 2 shows that the project description is mostly short 
with the peak at about 36 words.  If the project description is 
classified into three categories which are short (< 26 words), 
middle (26 - 36 words) and long (> 36 words), the 
classification of project description's word count is shown in 
Table 7. 
TABLE 7. CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECT DESCRIPTION'S WORD COUNT 
Description Word Count Class  Population Percentage 
short 58,838 43.78% 
middle 43,779 32.58% 
long 31,767 23.64% 
4)  Project Developer: There are 133,892 OSS Projects 
(99.51%) of the recorded projects list at least one developer.  
Table 8 shows the classification of the count of developer for 
each of the OSS Project. 
TABLE 8. CLASSIFICATION OF DEVELOPER COUNT  
Developer Count Class  Population Percentage 
one 110,622 82.62% 
two 15,412 11.51% 
three or more 7858 5.87% 
5)   Development Status: There are 128,215 OSS Projects 
(95.29%) of the recorded projects that list the development 
status of their projects.  Table 9 shows the statistics of 
development status for the projects.

three or more 1179 0.92% 
6)  Number of Download: Table 11 shows the statistics of the 
number of downloads of OSS projects. The number of 
download is 0 means that there is no download or the project 
does not have any downloadable file .   
TABLE 11. STATISTICS ABOUT NUMBER OF DOWNLOAD  
Download Population Percentage 
0 / NA 55,986 41.61% 
1 - 99 10,080 7.49%

1000 - 9999  24,438 18.16% 
10,000 - 99,999 8302 6.17% 
100,000 - 999,999 1831 1.36% 
1,000,000 - 9,999,999 322 0.24% 
? 10,000,000 51 0.04% 
Note: NA - not available (downloadable file is not yet available). 
Table 12 shows the classification of the download of OSS 
projects. 
TABLE 12. CLASSIFICATION OF DOWNLOAD  
Download Class  Population Percentage 
none 55,986 41.61% 
hundreds or less 43,619 32.42% 
thousands or more 34,944 25.97% 
In this research, the number of download is assumed to be 
an indication of success in OSS Project.  If an OSS Project is 
successful, it will be accepted by many users that is indicated 
by the large number of downloads.  By referring to Table 12, 
the project that has Download - Thousands or more is 
assumed to be more successful than other classification 
(Download - none or Download - Hundreds or less).  In this 
research, the parameter Download with all possible 
classification was always placed as the Consequent. 
 7)  Filename and File Size: This experiment only records the 
filename and its size listed on the projects' site on the first 
page (http://sourceforge.net/project/project_name).  This 
filename is not neccessarily the only available filename, and  
there is also no guarantee that the filename is always the 
source code of the project.  The filename is then classified 
based on its extension as shown in Table 13. 
TABLE 13. STATISTICS OF FILENAME EXTENSION 
Filename Extension Population Percentage 
zip 33,352 47.27% 
tar.gz 20,970 29.72%

V. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
The process of Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule is 
using Weka Datamining tool.  The class parameters were the 
combination of two parameters with the Consequent was 
always set to parameter Download.  There are 24 possible 
combinations of other parameters as the Antecedent and 
Download as the Consequent.  The result that have Download 
- Thousands or more as Consequent with Confident ? 50% 
and Support ? 10% are interesting values. 
Table 28 shows all the result of Datamining 2-Itemset 
Association Rule the has Consequent Download - Thousands 
of more.

Table 28 shows that the success factors of OSS Project with 
the goal to get the number of download in thousands or more 
are: 
1. Project should target for common users as audience. 
2. Project source code should already in 5 – Production / 
Stable development status. 
3. Project should work on either Linux-like or Windows 
operating system.  
4. Project should be reviewed and thumb-reviewed by at 
least one users.  
5. Project has filename in zip format with size in MB in 
magnitude.  
6. Project should have either English or European language 
translation. 
Most of the above results are reasonable except for the file 
size.  Stating Common users as audience will reach wider 
segment of users.  Users are also more interested in projects 
that are in reasonable level of maturity so they will select 
OSS Project which is already in 5 – Production / Stable 
development status.  The selected Operating System in 
Windows or Linux-like are also reasonable since both are the 
most popular desktop-based Operating System.  The need for 
reviews and thumbs by other users seems to have good 
influence for another users to download and try the OSS.  
The file size in MB magnitude appears with possible 
explanation that users are more interested in larger scale OSS 
Project than medium or small one.  Lastly, the English or 
European language translation is important since many of 
OSS Projects are originated from this region (English-
speaking countries or other European language-speaking 
countries). It is also interesting to note that some freedom is 
still available for project initiator to decide i.e. topic, 
programming language and description of his/her project 
without affecting the number of download. 
Some caution should be considered relating to these rules.  
The subject being researched is small to medium OSS Projects 
 from sourceforge.net that may not reflect the whole 
population of OSS Projects that are small, medium and large 
scale.  These result should also verified using OSS Project 
data from other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code, etc. to 
verify their validity. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
We present the Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule of 
134,549 OSS Projects crawled from sourceforge.net portal. 
This covers about 84% of the total of 160,141 OSS Projects 
registered at the portal in the month of January 2010.  There 
are more than 27 parameter being recorded into MySQL 
database i.e. audience, audience count, database environment, 
database environment count, developer count, development 
status, development status count, number of download, 
filename and file size, license, license count, operating 
system, operating system count, programming language, 
programming language count, review count, topic, topic 
count, translation, translation count, user interface, and user 
interface count.  
The result of this datamining process are 6 success factors 
that may be applied by project initiators and developers in 
order to increase the probability of success of their projects.  
The details of the guidelines is shown in Section V. Future 
work of this research include expanding the experiment to 
cover other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code and 
freshmeat.net.
