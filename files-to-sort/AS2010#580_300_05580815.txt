Abstract: 
In this paper, we present a new method to automatically 
construct concepts maps for adaptive learning systems. First, we 
calculate the counter values, where the counter values indicate 
the answer- consistence between any two questions. Then, base 
on four kinds of association rules, we apply the Apriori 
Algorithm to mine some information. Finally, we calculate the 
relevance degree between any two concepts to construct 
concepts maps for adaptive learning systems. The proposed 
method provides us with a useful way to construct concept maps 
in adaptive learning systems.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, some researchers focused on the 
research topic of adaptive learning systems [2], [3], [4], [5], 
[6]. In [2], Bai and Chen presented a method for evaluating 
students’ learning achievement using fuzzy membership 
functions and fuzzy rules. In [3], Bai and Chen presented a 
method for automatically constructing grade membership 
functions of fuzzy rules for students’ evaluation. In [4], Bai 
and Chen presented a method for automatically constructing 
concept maps based on fuzzy rules for adapting learning 
systems. In [6], Lee et al. presented a method to 
automatically construct concepts maps for conceptual 
diagnosis. In [5], Bai and Chen presented a method to 
automatically construct concept maps based on data mining 
techniques to overcome the drawbacks of Lee et al.’s method 
[6]. 
In this paper, we present a new method to automatically 
construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems. First, 
we calculate the counter values, where the counter values 
indicate the answer-consistence between any two questions. 
Then, base on four kinds of association rules, we apply the 
Apriori Algorithm [1] to mine some information. Finally, we 
calculate the relevance degree between any two concepts to 
construct concepts maps for adaptive learning systems. The 
proposed method provides us with a useful way to construct 
concept maps in adaptive learning systems. 
2. A new method for automatically constructing 
concept maps 
In this section, we present a new method to 
automatically construct concept maps for adaptive learning 
systems. Assume that there are n learners ,,, 21 SS nS , 
there are m questions ,,, 21 QQ mQ , and there are p 
concepts ,,, 21 CC pC ,  then we can transform the test 
portfolio of the learners and the conceptual weight 
relationships to the matrix G and the matrix QC, respectively. 
Let Qx denote the xth question, where 1 ? x ? m, and let Sz 
denote the zth student, where 1 ? z ? n. Then, we can get the 
grade matrix G, shown as follows:

where gxz?[0,1], gxz = 1 denotes the student Sz gets the right 
answer in question Qx, and gxz = 0 denotes the student Sz has a 
wrong answer in question Qx, where 1 ? x ? m and 1 ? z ? n. 
In the same way, we can construct the questions-concept

where qcst denotes the degree of relevance of question Qs 
with respect to concept Ct and 0 ? qcst ? 1. The proposed 
method to construct concept maps in adaptive learning 
systems is now presented as follows: 
Setp 1:  Base on the grade matrix G, calculate the counter 
value ),( yx QQCount  between the questions Qx and Qy by 
the matrix G, where Qx = [gx1 gx2 … gxn], Qy = [gy1 gy2 … gyn], 
and 
        ),( yx QQCount  = ,)?(


=
n
k
ykxk gg          (1) 
where the counter value ),( yx QQCount  indicates the 
answer-consistence between the questions Qx and Qy;??? 
denotes the XNOR operator. If ),( yx QQCount  ? n h 40%, 
then consider four kinds of association rules based on Qx and 
Qy as shown in Step 2. Otherwise, we ignore it, where n 
denotes the number of students. For example, if Qx = [0  0  
0  1  1] and Qy = [0  0  0  0  1], then 
 Count(Qx, Qy) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [0  0  0  0  1]) 
            = (0  0? ) + (0  0? ) + (0  0? ) + (1  0? ) + (1  1? ) 
            = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 
            = 4. 
Setp 2: Based on the counter values ),( yx QQCount  obtained 
in Step 1, consider four kinds of association rules, shown as 
follows: 
(1) If the learner gets the right answer in question Qx, 
then he/she also gets the right answer in question 
Qy. 
(2) If the learner gets the right answer in question Qy, 
then he/she also gets the right answer in question 
Qx, 
(3) If the learner has the wrong answer in question Qx, 
then he/she also has the wrong answer in question 
Qy, 
(4) If the learner has the wrong answer in question Qy,?
then he/she also has the wrong answer in question 
Qx. 
Calculate the confidence cfxy of the association rule Qx  Qy 
based on four kinds of association rules, shown as follows: 
cfxy =
)(
),(
x
yx
QSup
QQSup ,                        (2) 
where “cfxy” denotes the confidence of the association rule 
“Qx  Qy”, “Sup(Qx,Qy)” denotes the support of the 2-itemset 
(Qx, Qy), and “Sup(Qx)” denotes the support of the 1-itemset 
Qx. Assume that the minimum confidence in this example is 
0.75, then if the confidence of an association rule is smaller 
than 0.75, we delete this association rule. For example, Table 
1 shows the confidences of the association rules “Qx  Qy” 
and “Qy  Qx”, respectively, where they denotes that “if the 
question Qx is correctly learned by the learner, then the 
question Qy is also correctly learned by the learner” and “if 
the question Qy is correctly learned by the learner, then the 
question Qx is also correctly learned by the learner”, 
respectively. (i.e., Correct to Correct) 
TABLE 1. ASSOCIATION RULES (CORRECT TO CORRECT) 
Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete 
Qx  Qy 0.5 Delete 
Qy  Qx 1 Preserve 
 
Table 2 shows the confidences of the association rule 
“Qx  Qy” and “Qy  Qx”, respectively, where they denotes 
that “if the question Qx is incorrectly learned by the learner, 
then the question Qy is also incorrectly learned by the learner” 
and “if the question Qy is incorrectly learned by the learner, 
then the question Qx is also incorrectly learned by the learner”, 
respectively. (i.e., Incorrect to Incorrect)

Setp 3: Create a new question-concept QC’ from the 
question-concept matrix QC base on two cases, shown as 
follows: 
Case 1: If there are more than one nonzero values in a 
concept Ct’s column for all questions Qs from matrix QC, 
where 1 ? s ? m, m is the number of questions, then we 
calculate the qc’st , shown as follows:

'                       (3) 
Case 2: Otherwise, we let 
 qc’st = qcst,                        (4) 
where qc’st denotes the degree of relevance of question Qs 
with respect to concept Ct of matrix QC’, 1 ? s ? m, 1 ? t ? p, 
m is the number of questions, p is the number of concepts and 
0 ? qc’st ? 1, qcst denotes the degree of relevance of question 
Qs with respect to concept Ct of matrix QC, 1 ? s ? m, 1 ? t ? 
p, m is the number of questions, p is the number of concepts 
and 0 ? qcst ? 1 and

=
m
u
utqc

 denotes the total degree of 
relevance of concept Ct in all questions. Assume that the 
association rule “Qx  Qy” is based on “incorrectly learned 
to incorrectly learned” and it’s concept relationship is “Ci  
Cj”, where Ci denotes a concept appearing in the question Qx, 
Cj denotes a concept appearing in the question Qy, 1 ? i ? p, 1 
? j ? p and i ? j. Because “PQ” and “~Q  ~P” are 
2490
Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010
  
logically equivalent, if the association rule?Qx  Qy?is based 
on “correctly learned to correctly learned”, then it’s concept 
relationship should be “Cj  Ci”. Then, we calculate the 
relevance degree ( )
yx QQji
CC
?
?rev  between concepts Ci and 
Cj from the relationship Qx  Qy, shown as follows: 
( )
yx QQji
CC
?
?rev  = qcxi × qc’yj × cfxy ,      (5) 
where “ ( )
yx QQji
CC
?
?rev ” denotes the relevance degree of the 
relationship “Ci  Cj” from the relationship “Qx  Qy”, ( ) [ ],1,0rev ??
? yx QQji
CC  Ci denotes a concept in question Qx, 
Cj denotes a concept in question Qy, qcxi denotes the degree of 
relevance of question Qx with respect to concept Ci of matrix 
QC, and 0 ? qcxi ? 1 and qc’yj denotes the degree of relevance 
of question Qy with respect to concept Cj of matrix QC’, and 
0 ? qcyj’? 1 and cfxy denotes the confidence of the association 
rule “Qx  Qy”. 
Step 4: Let 
? = Min(qcst),                       (6) 
where ? denotes the threshold value of the relevance degree 
??[0,1], qcst denotes the degree of relevance of question Qs 
with respect to concept Ct of matrix QC, 1 ? s ? m, 1 ? t ? p,  
m is the number of questions, p is the number of concepts,  
and 0 ? qcst ? 1. If ( )
yx QQji
CC
?
?rev is smaller than ?, then 
we calculate ?: 
            ? = Ni + Nj,                       (7) 
where ? denotes the summation of Ni and Nj, Ni denotes the 
number of the questions which have concept Ci, Nj denotes 
the number of the questions which have concept Cj. If ? < m 
× 50%, then we preserve the relevance degree 
( )
yx QQji
CC
?
?rev  even though it is smaller than threshold 
value ?, where m is the number of total questions. Because 
question Qx and question Qy are the unusual questions which 
contain the concept Ci and concept Cj, respectively, we 
consider the relationship “Ci  Cj” is more important 
between Qx and Qy. 
Step 5: Construct the concepts-relationship between any two 
concepts Ci and Cj. If ( )
yx QQji
CC
?
?rev  is larger than ? or ? 
< m × 50%, then we set the relationship form the concept Ci 
to the concept Cj with the relevance degree, where the 
concepts-relationship from Ci to Cj means that the concept Ci 
should be the pre-required concept of the concept Cj. 
Step 6: If there are more than one concepts- relationship 
between concepts Ci and Cj, then we only keep the 
concept-relationship with the maximum relevance degree and 
delete the others.

[Step 1] Based on the grade matrix G, we can calculate the 
counter values ),( yx QQCount between any two questions Qx 
and Qy, where 1 ? x ? 5, 1 ? y ? 5 and x ? y, shown as 
follows: 
Count(Q1, Q2) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [0  0  0  0  1]) 
            = (0  0? ) + (0  0? ) + (0  0? ) + (1  0? ) + (1  1? ) 
            = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 
            = 4, 
Count(Q1, Q3) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [0  0  0  0  0]) = 3, 
Count(Q1, Q4) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [1  1  0  0  0]) = 1, 
Count(Q1, Q5) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 0, 
Count(Q2, Q3) = Count([0  0  0  0  1], [0  0  0  0  0]) = 4, 
Count(Q2, Q4) = Count([0  0  0  0  1], [1  1  0  0  0]) = 2, 
Count(Q2, Q5) = Count([0  0  0  0  1], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 1, 
Count(Q3, Q4) = Count([0  0  0  0  0], [1  1  0  0  0]) = 3, 
Count(Q3, Q5) = Count([0  0  0  0  0], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 2, 
Count(Q4, Q5) = Count([1  1  0  0  0], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 4. 
We keep the counter values which are not smaller than 40% 
of n, where n is the number of students. Because the number 
of students is 5 (i.e., n = 5), we can see that 5 × 40% = 2. 
[Step 2] Based on the counter values obtained in Step 1, we 
consider four kinds of association rules. Table ˆ and Table ? 
show the support of the 1-itemset of the questions that the 
learner gets the right answer and the support of the 1-itemset 
of the questions that the learners has a wrong answer, 
respectively.

Based on Table ˆ, Table ?, Table ? and Table ?, we can 
calculate the confidences of the association rules.? The 
minimum confidence we used in this example is 0.75. If the 
confidence of the association rule is smaller than 0.75, then 
we delete the association rule. The results are shown as

                          ( )25rev CC ?  = 1 × 0.286 × 1 = 0.286, 
                          ( )45rev CC ?  = 1 × 0.3 × 1 = 0.3. 
(x) For Q5  Q4: Based on the incorrect to incorrect 
relationship, we can get 
                     ( )15rev CC ?  = 1 × 0.167 × 1 = 0.167, 
                     ( )25rev CC ?  = 1 × 0.286 × 1 = 0.286, 
                     ( )45rev CC ?  = 1 × 0.3 × 1 = 0.3. 
[Step 4] Based on Eqs. (6) and (7), we can get: 
                  ? = 0.3 , 
                      rev(C2  C1) = 0.278,  and ? = 2 + 3 = 5, 
                      rev(C1  C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 3 + 2 = 5, 
                      rev(C3  C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 1 + 2 = 3, 
                      rev(C1  C3) = 0.15,   and ? = 3 + 1 = 4, 
                      rev(C2  C1) = 0.111,  and ? = 2 + 3 = 5, 
                      rev(C2  C3) = 0.2,    and ? = 2 + 1 = 3, 
                      rev(C4  C1) = 0.083,  and ? = 1 + 3 = 4, 
                      rev(C4  C3) = 0.15,   and ? = 1 + 1 = 2, 
                      rev(C5  C1) = 0.278,  and ? = 1 + 3 = 4, 
                      rev(C5  C1) = 0.167,  and ? = 1 + 3 = 4, 
                      rev(C5  C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 1 + 2 = 3, 
                      rev(C5  C1) = 0.167,  and ? = 1 + 3 = 4, 
                      rev(C5  C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 1 + 2 = 3, 
[Step 5] Based on the concepts-relationship whose relevance 
degree are larger than ? (i.e., 0.3) or ? < 5 × 50% (i.e., ? < 
2.5), then we add an arrow form the concept Ci to the concept 
Cj associated with the relevance degree, as shown in?Fig. 1.

[Step 6] Finally, we get the complete concepts-relationship 
map, as shown in Fig. 2.

4. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have presented a new method to 
automatically construct concepts maps for adaptive learning 
systems. First, we calculate the counter values, where the 
counter values indicate the answer-consistence between any 
two questions. Then, base on four kinds of association rules, 
we apply the Apriori Algorithm [1] to mine some information. 
Finally, we calculate the relevance degree between any two 
concepts to construct concepts maps for adaptive learning 
systems. The proposed method provides us with a useful way 
to construct concepts map in adaptive learning systems.
