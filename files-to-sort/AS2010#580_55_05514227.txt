I. INTRODUCTION 
With the maturity of database technology and 
application of universal, the amount of data accumulated 
with an exponential rate of rapid growth in human being. 
On the 21st century, when the volume of data grow 
extremely, if there is no effective way to extract useful 
information and knowledge, people will feel as helpless as 
to the needle in the haystack on face the ocean of 
information. 
It is estimated that a large enterprise database data, 
only 7% is well applied. In this way, as opposed to "data 
glut" and the "information explosion", people also felt that 
the "information poor" (Information poor). 
Enterprises attach importance to Logistics as a third 
source of increasing profits, and the enormous data stream 
based on information logistics network system, so difficult 
for enterprises make accurate and efficient 
decision-making based on these data. 
Therefore, how to discover the useful data?fresh 
knowledge and information in order to help decision 
makers quickly and accurately make decisions from the 
data ocean, This gives theorists and practitioners new 
questions. 
SJEP algorithm which based on the logistics 
information platform can help decision makers quickly 
and accurately decisions to achieve the control of the 
logistics process.  
 
II. CLASSIFICATION OF DATA MINING 
ALGORITHMS 
Data mining association rules is one of the most active 
research methodologies in 1993, proposed by Agrawal etc. 
It was originally put forward for the market basket 
analysis, and its purpose is to discover different 
commodities trading database, the link between the rules, 
these rules which can be used to guide the business to 
arrange purchase inventory and shelf design. 
Association rule mining problem find the right course 
of association rules through a user-specified minimum 
support and minimum confidence level on given a 
transaction database D. In general, association rule mining 
problem can be divided into discovered frequent item sets 
and generate association rules on two issues. 
Frequent item sets are the focus of association rules 
algorithms in recent years, its research is based on 
Agrawal who created item sets lattice space theory. 
As for generating association rules in terms of major 
items in each frequent focus on them, one by one 
matching rules and conduct Confidence ? min Confidence 
testing is necessary, so this part of the work is relatively 
more mature. 
In 1994, Agrawal proposed Apriori association rules 
algorithm, since then Apriori algorithm served as the 
classic for association rules algorithm referenced. 
Apriori algorithm idea used a method known as step 
by step in the iterative search through the growing number 
of frequent item sets of elements of the project to the 
gradual completion discovered, that means the k item set 
for the exploration (k + l) set. 
First of all, to identify a set of frequent sets of 1, the set 
denoted in 1L , for 1L  sets to find frequent collection of 
2L , and 2L  used to find 3L , and so continue until it 
can not find frequent k item sets in KL .

 Recycling process created in the first set of k candidate 
item set is kC , and then generated by scanning the 
database and test the degree of support generated k 
frequent item sets KL , every KL  needed to find to scan 
a database once again.  
For the existence of a large number of frequent 
patterns, long patterns, or the minimum support threshold 
is small, such Apriori algorithm will spend a large number 
of overhead to deal with an extraordinary candidate item 
set. 
Since each generates a candidate item set, we must 
scan the database to determine its degree of support. 
Therefore, a lot of waiting set of options for the 
database need to continue to access the database through 
pattern matching to calculate the degree of support item 
sets requires a lot of I/O overhead. The above 
considerations determine the efficiency of Apriori 
algorithm not too high. 
On the 2000,Ramamo hanarao and Dong bring 
forward a jump Emerging Patterns (JEP) which contains a 
very important feature of powerful classification ability on 
analysis of the shortcomings based Apriori algorithm. 
It identifies each data set (or class) the unique 
characteristics revealed in the jumping mode, JEP is 
defined as an item set, its support for a data set to 0, in 
another data set for non 0 degree of support a growth rate 
of ?. 
By gathering all of the JEP, it can generate strong 
classification ability. In some large data sets for the 
classification of the number of JEP is usually large, the 
naive algorithm is used to tap all of the JEP and 
calculation of their collective effect is a very 
time-consuming. 
Therefore, JEP Classifier algorithms mine the border 
JEP based on an algorithm. In addition, the rep will also 
help select those who are most expressive of the JEP. 
On Comparison with Classification algorithm 
published and compared, JEP Classifiers really can 
achieve higher prediction accuracy. 
 
III. SJEP ALGORITHM THEORY 
A  SJEP Classification Algorithm 
Through the study mention earlier, algorithms are 
usually continued several hours based on the classification 
of JEP stages of learning, one of the reasons is that a lot of 
unnecessary JEP is excavated. 
The SJEP (that is the most effective jump Emerging 
Patterns) is a recently proposed by a special kind of JEP. 
Compared to the existing classification based on JEP, 
using only SJEP classifications used in the establishment 
of JEP is a small number, it can not only receive the same 
or higher prediction accuracy, but also completed the 
learning phase in a very short period of time (usually 
several seconds ). 
In addition, the average prediction accuracy is also 
better than the CBA and C4.5 classification algorithms 
such as. 
Because SJEP is a special JEP, so the algorithm can 
directly use the existing excavated all of the JEP, and then 
choose the SJEP.  
For SJEP features, inspired by the FP growth 
algorithm, this article uses an efficient algorithm for direct 
mining SJEP all the items in the training data set of 
information stored in the expansion of compressed tree 
structure, and then use models to segment the growth of 
our mining SJEP.  
B  SJEP algorithm structure 
Definition: Assumptions 1C  and 2C  are two 
different classes of data musters?Pre-specified minimum 
support threshold min-sup> 0?From 1C  to 2C  of the 
most effective jump Emerging Patterns (SJEP), recorded 
as SJEP ( 1C , 2C ). 
Set up an item set X meet the following two 
conditions: ? 1 ?
supmin)X(supp0)(supp C21 ??= andXC ?? 2
?any subset of X, does not meet the conditions for 1. 
Example: The following table simplifies the training 
data set, it contains two classes 1C and 2C . (See Figure 
?). 
     Figure?: The training data sets 
1C  2C  
{1?3?4?5} 
{1} 
{2?5} 
{2?3?4?5} 
{1?2?3} 
{2?3?5} 
{1?4} 
{4?5} 
In this case a total of 10 JEP, where are(l, 5), (2,4), 
(3,4), (2,3,4), (3,4,5), (l, 3,5) , (1,4,5), (2,4,5) and (l, 3,4) 
supports Class 1, (1,2) support class 2. 
Suppose the minimum thresholds of support for the 
l%, according to SJEP definition: (2,3,4), (3,4,5), (1,3,5), 
(1,4,5), (2,4,5) and (1,3,4) are not necessary?Because 
(1,5) is (1,3,5) and (l, 4,5) subset ? (2,4) is (2,3,4) and 
(2,4,5) subset, (3,4) is (2,3,4), (3,4,5) and (l, 3,4) subset. 
So SJEP includes only the (1,5), (2,4) and (3,4), which 
is supports Class 1, (1,2) support class 2, a total of four 
SJEP. 
90
 Obvious, SJEP contains fewer JEP, and their 
classification is sufficient. 
It is easy to see from the previous cases, SJEP is a 
special JEP, at least the training data set covering a 
number of instances, and contains fewer items (attributes). 
 
IV. ARCHITECTURE OF LOGISTICS 
INFORMATION PLATFORM 
Logistics Information Platform is the economic region 
in a certain context, links to logistics clients 
(manufacturing, commercial and wholesale enterprises, 
etc.), logistics companies (3PL, transportation, storage, 
etc.) and logistics-related sectors (transport, quality 
inspection, customs, taxation industrial and commercial, 
maritime, banking, etc.) socialization, open, Internet-based 
public information system. 
The construction of modern logistics information 
platform is: to achieve highly efficient logistics services 
through the creation of a unified logistics information 
platform, breaking departmental separatism and 
fragmentation and establish a collaborative working 
mechanism; integration of logistics information platform 
of existing information resources. 
Logistics Information Platform design requirements 
are mainly embodied in compatibility, efficiency, 
accuracy, effectiveness, safety and stability, and so on. 
According to the function and organization of different 
data models on Common information platform, 
information platform should be composed of the following 
subsystems: 
Data management subsystem: There are two main 
modules, one is the internal system of data extraction; the 
other is related to the data on external docking (e.g., traffic 
simulation subsystem); 
Intelligent distribution management subsystem: The 
system is primarily support the vehicle's program 
scheduling and tracking through the GIS / GPS data 
organization reference model, the main data is the traffic 
flow background data; 
Logistics Operation Management Subsystem: This 
system is support cargo tracking and tracing service 
mainly through the linear reference model data 
organization; the main data are cargo tracking information 
and warehouse management information; 
Online transaction management subsystem: used to 
support (transport market trading, warehousing business 
transactions, etc.) various types of enterprises in the core 
functionality of the League of market transactions 
standardized management, and provide of credit 
certification functions; 
Comprehensive information dissemination subsystems: 
publishing a number of sharing information, the provision 
of logistics information to the public services (such as 
national trade regulations, international trade information 
website links, etc), support the inter-departmental 
coordination mechanism established; Macro-decision 
support subsystem: mainly macro-management of 
government departments in decision-making support 
services. 
Platform Maintenance Management Subsystem: The 
main is the routine operation and maintenance 
management and building security authentication system. 
Specific system architecture are showed in Figure ?. 
 
 
V. SJEP ALGORITHM SYSTEM 
IMPLEMENTATION 
According to logistics information platform which 
share information to meet the needs of data sharing 
organizational model, a variety of different models have 
different basic operational requirements, the main data 
query and data manipulation is the performance of public 
information. 
For Figure ?, the five sub-systems, how to efficiently 
perform data query and the performance of public 
information through the SJEP-tree structure of data 
compression and storage of the training focused on all the 
items of information is the main problem. 
Its structure somewhat similar to the FP-tree structure, 
different is that: (1) on count of field, it is instances of the 
categories need to modify the corresponding count field in 
SJEP-tree; (2) on pointer field, SJEP tree has two pointers, 
namely, horizon link and vertical link. It allows us to 
traverse from the bottom up SJEP tree, and can easily 
access SJEP tree items that have the same name of the 
node. 
On generated SJEP-tree, you need to traversal SJEP 
tree top-down (that is, traversing from the root to a leaf 
node) scan data set D at the same time, the training data 
set for each item inserted into the tree; in Mining SJEP, 
traverse SJEP tree only from bottom-up. 
Therefore, SJEP tree do not have bi-directional 
traversal. 
so, in this algorithm horizon link and vertical link has 
two purposes: Generated SJEP-tree in the process of

 pointing with the left-most child vertical link, Point with 
horizon link next sibling node; In the SJEP-tree structure, 
it has a good post-construction, Changes vertical link, to 
point to parents nodes, modify horizon link, to point to the 
next node in the node in the chain. This approach can save 
half of the pointer. 
In the excavation SJEP algorithm, Suffix sub-tree is 
also an important concept, the use of the premise of 
horizon link and vertical link is from a node in the starting 
chain of each node, the bottom-up search SJEP-tree, 
through the following steps to achieve: 
Initializes p to point a node in the chain the first node; 
      i=1; 
While (p<>NULL) 
{PST (a).branch[i]=p->vertical_link; 
branch_count1=p->count1; 
branch_count2=p->count2; 
PST (a).base_count1 [i] =branch_count1; 
/ / Record in order to (a) for each sub-path of the suffix 
on the class C1 of the basic frequency count; 
PST (a).base_count2 [i] =branch_count2; 
/ / Record in order to (a) for each sub-path of the suffix 
on the class C2 of the basic frequency count; 
q=p->vertical_link; 
While (q<>root) 
{ 
PST (a).count1 [q] =PST(a).count1[q]+branch_count1; 
/ / Record PST (a) has an item name of the node q on 
the class C1 and the frequency counts; 
PST (a).count2 [q] =PST (a).count2 [q] 
+branch_count2 
/ / Record PST (a) has an item name, q  
q=q->vertical_link; 
} 
p=p->horizonl_link; 
i++;} 
Mining the effective SJEP from SJEP-tree, to achieve 
the Call Mine_SJEP (T), T recorded as SJEP-tree, the 
Mine_SJEP process only checks whether each item in 
JEP. If it is JEP, then it must be a SJEP, do not need to 
continue to consider any such as a suffix pattern. If it is 
not a JEP, then generates an order to sub-tree for the 
suffix, and then even longer pattern completed by the 
mining process. Process insert_jep (pattern, SJEP_List) 
mode can inserted pattern into the SJEP_List. SJEP_List 
formed by the two lists, were recorded from class 1C  to 
class 2C  and the SJEP from class 2C  to class 
SJEP 1C .  
By construction change pointers finished by SJEP-tree 
method, saving half of the pointer; it also tap the mode 
through the introduction of the prefix sub-tree methods, 
it’s not generate the conditions for sub-tree to overcome 
the FP-growth algorithm in mining mode needs delivery 
go to generate a large number of shortcomings in terms of 
sub-tree, which greatly improved the efficiency of spatial 
and temporal pattern mining.
