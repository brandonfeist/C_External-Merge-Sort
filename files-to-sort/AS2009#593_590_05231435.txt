ABSTRACT: Translating knowledge discovered from a database 
to the form of rule-based representation is a critical step for 
human decision making. In order to realize such key step, firstly, 
an approach of using the concept lattice to extract the association 
rules is proposed. Moreover, the previous extracted rules are 
integrated with decision maker’s subjective preference 
information to confirm the desirable rules set. Finally, an 
illustration is presented to demonstrate the above processes in 
detail.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Generally speaking, human decision making are made on 
the basis of available knowledge and the preferences of the 
decision maker. Therefore, knowledge and experience 
representation is a critical component for human decision 
making, how to translate knowledge discovered from data 
sets to the format of a rule-based system is a critical stets. As 
a power method for analyzing data, formal concept analysis 
has been extensively applied in knowledge discovery to 
extract rules based on the formal context of the concept 
lattice [1]. In addition, since the extracted rules may have 
multiple and conflict attributes, the optimal rules can be 
obtained by confirming these attributes for its usefulness of 
preference decision [2]. In this way, the desirable rules set 
can be identified grounded on the integration of the objective 
information which the previous extracted rules hold and the 
decision maker’s subjective preference information.  
The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. 
Section ? discusses the extraction of rules based on the 
formal concept analysis. In section ?, the priority sequence 
of these rules will be confirmed according to the given 
preference information. An example is presented in section 
?, followed by the conclusion. 
II. RULES EXTRACTION 
In this section, the basic definitions of concept lattice and 
the processes for extracting rules are described in detail. 
A. Basic Definitions 
 A concept lattice is formed by lots of formal concepts in 
a formal context. A series of definitions of the concept lattice 
theory can be listed as follows [1][3][4] . 
• Definition 1.  A formal context ( , , )K U A R=  
consists of an object setU , an attribute set A , and a 
relation R U A? × . The element x of U is called the 
object, and the element y of A is called the attribute. 
If the object x has the attribute y , it can be written 
as xRy or ( , )x y R? . For X U? and Y A? , we 
define:    ' : { | , }X y A x X xRy= ? ? ?  
' : { | , }Y x U y Y xRy= ? ? ?  
• Definition 2.  Given a pair ( , )C X Y= on the formal 
context ( , , )K U A R= , if ( , )X Y satisfies 
with , , 'X U Y A X Y? ? = and 'Y X= , then 
( , )C X Y=  is called a formal concept, X andY are 
called the extent and the intent of the concept C , and 
the sets of all extents or intents is denoted 
by ( )EX C or ( )IN C , respectively. The set of all 
concepts of the context K is denoted by ( )L K . 
• Definition 3. For any concept
1 1 1( , )C X Y= , 
2 2 2( , ) ( )C X Y L K= ? , the partial ordering relation 
“ ? ” is defined as: 
 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2( , ) ( , ) ( )X Y X Y X X or Y Y? ? ? ? . 
• Definition 4.  A decision formal context is a 
quintuple ( , , , , )M U W S D T= , ( , , )U W S and 
( , , )U D T are the formal context, U is the object 
set, W or D is the attribute set of conditions or 
decision( W D A=? , for the formal 
context ( , , )K U A R= ), respectively; the relations 
S orT satisfy S U W? × orT U D? × . 
• Definition 5.  For a binary formal 
context ( , , )K U A R= , given m objects and n 
attributes, constructing a m n× ( m and n are natural 
number) matrix B which corresponds to the formal 
context, ( 1, 2, ..., ; 1, 2, ..., )ijb i m j n= =  expresses 
the element in ith row and jth column of the 
matrix, 1ijb = , if the object i   has the attribute j ; 
otherwise, 0ijb = . 
• Definition 6.  Given a m n×  matrix B which 
corresponds to the formal context, matrix 'B  
denotes the transpose of B , and a diagonal matrix

attributes), let 'H B B= ? , the element 
( , 1, 2, ..., )ijh i j m= of the matrix means the common 
attributes which the objects i and j have; and 
let { | }ijX x U xRh= ? , then ( , )ijX h is called basic 
concept. 
• Definition 7.  Given the concept set ( )L K , a 
concept ( , ) ( )C X Y L K= ?  is a frequent concept if 
the number of its extent X  is larger than U ?× and 
its intent isn’t null, contrariwise, ( , )X Y is an 
infrequent concept. U  is defined as the total 
number of ( )L K , and ?  is the support threshold 
specified by the user.  
• Definition 8.  Given a formal context ( , , )K U A R=  
and its corresponding ( )L K , the new lattice, 
removed the infrequent concepts (except null 
concept) and corrected the sub/super-concept 
relations, is called Pruned Concept Lattice of the 
context K , denoted as ( )PL K . 
B.  Realization Steps 
In terms of the above definitions of the formal concept 
analysis, the steps of rules extraction for decision making are 
proposed as the figure 1; the particular description of each 
step is as follows: 
1) Creating the matrix B which corresponds to the 
formal context and finding out the basic concept set. 
2)  Building a complete concept lattice in the form of 
Hass Diagram based on the basic concept set.  
a)  Initializing the concept lattice which contains all 
objects, creating the root node of the basic concept ( , )U ? . 
b)  Creating some new nodes of concepts by 
decreasing some objects of their interrelated higher level 
nodes (the parent nodes of the new nodes), and linking the 
new nodes to their parent nodes, i.e., the root node. 
c)  Obtaining some new nodes again by decreasing 
some additional objects of their parent nodes which created 
in the above step, and linking each new node to its 
interrelated parent nodes.  
d) Iterating the step 2.3 until the lattice contains all 
attributes, and creating the bottommost node of the 
concept ( , )A? , ultimately. 
3) Dividing the attribute set of the created concept 
lattice into the attribute sets of conditions and decision. 
4) Finding out the key concepts which contain both 
attributes of condition and decision making and whose 
parent nodes only contain the attributes of condition. 
5) Based on the pruned concept lattice, specifying the 
support threshold ? and the confidence threshold? . 
6) Computing the support i? and confidence i? for each 
edge from the node of the concept ( , )i ix y  to its parent 
node. According to the created concept 
context ( , , )K U A R= , existing the 
concept ( , )i ix y , ( , , 1, 2, ..., )i ix U y A i n? ? =  , the values of 
the support and the confidence are /i ix U? =  and 
/ ( )i i ix p x? = , respectively, where ix , U ,or ( )ip x is 
the number of the objects in the concept ( , )i ix y , in the 
concept context ( , , )K U A R= , or in the parent 
node ( )ip x of the node of the concept ( , )i ix y , respectively.

7) Comparing the support i?  and confidence i? of each 
edge with the specified support and confidence 
threshold ? and? , respectively. If i? ?? and i? ?? , then 
each rule can be extracted based on the edge: given the edge 
from the node of the concept 2 2 2( , )C X Y= to its parent 
node of the concept 1 1 1( , )C X Y= , if 2? ?? and 2? ?? , then 
there exists a association rule: 1 2 1( ) ( ) ( )IN C IN C IN C? ? , 
i.e., 1 2 1Y Y Y? ? . 
Therefore, the association rules based on a concept lattice 
can be extracted. In the next section, the extracted rules are 
ranked by preference decision making. 
III. RULES CONFIRMATION 
In the multiple attributes decision making, the subjective 
information provided by the decision maker can be 
represented by a linguistic judgment matrix and the 
objective information of the alternatives about their 
attributes can be represented by a decision matrix. The 
weights of attributes and raking of alternatives can be 
confirmed by a series of operations of the two matrices. 
644
 Given the linguistic judgment matrix [ ]ijP p n n= × and 
an alternative set { , 1, 2, ..., }iX x i n= = , ijp is the preference 
information provided by the decision maker, it denotes the 
alternatives ix  being compared with the alternative 
jx ( 1, 2, ...,j n= ). If ijp S? , S denotes a previously 
defined linguistic term set, there existing / 2ii tp s= , and 
ij kp s= , ( )ji kNegp s= , ( )Neg i means a negation operator. 
Introducing the concept of linguistic 2-tuple ( , )k ks ? , 
where ks  is a linguistic term and k?  is a numeric value 
representing the symbolic translation. Let [0, ]k t? ?  be the 
result of an aggregation of the indices of a set of labels 
assessed in a linguistic term set S , the 2-tuple that expresses 
the equivalent information to k? is obtained with the 
following function [5]: 
: [0, ] [ 0.5, 0.5)t S? ? × ?

where, ( )round i  is the usual rounding operation. 
And there is always a function 1?? [5], it returns its 
equivalent numerical value from a 2-tuple: 
1
[ 0.5, 0.5) [0, ]: S t?? × ? ?  , 1( , )k k k ks k? ? ??? = + =    (2) 
Based on the above functions of ? and 1?? , the fuzzy 
preference relation matrix [ ]ij n nF f ×=  can be obtained 
from the linguistic judgment matrix [ ]ij n nP p ×= [6]:

Given an alternative set { , 1, 2, ..., }iX x i n= = and an 
attribute set { , 1, 2, ..., }jR r j m= = , n and m are natural 
number, the decision matrix can be denoted 
as [ ] , ( 0)ij n m ijU u u×= ? , where iju means the utility of the 
attribute jr that pertain to the alternative ix . In order to 
measure all attribute values in dimensionless units and 
facilitate inter-attribute comparisons, the decision matrix 
needs to be normalized to get its normalization 
matrix [ ]ij n mV v ×= :

Adopting the additive weighting method, the value ik of 
an alternative ix used to be ranked can be written as: 
1

where 0j? ? ,

 Thus, the fuzzy preference relation ijf of ijp is an 
estimate of the following equation [7]: 
( )/ij i i jf k k k? +    , 1, 2, ...,i j n=                           (7) 
So, the deviation degree between jpi and /( )i i jk k k+ can 
be written as: 
( )ij ij i j id f k k k= + ?                                                 (8) 
According to the equation (8), [6] and [8] constructed 
the following optimization model to assess the attribute 
weights:

Therefore, the value of the alternatives used to be ranked

In this way, the rules extracted in the section ? can be 
seen as the alternatives candidate to be ranked grounded on 
the above approach. 
IV. ILLUSTRACTIVE EXAMPLE 
A proposed radar system for the target recognition is 
presented in which the possible targets are checked to 
confirm their identity. The targets’ tracks generated by a 
radar sensor are the input data which are characterized by 
the attributes of target instantaneous position, speed and 
direction. The target identification is gained through 
comparing some allowed values of thresholds with some 
target parameters. These thresholds are: the maximum speed 
allowed for a target passing in the area under surveillance 
without representing a threat situation, the minimum 
distance allowed between the target position and the bounds 
of the off-limit region. In addition, a Boolean variable 
denoting whether or not the target is approaching the off-
limit region and a state representing War (W) or Peace (P) 
time are used to make the decision. In this way, the target 
identification is classified to three kinds: Neutral (N), 
Suspect (S), and Threat (T) target.

7 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 
The decision control structure of classifying target based 
on logic rules is presented in a decision table, as the table 1. 
In the table 1, the Boolean variable 0 or 1 is used to express 
the objective information about the conditions or actions of 
a decision. It is easy to see that the table 1 takes on the 
decision formal context in concept lattice theory: the rows 
of the table are labeled by objects, columns by attributes; a 
Boolean variable 1 in row x and column y means that the 
object x has the attribute y; the attributes of 
, , , , , , ,a b c d e f g h are the attributes of condition, and the 
attributes of , ,i j k  are the attributes of decision. Therefore, 
some rules can be extracted.  
In terms of the table 1, the matrix B and ? that 
corresponds to the formal context can be obtained, and the 
matrix 'H B B= ? can be computed as: 
0

So, according to the matrix H , a basic concept set can 
be obtained; and a concept lattice representing by the form 
of Hass Diagram can be created, as the figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2: The complete concept lattice 
Finding out the concepts which contain both attributes of 
condition and decision and whose parent nodes only contain 
the attributes of condition. These concepts represented by 
the form of numerical node are the node of (7), (8), (9), 
(10), and (11). The values of the support and confidence of 
the above nodes of concepts are expressed in the table 2. We 
specify the support threshold i? and the confidence 
threshold i?  are 0.25 and 0.5, respectively.

The extracted rules can be displayed in the table 3. In the 
table 3, the rules of R1, R2, and R3 have the same 
646
consequence but different conditions of attributes, so they 
can be ranked grounded on the preference information of 
their attributes given by the decision maker. 
TABLE 3: THE EXTRACTED RULES FROM THE CONCEPT LATTICE 
No. Node Rule Explanation 
R1 (3)?(8) {a}? {j} If during war time, the target is suspect. 
R2 (4)?(9) {e,g}? {j} 
If Approaching the off-limit 
region and Speed is greater 
than threshold, then the target 
is suspect. 
R3 (5)?(10) {c}? {j} If Distance is smaller than threshold, then the target is 
suspect. 
R4 (2)?(7) {c,e}? {k} 
If Distance is smaller than 
threshold and Approaching the 
off-limit region, then the target 
is threat. 
R5 (6)?(11) {b,d}? {i} 
If during peace time and 
Distance is not smaller than 
threshold, then the target is 
neutral. 
Suppose the linguistic judgment matrix P of the three 
rules of R1, R2, and R3 and another rule R4 deriving from the 
rule R1 (in order to satisfy that P  is consistent with the 
decision matrix including four attributes) and the fuzzy 
preference relation matrix F as:

In addition, suppose four attributes of the four rules as: 
U = { 1u  = the state is war, 2u = distance is smaller than 
threshold, 3u = approaching the off-limit region, 4u  = speed 
is greater than threshold}, due to the suspect target, the 
attributes of 1u , 2u , 3u and 4u  are all benefit attributes. 
Suppose the value of each attribute ranges from 0 to 100, so 
the given decision matrix U and its normalization 
matrixV about the above four attributes are as follows: 
100 28 50 30 1 0.1 1/ 6 0
40 100 46 60 0 1 0.1 3/ 7

Based on the equations (10) and (12), the optimum 
weight vector ??  and the value of the rules used to be 
ranked are: 
(0.7163, 0.0556, 0.0815, 0.1466)

Therefore, the ranking order of the three extracted rules 
is 1 3 2R R R; ; . In terms of the extracted rules and the 
ranking consequence of some rules, the decision maker can 
more rationally judge the different effect of different 
condition on the same consequence.  
V. CONCLUSION 
An approach for extracting the association rules of 
human decision making based on the concept lattice created 
from great deal of data is introduced. Furthermore, an 
optimal method is used to confirm the ranking consequence 
of the rules. In this way, both the objective information 
represented by the extracted rules and subjective 
information represented by the decision maker’s preference 
can be considered for human decision making to respond to 
the complex situation, such as time pressure, incomplete 
data, lack of domain knowledge, and so on.
