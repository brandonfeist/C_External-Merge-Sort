Abstract—Support and confidence are two main parameters of 
association rule mining, the first is used to measure the 
statistics importance of association rule, and the second is used 
to measure the reliability of association rule. The quality of 
association rule does not have quantitative evaluation criterion. 
In this paper, Quality index is proposed, the subjective and 
objective aspects are integrated and information theory is 
introduced in order to evaluate multi-level association rule’s 
quality based on domain ontology. The quality index of rule 
can be an important reference in redundancy treatment and 
rule application. Finally, the experiment shows one of the 
applications of quality index in multi-level association rule 
mining and redundancy treatment ontology-based.

I. INTRODUCTION 
There are numbers of strong association rules that meet 
the minimum support and minimum confidence extracted, 
which makes the analysis and application of these rules 
become very difficult. And also some rule’s quality is 
serious: a large number of rules are not the user’s needs; in 
practice, some rules are redundant or overlap and even 
inconsistent with the actual situation; also some rules are too 
general or too detail that does not meet the requirement. A 
new framework is proposed in [1], which combines field 
knowledge with association rule mining, grouping and 
pruning rules. The framework builds a schema of domain 
knowledge combining with the goals and knowledge of user, 
which is contained in database, then prunes and filters rules 
based on rule schema. Reference [2] integrates semantic 
web, divides rule set into five categories: trivial, known and 
correct, unknown and correct, known and incorrect, 
unknown and incorrect, prunes meaningless and useless rules 
for user through semantic analysis. Reference [3] considers 
that lots of redundant and overlap rules are produced during 
association rule mining because of the sparseness of large-
scale high dimensional data. A method using meta-rules to 
divide rules with the same result into separate groups is 
proposed, and then pruning the rule set using meta-rules, the 
article also mention that domain knowledge can be used to 
prune each rule group. The quality of association rules 
should be considered as an important issue. Reference [4] 
propose a new method to evaluate rule quality, a weight 
based on domain knowledge assigned to each property of 
hierarchy concept is needed, the method combines the 
subjective and objective evaluation method, and the result 
can reflect user's interest very well. 
There are objective and subjective methods for rule 
quality evaluation. Objective method is based on statistical or 
machine learning and so on; Subjective evaluation method 
integrates user participation and domain knowledge. The 
objective can not express domain knowledge; Association 
rule mining and quality evaluation solely based on data have 
much shortage in application. User's subjective judgment is 
not enough with the large-scale data, which may produce 
results that are not convincing, or can’t constitute a reliable 
knowledge. Quality index is proposed in this paper, the 
subjective and objective aspects are integrated and 
information theory is introduced in order to quantify multi-
level association rule’s quality based on domain ontology. 
Rules quality index can be used to guide the multi-level 
association rules analysis and redundancy treatment. The 
results can satisfy the precision in objective and the rule’s 
quality also can meet requirement for user application. 
II. RELATE CONCEPTION 
A. Association rule 
Let I= {I1, I2, I3,…,Im} be the attribute set of a database 
called items, and meanwhile each item Ij(1?j?m) is an 
attribute or a concept of ontology. Item set X is the set of 
items, where IX ? .Let T be set of transactions, for each 
transaction ti in T, ti?T and Iti ? .A transaction contains 
an item set X? if and only if itX ? .The support of an 
itemset X is defined as the proportion of transaction in 
dataset which contains the itemset, denoted as 
sup(X).Association rule is defined as an implication of the 
form X?Y ,where IX ? ? IY ? and X?Y=?, the sets of 
items X and Y are called antecedent and consequent of the 
rule respectively. The items in X, Y are the attributes or 
concepts of ontology and can be in different levels. The 
support of a rule is defined as the proportion of transaction 
in a transaction set which contains both itemset X and Y, 
denoted as sup (X?Y). Association rule mining is the 
knowledge discovery process that finds the rules whose 
support and confidence are not less than a given value in 
transaction set. The confidence of a rule is defined as:

B. Ontology and information theory 
The main purpose of ontology is to specify domain 
concepts, define vocabularies and their relationships 
combining with ontology axioms, in order to support 
knowledge sharing and reusing. 
Definition :( Ontology) ontology is a formal, explicit 
specification of a shared conceptualization [5]. ontology can 
be defined as five-tuple O(C, R, H, P, A), where C is the set 
of concepts; R represents all non-hierarchical relationships; 
H represents the hierarchical relationships of ontology, that 
records the information of hierarchical, H (ci,cj) means that 
concept ci is a descendant of cj; P represents attributes of 
concepts and A is the set of ontology axioms. 
We can construct ontology which integrates the domain 
knowledge and prior knowledge, combines with expert 
knowledge and user awareness from dataset. Association rule 
mining can be done under the guidance of ontology; the 
multi-level association rules extracted from ontology meet 
the actual situation and also can express user’s purpose. 
Information theory is the scientific study of measurement 
and transfer of information using mathematical statistics and 
probability theory, based on mathematical explanation of the 
relationship between probability and information 
redundancy. Amount of information and information entropy 
are the two most important concepts in information theory. 
Definition :( Amount of information) If message a occurs 
on the probability pa = n/m, then the information amount of a 
is defined to be: I (a) =- log2 (pa) = log2 (m/n). 
The amount of information expresses the information 
requirement if one selects a state from an equally possible 
event, the less possibility of a message, the more information 
needed to identify the message; in contrast, the more 
possibility of a message, the less information needed to 
identify the message. 
Definition :( Information entropy) If message a occurs on 
the probability pa = n/m, then the information entropy of a is 
defined to be: H (a) =-pa*log2 (pa) =pa*log2 (m/n). 
The information entropy can be looked upon as the 
occurrence probability of a particular event. A special state 
occurring on a higher probability proves that it is spread 
more widely or has higher degree of citation. Information 
entropy can be used to express the value of information in 
terms of information dissemination. 
III. QUALITY EVALUATION OF MULTI-LEVEL 
ASSOCIATION RULE BASED ON ONTOLOGY 
Multi-level association rules contain these rules that are 
extracted from same concept level or different concept 
levels. Generally, the knowledge represented by low-level 
association rules are less general, often have to be 
generalized to higher level. On the other hand, cross-level 
association rules contain higher actual value. The previous 
measures about rule quality evaluation are subjective simply 
or completely based on experiences which are not common 
and strict. We try to develop a new common and strict 
evaluation criterion to evaluate the quality of multi-level 
association rule, integrating domain knowledge and 
mathematic statistics, using subjective and objective 
measures. 
A. Rule quality index 
Domain knowledge can be described by ontology. 
Domain concepts are organized in a directed acyclic graph; 
Figure 1.The associations among concepts are described and 
defined using ontology axioms.  
Theorem 1: High hierarchy concepts are supported by 
low hierarchy concepts, the range of high level concepts is 
the union of their children’s range separately. ?c represents 
the range of concept c (the range is discrete), so the ancestor 
concept’s range ?c=?c1??c2?…??cm?where ci(1?i?
m) is the descendant of c .if the size of ? is n ,then nc?
nc1+nc2+…+ncm? 
 
Figure.1. ontology example 
Normally higher hierarchy concepts are more general, 
sometimes they can’t express information clearly, and user 
couldn’t obtain any definite knowledge. For example, the 
ontology shown in Figure 1, concept Meat is a higher level 
concept, there are numbers of kinds meat, user don’t know 
the meat direct what kind of meat. Contrarily, the lower 
hierarchy concepts express clearer information, such as 
concept Beef show distinct information, it indicate the 
concept represents the beef which is a meat. 
Theorem 2: In the ontology, the higher level the concept 
is, the more abstract meaning they express and the more 
ambiguous its information is; the lower level the concept is, 
the more detailed meaning they express and the clearer its 
information is. 
According to the definition of amount of information, If 
message a occurs on the probability pa = n/m, then the 
information amount of a is: I (a) =- log2 (pa) = log2 (m/n).In 
an ontology, if the range of concept c is ?,with n-values, we 
assume concept c obtains each value with equal probability, 
that’s to say the probability is p(c=ci)=1/n when concept c is 
valued ci(1?i?n).So if we want to make c valued ci, we need 
the amount of information I(c=ci)=-log2(p)=log2(n).We also 
can define the information entropy for each concept belong 
to an ontology like the information entropy in information 
theory to be H(c=ci)=p(c=ci)*I(c=ci).It is can be proved that 
the more diverse of a concept’s value (the greater range ? of 
the concept), the greater amount of information the concept 
171
contain, but the lower information entropy the concept has, 
that’s to say the quality of information of the concept is 
lower, so when we consider to generalize a concept ,the 
quality of concept after generalizing must be considered.  
Theorem 3: They have the same meaning between the 
information quality description of concept based on 
information theory and the hierarchy description of concept 
ontology-based. 
We can infer from Theorem 1 and Theorem 3: 
Inference 1: In ontology, the amount of information of 
a high hierarchy concept isn’t greater than the sum of its 
sub-concept. that is I(c)?I(c1)+I(c2)+…+I(cm),where ci (1
?i?m)is the sub-concept of c. 
Inference 2: In ontology, the information entropy of a 
high hierarchy concept is not greater than any of its sub-
concept. That is H(c)?H(ci),where ci is the sub-concept of 
c. 
Definition :( average information entropy) the average 
information entropy of rule is defined as the average of all 
items’ information entropy in the rule, which is 
k
)item(H
k
0i
i?
=
,where k indications the number of items in 
rule. 
Definition :( quality index) we define the quality index 
equal the average information entropy, the quality index of 
rule r denoted as Q(r). 
Rule’s quality index measures the quality of the 
information contained in the rule, the higher the rule’s 
quality index, the better the quality of the rule. Ordinarily, 
among the association rule, we mainly consider two aspects 
of strong association rule: on the one hand whether the rule 
has practical significance, association rule mining ontology-
based extracts rules under the guidance of domain 
knowledge, the fetched rules can reflect user’s purpose and 
domain significance; on the other hand whether the rule’s 
significance is appropriateness, for this purpose, in most case, 
low-level rules need to be generalized. This paper argues that 
when considering whether to delete the low-level rules or 
generalize rules based on ontology, we should consider the 
quality of the rules after generalized; we must assure the 
rule’s quality and then make the result with the overall 
general. 
B. Utilize quality index 
Rule’s quality index can be used to guide redundancy 
treatment, in order to make rule meet objective requirements 
and the rule’s quality satisfy the user requirements. 
Definition:( quality loss)if the quality index of rule r1 is 
Q(r1)before generalized, then after generalized ,rule r2 is 
generated, whose quality index is Q(r2),we define the 
quality loss l to be:  
%100
)(
)()()(
1
21
21 ×
?
=
rQ
rQrQrrl ?  
According to previous theory, if we generalize rule to 
higher level, may lead to the quality decline. Quality loss 
expresses the information loss after generalized, and is used 
to determine whether to generalize the rules. 
Algorithm 1: 
Input: rule set R; ontology onto; quality loss threshold e 
Output: rule set R’ after processing 
get concept  set C and range ? from Onto 
for c in C begin 
 H(c)=the information entropy of c 
end 
for r in R begin 
 add r to R’ 
 Q(r)=the quality index of r 
 If r can be generalized begin 
  generalize r to r’ 
  Q(r’)=the quality index of r’ 
  l=(Q(r)-Q(r’))/Q(r)*100% 
  if  l?e begin 
delete r from R’ 
calculate confidence for r’ 
              add r’ to R’ 
    end 
 end 
end 
sort R’ according to Q(r) 
IV. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYZE 
The experiment was performed using a census income 
database with 32561 records and 11 attributes. The 
experiment’s purpose is to evaluate the quality of the rule 
for ontology-based multi-level association rule mining, so, 
ontology is extracted from the dataset, and then constructed 
using protégé, Fig.2. The ontology consists of three 
categories: education, personal and work. Attributes and 
concepts related to each category are abstracted. Fig.3 
shows the hierarchy of marital status. 
 
Figure.2.the ontology for census income 
In order to calculate information entropy for each concept 
in ontology, we assume each leaf node’s range is {true, 
false}, this surmise corresponds with the actual situation, 
take Fig.3 for example, the leaf node Divorced, its means 
whether the individual have divorced, this is a binary, and 
other nodes are also in the similar case. According to 
Theorem 1, the abstraction hierarchy concept’s range is the 
union of its descendants’ range. So, we can calculate each 
172
concept’s information entropy, and then calculate the quality 
loss for general rules. 
 
Figure.3.married hierarchy 
We use Algorithm 1 to generalize extracted rules 
which can be generalized. Experimental environment is: 
Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo CPU E7500 @2.93 2.93GHz, 
2.00G memory; Window XP professional OS; open source 
data mining platform weka3.7 is used to mine rules. We set 
support to be 0.1, confidence to be 0.9, quality loss 
threshold e=0.1. There are 1384 strong association rules 
extracted. Table.1 lists part of extracted rules; the quality 
index has been calculated for each rule.

According to ontology, some rule can’t be generalized, 
such as rule 4?6?8?11, there are no item which can be 
generalized in these rules, that proves these items in rule is 
independent individual. According to the quality loss 
threshold set previous, the quality loss of rules 5, 12, after 
generalized, is greater than the threshold, this indicates that 
the generalized rules can not express the exact meaning; 
users can not get meaningful information from the 
generalized rules. Take rule 5 for example, the original rule 
shows that the major person who works on craft-repair is 
male, but, after generalized, its means that who work on 
service is male, obviously, it can’t express the exact meaning 
clearly, to a certain extent, the significance is inaccurate, not 
persuasive, so the rule can not be generalized. The other 
rules like 0?1?3 and so on, can be generalized within the 
acceptable quality loss threshold, these rules after 
generalized still express the significance very clearly, and 
association rules also meet with the general purpose after 
generalized in ontology and domain knowledge. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
This paper introduces information theory and proposes 
rule quality index, which is used to quantify the quality of 
multi-level association rule. Rule’s quality index based on 
domain ontology and information theory, can measure rule 
quality from both subjective and objective aspect.  
Redundancy treatment is an important topic in multi-
level association rule mining. The future work is considering 
rule quality as a parameter during multi-level association rule 
mining ontology-based and rule redundancy treatment.
