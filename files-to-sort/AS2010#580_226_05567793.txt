Abstract—Fault system is a significant evidence of tectonic 
movement during crust tectonic evolution and may play an more 
important role in oil-gas accumulation process than other 
tectonic types in sedimentary basin. Carboniferous surface faults 
in Junggar Basin developed well and varied in size and 
distribution. There are about 200 faults in Carboniferous, and 
187 of them are thrust faults. Chaos-fractals theories have been 
widely investigated and great progress has been made in the past 
three decades. One of the important conception-fractal dimension 
had become a powerful tool for describing non-linearity 
dynamical system characteristic. The clustered objects in nature 
are often fractal and fault system distribution in space is 
inhomogeneous, always occurs in groups, so we can describe 
spatial distribution of faults from the point of fractal dimension. 
Fractal dimension of fault system is a comprehensive factor 
associated with fault number, size, combination modes and 
dynamics mechanism, so it can evaluate the complexity of fault 
system quantitatively. The relationship between fault system and 
oil-gas accumulation is a focus and difficulty problem in 
petroleum geology, and fractal dimension is a new tool for 
describing fault distribution and predicting potential areas of 
hydrocarbon resources. Geographic Information System (GIS) is 
a kind of technological system collecting, storing, managing, 
computing, analyzing, displaying and describing the geospatial 
information supported by computer software and hardware. In 
the last 15-20 years, GIS have been increasingly used to address a 
wide variety of geoscience problems. Weights-of-evidence models 
use the theory of conditional probability to quantify spatial 
association between fractal dimension and oil-gas accumulation. 
The weights of evidence are combined with the prior probability 
of occurrence of oil-gas accumulation using Bayes’rule in a log-
linear form under an assumption of conditional independence of 
the dimension maps to derive posterior probability of occurrence 
of oil-gas accumulation. In this paper, we first vectorize the fault 
system in Carboniferous of Junggar Basin in GIS software and 
store it as polyline layer in Geodatabase of GIS to manage and 
analyze, then calculate the fractal dimension of three types which 
are box dimension, information dimension and cumulative length 
dimension using spatial functions of GIS, in the last use weights-
of-evidence model to calculate the correlation coefficients in GIS 
environment between oil-gas accumulation and three types of 
fractal dimension in order to quantity the importance of fault 
system.

I. INTRODUCTION 
As tectonic features remained by tectonic movements, 
fault system was a prominent sign of contrary movements in 
tectonic evolution processes. In sedimentary basins, fault 
system played a more important role compared with other 
tectonic styles and because of its universality, periodicity, 
inheritance, difference and gradation, there was a certain link 
between fault system and genesis, distribution of the oil and 
gas [1]. The fault system of Carboniferous in Junggar Basin 
developed well and varied in distribution and size. There are 
more than 200 Carboniferous faults in Junggar Basin whose 
types are thrust fault, back fault and flushes fault. The 
characteristics of the fault development period are very 
obvious, and the different tectonic movements effected 
differently on the fault development and on the fault 
distribution [2]. The relationship between faults and oil-gas 
resource accumulation process was a hot and difficult problem 
in recent years, but there were few methods and techniques of 
studying faults inside the basin especially in semi-quantitative 
and quantitative ways.   
Geographic Information System (GIS) is a kind of 
technological system collecting, storing, managing, computing, 
analyzing, displaying and describing the geospatial information 
supported by computer software and hardware [3]. In the last 
15-20 years, GIS have been increasingly used to address a wide 
variety of geoscience problems. As one of the greatest natural 
science discoveries of the 20th century, chaos-fractals theories 
have been widely investigated and great progress has been 
made in the past three decades. Geology is one of the most 
active fields using fractal geometry to study relevant problems, 
such as the processing technique for high-resolution 3-D 
seismic data [4], description of reservoir heterogeneity [5], 
DSS for oil exploration and development [6] and so on. 
Evidence weight method was first presented by Bonham-Carter 
and Agterberg which used statistical analysis pattern and took 
the Bayes conditional probabilities as base [7]. It regarded 
every geology factor influenced oil and gas evolution as 
evidence and computed the weight of every evidence which 
defined its contribution to oil and gas prediction.  
This paper tried to study the fault system of 
Carboniferous in Junggar Basin used fractal theory and 
weights-of-evidence model based on GIS. First it vectorized 
the fault system of Carboniferous in Junggar Basin and stored 
it as polyline layer in Geodatabase of GIS to manage and 
analyze, then calculated the fractal dimension of three types 
which are box dimension, information dimension and 
cumulative length dimension using spatial functions of GIS, in 
the last used weights-of-evidence model to compute the 
correlation coefficients in GIS environment between oil-gas 
accumulation and three types of fractal dimension in order to 
quantity the importance of fault system. 
II. FRACTAL DIMENSION OF FAULT SYSTEM  
A. Overview of Fractal Theory  
As one of the greatest natural science discoveries of the 
20th century, fractal theories have been widely investigated and 
great progress has been made in the past three decades. One of 
the important conception which is fractal dimension had 
become a powerful tool for describing non-linearity dynamical 
system characteristic. As Feder points out, clustered objects in 
nature are often fractal. Clustering, or the aggregation of matter 
in space, defines the concentration or density of matter. 
Because clustering is the dominant characteristic of the spatial 
arrangement of fault system, we can describe spatial 
distribution of faults from a fractal point. The value of fractal 
dimension to fault system is a comprehensive index which 
describes the number, size, combination and dynamical 
mechanism of fault system, so it can be considered as a 
quantitative factor to complexity of fault system [8]. Generally, 
fault system had higher values of fractal dimension where 
fracture length was longer, rock fragmentation is bigger, more 
small and branch faults, high structure amplitude, intense 
structure deformation, otherwise, the fault system had lower 
value of fractal dimension. 
B. Three Types and Formulas of Fractal Dimension in Fault 
System  
1) Box dimension: It is used widely because of its simple 
computational method [9]. First, the total study area is divided 
into even and continuous square grid with sides of r, then we 
record the number of squares containing fault lines partly or 
totally which is denoted as N(r). Second, repeat the step above 
with the square sides reduced to r/2, r/4, r/8… until approached 
zero and we can define the box dimension as D1: 
                D1=- )lg(/)(lglim
0
rrN
r?
.                              (1) 
Because in practice we can only take finite sides of 
square, people usually draw fractal plot diagrams which the 
ordinate represents the number(N) and the abscissa represents 
the size of length(r) of square side and then get the box 
dimension from slope of lgN—lgr line. 
2) Information dimension: The chief weakness of counting 
number of not empty squares to calculate the fractal dimension 
is that the dimension does not reflect the nonuniformity of 
geometry objects because the square containing one fault is 
important as the square containing more than one fault. We 
number every square with i=1,2…n, and if the ith box has Ni(r) 
faults falling into, the probability(Pi) of faults falling into ith 
box is given by: Pi=Ni(r)/N(r), where N(r) is total number of 
faults falling into all boxes. Last according to the information 
formula: I(r)=-?
=
n
i
ii rPrP
1
)(lg)( , where n is the total number of 
boxes, and we can define the information dimension D2 as 
follows:   
                      D2=- )lg(/)(lim
0
rrI
r?
                                  
(2) 
3) Cumulative length dimension. Compared with direction, 
density and distribution of fault system, the analysis of length 
can obtain more information. On the basis of previous work, 
there is a fractal relation between cumulative number of fault 
line and fault length as follows [10]: 
                       M(r)=Cr-D3                                              (3) 
Where M(r) is the number of faults whose length is 
longer than r, D3 is the cumulative length dimension, C is a 
constant.  
C. Calculating Fractal Dimensions Based on GIS  
The advantages of GIS include its database manner of 
data management, its capability to overlay and integrate 
different spatial information, and its powerful tools and 
functions for image analysis, spatial analysis and modeling. So 
it is suitable for GIS to extract and manage the fault system and 
compute the fractal dimensions. 
The overlay toolset in ArcGIS contains tools to combine, 
erase, modify or update multiple feature classes to spatial 
features in a new feature class. New information is created 
when overlaying one set of features with another. There are six 
types of overlay operations; all involve joining two existing 
sets of features into a single set of features to identify spatial 
relationships between the input features. The intersect tool 
calculates the geometric intersection of any number of feature 
class and feature layers. The features or portion of features 
which are common to (intersect) all inputs will be written to the 
output feature class. 
The length of every fault line is stored as a basic field in 
layer of GIS geographical database automatically after 
vectorization, so we can compute the cumulative length 
dimension of fault system by using (3) easily and the result is 
showed in Fig2(c). Calculating box dimension and information 
dimension of fault system took four steps. First, the total study 
area should be divided into squares with sides(r) of 80km, then 
all square area layers overlaid with fault line layer by using 
intersect function of GIS and we can obtain a new layer as a 
result. Secondly, opening the attribute table of new layer, we 
record the number of squares which contain fault lines partly or 
totally and calculate the length of those lines. Third, repeat the 
steps above with the square sides changed to 40km(r/2), 
20km(r/4), 10km(r/8) and 5km(r/16). Last drawing fractal plot 
diagrams which the ordinate represents the number(N) and 
information(I) of squares and the abscissa represents the size of 
length(r) of square side and then we can see there are obvious 
linear relationship in double logarithmic plots from Fig2a, 
Fig2b, so we get three fractal dimensions: D1=1.43, D2=1.48, 
D3=1.79.

The value of fractal dimension to fault system is a 
comprehensive index which describes the number, size, 
combination and dynamical mechanism of faults, so we can 
obtain different fractal dimension value in different place of 
study region. Because three fractal dimension values what we 
calculated above are just suitable for total research area, in 
order to better study the relationship between fractal dimension 
and oil-gas resources distribution in every place, we compute 
three fractal dimension values of every 80km side squares to 
interpolate three thematic maps of study area showed in Fig3. 
From Fig2 and Fig3 we can see that fractal dimension obtained 
by different methods are different in the same place and there is 
a good correlation between higher fractal dimension value and 
complexity of fault system. The areas which have higher three 
fractal dimension values lie in the middle and east region and 
those places also have maximum fault density and length.

III. USING WEIGHTS-OF-EVIDENCE MODEL TO COMPUTE 
CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS AND RANK THE IMPORTANCE OF 
FAULT ATTRIBUTES 
The weights-of-evidence model’s principle and its 
explanation to evidence of geology factors are simple and it is 
easy to realize. Moreover, it can deal with areas which lose 
information. The difference between positive and negative 
weight of geology evidence show the importance of indicating 
oil-gas accumulation.  
In oil and gas resource assessment, the spatial relationship 
between geology evidence and oil-gas resources distribution 
can be calculated from ratio of related regional area:   
        P(d)=S(d)/A?P(ej?d)=[S(d)?S(ej)]/S(d)]

Where d stands for appearances of oil-gas resources while 
e1,e2,…,en stands for appearances of geology evidence, both d 
and ej are layers stored in GIS. A is area of total study region, 
S(d) is total area of oil-gas resources while S(ej) is total area of 
ej. ¬ d stands for disappearance of oil-gas resources while 
¬ ej stands for disappearance of j evidence. If overlaying oil-
gas resources layers with j geology evidence layers, there are 
four results which are ej ? d, ¬ ej ? d, ej ? ¬ d and 
¬ ej? ¬ d, so we can define four corresponding conditional 
probabilities as follows: 
P(d?ej)= S(ej? d)/S(ej) 
P( ¬ d?ej)= S(ej? ¬ d)/S(ej) 
P(d?¬ ej)= S( ¬ ej? d)/S( ¬ ej) 
P( ¬ d?¬ ej)= S( ¬ ej? ¬ d)/S( ¬ ej) 
The positive and negative weight of j geology evidence can 
be defined as W j+  and W j
? : 
W j+ =ln P(ej?d)/ P(ej?¬ d)? 
W j? = ln P( ¬ ej?d)/ P( ¬ ej?¬ d) 
The correlation coefficients between j geology evidence 
and oil-gas resources distribution is C j , and can be given by:  
C j =W j
+ -W j?  
In the terms of oil and gas resources assessment, the higher 
the value of Cj is, the closer the link is between the geology 
evidence and oil-gas resources appearance and the bigger 
contribution is to oil-gas exploration. So Cj can be used as an 
indicator showing importance of geology evidence.  
To some extent the attributes of fault system affect and 
limit the spatial distribution of oil and gas resource, so they can 
be considered as the geology evidences. Every attribute of fault 
system plays a different role in hydrocarbon accumulation and 
we can use weights-of-evidence model to compute correlation 
coefficients and rank the importance of every fault attribute. 
According to the weights-of-evidence model, we used overlay 
analysis between fault attribute layer and oil-gas resource layer 
based on GIS to get correlation coefficient of every fault 
attribute in Tab1. Take correlation coefficients of cumulative 
length dimension for an example, we use intersect function in 
GIS to obtain the intersection of oil-gas resource layer and 
cumulative length dimension layer of fault system showed in 
Fig4 and compute the correlation coefficient as follows: 
W + =ln P(e?d)/ P(e?¬ d)=ln( 300283/130180
4918/2922 )=0.3 
W ? = ln P( ¬ e?d)/ P( ¬ e?¬ d)=ln( 300283/170103
4918/1996 ) 
=-0.3 
C =W + -W ? =0.6 
 
Figure 3.  Using intersect function in GIS to calculate the correlation coefficient of cumulative length dimension.
From the result in Tab1 we can draw a conclusion that 
distribution of faults covers a small area but it is most 
important and most effective because the value of correlation 
coefficient is highest(c=2.6). Density, information dimension, 
length and box dimension of fault system are in close relation 
with oil-gas accumulation while cumulative length dimension 
and connectivity of fault system have some relation with oil-
gas accumulation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
There is a good correlation between higher fractal 
dimension value and complexity of fault system. Generally, 
fault system had higher values of fractal dimension where 
fracture length was bigger, more small and branch faults, high 
structure amplitude, intense structure deformation. Otherwise, 
the fault system had lower value of fractal dimension. 
Fractal dimension obtained by different methods are 
different and have different meanings in the same place. In this 
paper we calculated the fractal dimension of three types which 
are box dimension, information dimension and cumulative 
length dimension using spatial functions of GIS,  in the last use 
weights-of-evidence model to calculate the correlation 
coefficients between oil-gas accumulation and three types of 
fractal dimension in order to quantity the importance of fault 
system. 
According to the correlation coefficients calculated by 
weights-of-evidence model we can know that distribution of 
faults covers a small area but it is most important and most 
effective because the value of correlation coefficient is 
highest(c=2.6). Density, information dimension, length and box 
dimension of fault system are in close relation with oil-gas 
accumulation while cumulative length dimension and 
connectivity of fault system have some relation with oil-gas 
accumulation.  
The advantages of GIS include its database manner of data 
management, its capability to overlay and integrate different 
spatial information, and its powerful tools and functions for 
image analysis, spatial analysis and modeling. Thus, it well 
suited for extracting, manipulating, and analyzing fault system 
information. In GIS software we can analyze and deal with 
fault system quickly and effectively using overlay functions of 
GIS spatial analysis.
