I. INTRODUCTION
Market basket analysis is a good way to provide 
scientific decision support for retail market by mining 
association relationships among items people purchased 
together[1]. Mining results may not be interesting to people 
since they don’t show semantic associations among items. 
However, the consequence may be different if association 
rules are mined on items’ internal characteristics. In this 
paper, we propose an innovative market basket analysis 
method by mining association rules on items’ internal 
characteristics which are obtained by using automatic words 
segmentation technology.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 
II reviews the general architecture of the market basket 
analysis system. Section III describes the proposed method 
to get association relationships between items themselves by 
using item characteristic association rules. Section IV 
demonstrates the effectiveness of the method through three 
different experiments. Section V concludes the paper. 
II THE MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS SYSTEM 
ARCHITECTURE 
Generally, the historical retail database is huge and the 
time complexity of the association rule mining is high. 
Therefore, real-time data mining is unpractical and it is 
much better to establish the market basket analysis system 
by applying the Client/Server architecture (Figure 1). The 
roles of client and server in the architecture are as follows. 
Figure 1. The Market Basket Analysis System Architecture 
Server: generate characteristics automatically for each 
item by using word segmentation technology; mine item 
characteristic association rules and store the set of rules in 
database.
Client: receive a set (sequence) of items and read the 
item characteristic association rules; return a set of items

which is strongly associated to the received set (sequence). 
A typical use of this market basket analysis system is 
that in a restaurant equipped with electronic ordering system, 
consumers can get scientific recommendations after each 
step of ordering dishes with this system. 
III. ASSOCIATION RULE ANALYSIS
 After having mined the item characteristic association 
rules, we introduce methods of how to find a set of items 
that is strongly associated to a certain set (sequence) of 
items when a client receives a request. 
A. On Condition That the Request Format is a Set of 
Items 
 Because the request formats (set or sequence) received 
by clients are different, the method used to calculate a set of 
items which is strongly associated to the request is different 
as well. While the request format is a set of items, it will be 
much simple. 
Suppose A is a set of items described as follows:{??
????? (Hongshaoniurougaijiaofan)}, and the item 
characteristic association rules are: 
{???}== >{?} [sup = 0.1; conf= 0.8] 
{?????}==>{??} [sup= 0.15; conf= 0.6] 
The corresponding meaning for the second association 
rule is: Among all the consumers who ordered dishes with
??(Niurou) and??(Hongshao), 60% of them ordered 
dishes with??(Jidan) as well. This is supported by 15% of 
the whole trading records. The first rule can be rendered 
similarly. 
Because item “ ? ? ? (Jidantang)” contains 
characteristics ? (Tang) and ? ? (Jidan) which are 
strongly associated to the characteristics of items in set A, 
we can make a qualitative decision that item “???
(Jidantang)” is strongly associated to the given set. 
How to determine another set of items B to make sure 
that every item in set B is strongly associated to set A when 
market basket analysis system receives a set of items A? 
Obviously, a quantitative method to measure the strength of 
association relationship between set of items A and any 
other item is needed. 
A new concept is introduced for this purpose: Similarity 
(g,A,p). Here, g represents a certain item, and A represents a 
certain set (sequence) of items, p represents a certain 
association rule. Similarity (g,A,p) is used to measure the 
similarity between the process of “recommend p.second 
according to p.first” and the process of “recommend item g 
according to a set (sequence) of items A” quantitatively. 
Similarity(g,A,p) is calculated as Equation(1):  
Similarity(g,A,p) = (|p.first ?G  characteristics in A|  
* |p.second ?G characteristics in g|)  
/ (|p.first| * |p.second|).        (1)           
To any set of items A and any item g which is excluded 
from set A, the strength of association relationship between 
g and A can be defined as function Elem_t Relation(A,g), 
the pseudo code is: 
Elem_t Strength_set(A, g){ 
Elem_t ret = 0; 
    For_each(p in P) 
ret=ret+p.strength*Similarity(g,A,p); 
return ret; 
}
Here is the description of variable names and symbols: 
P: a set of item characteristic association rules; 
p: an item characteristic association rule; 
p.first: antecedents of association rule p; 
p.second: consequent of association rule p; 
p.strength: strength of rule p, generally, represented by 
the confidence of the rule. 
B? On Condition That the Request Format is a Sequence 
of Items  
When a client receives a sequence of items S, S can be 
considered as a sequence of items a consumer purchased. 
What a market basket analysis system should do is to 
forecast consumers’ purchasing behavior and give scientific 
suggestions. 
Suppose S is a sequence of items, Snext is a new 
sequence which is generated by inserting a new item in the 
end of S. What the system should do next is to obtain a new 
set of items B that is strongly associated to sequence Snext.  
Define a sequence Spre, of which S is generated by 
inserting a new item in the end. Define two sets of 
association rules C and D. C is made up of those association 
310
rules which have at least one characteristic in antecedent 
that exists in sequence Spre. D is made up of those 
association rules which have at least one characteristic in 
antecedent that exists in sequence S. It is obvious that C is a 
subset of D. 
Consider following two calculating processes: 
Process 1: Client receives a sequence of items Spre, set 
of association rules C plays a role in the process of 
generating set of items B. 
Process 2: Client receives a sequence of items S, set of 
association rules D plays a role in the process of generating 
set of items B. 
In the second process, set D-C is more important than 
set C because set C has been considered in process 1.  
Another concept is introduced: Weight (p,S). For a 
certain sequence S and two different association rules p1 
and p2, “Weight(p1,S) > Weight(p2,S)” is true when and 
only when p1 is more important in the process of generating 
set B. 
To calculate Weight (p,S), a function f(x) which is 
monotonically increasing in natural numbers is necessary. 
Typically, f(x) can be defined as “f(x) = x * x * x”. 
Weight(p,S) can be calculated as follows: 
Elem_t Weight(p,S){  
 Elem_t sum = 0, t = 0; 
for_each(attribute in p.first){ 
for (i = 1; i <= S.size(); i++){ 
if (attribute is in S[i]){ 
       sum+=i; t++; 
}
}
}
if (time==0) return 0; 
return f(sum / time); 
}
Similarly, when the request format is sequence of  
items, to any sequence of items S and any item g which is 
excluded from sequence S, the strength of association 
relationship between g and S can be defined as function 
Elem_t Strength_sequence(A,g), the pseudo code is shown 
as follows: 
Elem_t Strength_sequence(A,g){ 
Elem_t ret = 0; 
For_each(p in P) 
ret = ret + p.strength * Weight(p) * 
Similarity(g,S,p); 
return ret; 
}
So far, we can use a quantitative way to measure the 
strength of association relationship between any item g and 
a set (sequence) of items S. Set of items B can be obtained 
by selecting items which are highly associated to the set of 
items A(sequence of items S) according to the practical 
situation. It is regarded that there is certain association 
relationship between set of items A (sequence of items S) 
and set of items B. 
IV EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS OF THE 
RESULTS 
Three groups of data mining experiments were done 
on a given huge historical sales database which is obtained 
from a restaurant with 12613 trading records. We set 
minimum support to 0.01 and minimum confidence to 0.1. 
Results of the experiments are analyzed in the end of this 
section. 
A. First Experiment 
The object of data mining in this experiment is the 
original transaction database which contains 722 kinds of 
goods and 63425 sale records including large numbers of 
fruits and drinks. 119 association rules are obtained in this 
experiment. 
Here are 5 association rules with highest confidence. 
Format of the rules is: Antecedents of association rule, 
Antecedents count ==> Consequent of association rule, 
Consequent count [confidence of the rule]. 
1) ??-????? 148 ==> ??-??? 139 
[conf=0.94] 
2) ??-??? ??-???? 154 ==> ??-?
? 128 [conf=0.83] 
3) ??-???? 316 ==> ??-?? 258 
[conf=0.82 ] 
4) ??-?????? ??-???? 204 ==> 
311
??-?? 166 [conf=0.81] 
5) ??-??? ??-?? 163 ==> ??-???
? 128 [conf=0.79]  
The advantage of this experiment is that most of 
association rules have high support and confidence.  
The disadvantage is that most items in association rules 
are fruits and drinks which policy makers and consumers 
are not interested in. Moreover, the process of data mining 
lasts too long. 
Why are most items in the antecedents and consequents 
of association rules not mainstream food? The reason is that 
there are only limited kinds of fruits and drinks in database, 
thus it is at a high probability that consumers buy a certain 
set of fruits and drinks. This kind of biased data in database 
seriously affects the quality of data mining. 
Another question is how to save time in the process of 
data mining. Time complexity of discovering association 
rules in a frequent item-set is an exponential function whose 
parameter is the rank of the frequent item-set. So removing 
uninterested data can help to save time in the process of data 
mining. 
B. Second Experiment 
The object of data mining in the second experiment is 
the transaction database after the process of data cleaning in 
which non-interest data is removed. In the cleaned database, 
there are 377 kinds of goods and 30156 sale records. 71 
association rules are discovered in the process of data 
mining on cleaned database. 
Here are 5 association rules with highest confidence: 
1) ???? 66 ==> ????? 24 [conf=0.36]  
2) ????? 90 ==>????? 29 [conf=0.32]  
3) ???????  83 ==> ??????  24 
[conf=0.29]  
4) ????? 145 ==> ??? 38 [conf=0.26]  
5) ???? 135 ==> ????? 34 [conf=0.25]  
The advantage of this experiment is that most items in 
data mining result are mainstream food. Time cost of the 
data mining is greatly reduced compared to the first 
experiment. 
The disadvantage is that only a small part of the whole 
items exist in data mining result. It is hard to get a 
reasonable explanation for association rules.    
A question raised from the experiment is whether there 
are any similar association rules. Support and confidence of 
most association rules in this experiment are both low 
because of similar food in menu. Different rules may reflect 
same features in consumers’ buying behavior, e.g., rule “?
?? 115 ==> ????? 28 [conf=0.24]” and rule “?
?? 166 ==> ????? 32 [conf=0.19]”. One feature 
they both reflect is if one consumer choose goods? (Yu), 
the consumer will probably choose??? (Sijidou) next. 
There are some association rules with high confidence but 
low support which can not be obtained by association rule 
mining algorithm but show similar feature in consumers’ 
buying behavior which obtained rules reflect.   
Item characteristic association rules such as “whoever 
likes hot food may also like soup” can not be obtained in 
traditional market basket analysis method. This kind of rules 
will be obtained directly in the third experiment. 
C. Third experiment 
In this experiment, characteristics of each item are 
generated by taking ICTCLAS as the tool of word 
segmentation and taking catering lexicon together with daily 
words as segmentation lexicon before mining association 
rules on the items’ internal characteristics[5].  
Before the process of data mining, the trading record 
which is in the format of a set of items must be transformed 
into the format of a set of items’ characteristics. A piece of 
trading record is represented as { ID1,{G1?G2?……?Gm}}, 
when ID1 is record number,{G1?G2?……?Gm}is the set 
of items people purchased together. Item Gi has ni 
characteristics, the set of characteristics belong to Gi is 
{Gi-1?Gi-2?……?Gi-ni}. After be transformed into a set 
of items’ characteristic, the trading record is represented as 
{ ID1,{ G1-1?G1-2?……?G1-n1,G2-1?G2-2?……?
G2-n2?G3-1?……?Gm-1?Gm-2?……?Gm-nm}}. If 
there are same characteristics in the transformed record, 
only one of them is retained. 
There are 1873 pieces of association rules obtained in 
the third experiment. Some of the prominent item 
characteristic association rules are listed as follows: 
1) ? ?? 277 ==> ? 231 [conf=0.83]  
312
2) ? ? 533 ==> ?? 389 [conf=0.73]  
3) ? ? 473 ==> ?? 339 [conf=0.72]  
4) ? ?? 348 ==> ? 246 [conf=0.71]  
5) ? ? 317 ==> ? 224 [conf=0.71]  
The advantage of this experiment is that the number of 
association rules is huge; most items have at least one 
characteristic which is in the experiment result. Association 
rules which can be explained easily can reflect the essence 
of customers’ buying behavior. 
The disadvantage is that if the name of item can not 
reflect its characteristics, then the method is useless, e.g. 
“????  (Mayishangshu)”. 
D. Experiment Conclusion 
Experiment results were shown in Table 1.

Association rule mining method used in the third 
experiment can obtain association rules with higher support 
and confidence. With same minimum support and 
confidence, the third experiment results in much more 
association rules than the first two experiments with less 
time cost. If the time cost in the process of word 
segmentation is not considered, time cost in the third 
experiment is the least. The experiment results show that a 
large number of association rules can be obtained with the 
innovative market basket analysis method. In the cases 
where the traditional analysis method cannot obtain enough 
association rules that policy makers are interested in, the 
innovative market basket analysis method can provide more 
scientific decision support for retail market and consumers’ 
buying behavior. 
?CONCLUSIONS 
We know that in some cases, market basket analysis 
does not provide useful information if data-item of the 
market basket analysis is the name of goods. In this paper, 
we proposed a new market basket analysis method which 
integrates words segmentation technology and association 
rule mining technology. Characteristics of items can be 
generated automatically before mining association rules by 
using word segmentation technology. This method has been 
applied to a restaurant equipped with electronic ordering 
system to give recommendations to customers, where the 
experiments were done. The experiment results show that 
the method is efficient and valid.
