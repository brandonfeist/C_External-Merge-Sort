I. INTRODUCTION 
Higher Education undertakes the mojore task of 
training highly qualified specialistsdepveloping 
science&technology culture and promoting modernization. 
Improve the quality is a core mission of the development 
of higher education development, and it is the basic 
requirements of constructing our higher education. 
National Program for long-term reform and development 
which Will be implemented puts forward, the level of 
higher education will get further improvement and the 
gross enrollment rate of 40% up to 2020. How to guide 
students to study especially how to guide students who 
failed more elective the courses is one of the difficulties 
and focal points for college student work. Currently most 
universities make the Students of education management 
develop in the direction of "standardization, information 
technology, network" with modem information 
technology, MIS applicate in student management& 
educational management have been rolled out 
continuously. The database has been accumulating more 
and more data. But Most of these data is currently only 
used for simple report and statistical analysis in routine 
work, and many important information and rules 
hiddenning behind. The use of data mining technology can 
quickly and accurately extract valuable but often been 
overlooked information or rules from the vast data 
resources. 
Data mining is the process of extracting useful 
information and knowledge which potentially from the 
vast, incomplete, noisy, ambiguous data, and it Statistics, 
analysis, synthesis and reasoning the data from micro to 
macro, guides to solve practical problems, finds the links 
between things and then makes predictions[l). In this 
paper, it makes use of the decision tree and the rough set 
algorithm in the data mining to extract the Characteristics 
of the data in educational system, and then generate 
forecast and classification models according to the system

characteristics, in order to find the real reason that 
affecting students mark and the association rules among 
failing courses and be good for helping guide students in 
course selection. 
II. DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY 
Data mining extracts information and knowledge that 
people interested in appling a series of technology from 
large databases or data warehouse. These knowledge or 
information is implied, unknown in advance and useful 
potentially, the knowledge expresses as the concepts, rules, 
laws, models and so on[2). 
The association analysis is a key of data mining. The 
values among two or more items exist some regularities, 
called association, so can establish the association rules. 
One of the property value can be predicted based on other 
attribute values If there are links between two or more 
attributes. 
The association rules mining in Data mining is a 
multi-stage process. It can be divided into three main 
stages generally: Data Preparation, Data Mining, 
Expression and Interpretation of the results. 
A. Data preparation 
This process can be further divided into three 
sub-steps[3] : Data Selection, Data Processing, Data 
Transformation. Data Selection Select mainly means of 
extracting relevant data from existing database or data 
warehouse to form Target Data. Data Pre-Processing deals 
with the extracted data, so that can conform to the 
requirements of data mining. The main purpose of data 
transformation is to eliminate data dimension, which is 
finding out the truly useful features from the initial 
characteristics to reduce the features or the number of 
variables to consider when doing data mining. 
B. Data mining 
This section is mainly about planning algorithms, that 
is select one algorithm for the selected mining methods, 
which influences the quality of the mining model directly. 
We can run data mining algorithms after selecting the 
algorithm method. It's one of the Most concerned section 
the data mining analysis and Experts in related fields care 
about, which can also be called the truly data mining. 
C. Stage of expression and interpretation of the results 
According to end-user decision-making purposes to 
analysis the information extraction, distinguish the most 
valuable information, and then get the expressions that 
user can understand and accept. 
III. BUILDING DATA MINING MODEL 
This article is mainly mining and analyzing the case 
?bout the courses students do not pass, and getting its 
mherent potential rules, Thence through query statistics in 
the Educational System, Summary the information table of 
students' all fail courses (compulsory), based on this build 
the model. 
A. Data Preparation 
Query the student achievements in a database and 
access to get the basic data of Coursescore, whi?h is 
shown as following: 
Select * from CourseScore where 
CourseScore.courseType = '1' and CourseScore.score 
< 60 
. Where CourseScore is student transcript, courseType 
IS course character, score is course score. 
At .the same . time, follow the steps of data mining, 
ex?ra?tmg cleanmg and checking the required data, 
bmldmg data warehouse tables and views, the table 
structures are as follows:

provI.des aSSOCIatIOn rules algorithm [4 Jin data mining 
solutIons. The association algorithm explains the rules 
generated by the algorithm using two parameters (support 
and probability). The parameter support called the 
"correlation", which controls the number of itemsets that 
can be generated, parameter probability called 
"confidence", which controls the number of rules can be 
generated. 
At the same time describe the importance of rules 
using the parameter importance mportance: 
If importance(A,B) ? 1, A and B are two independent 
801 
or negatively related cases, that means course A and 
course B are two separate programs, less likely to 
interact each other; 
If iI?portance(A,B) > 1, A and B have a positive 
correlatIOn, means that courses A and course B must exist 
the interaction relationship. 
The calculation process of parameter importance is 
shown as follows: 
Importance (A, B) = probability (A, B)/ (probability 
(A) * probability (B)) (1) 
The setting of all other parameters as follows:

c. Rule Mining&Results Analysis 
To a school from 2008 to 2009 academic base on the 
students achievement data of some univesary in the years 
of 2008 to 2009, through the processing of 3.1 and 3.2, 
and carry out in Microsoft SQLserver2005 Analysis 
services (SSAS), we get the results shown as follows: 
The failure courses in foundation concentrated in the 
cous?s of Advanced Mathematics (1021 students), College 
p?ysIcs(786 students), Probability Theory(744 students), 
Lmear Algebra(603), Fundamentals of Circuit Analysis 
and El?ctrotechnical (the number together is 594), 
Mechamcs of Construction( 408), College English( 415), 
College Physics Experiment and Advanced Programming 
Language C Experiment total is 421 students the number 
of failure courses in Liberal arts is 108 which is much 
fewer. 
The simple analysis of the relationship between several 
categories of students and courses is as follows: 
(l)Failed course credits accumulated more than 25 
students: The possibility of failing the mathematics 
courses is 100%, College Physics 100%, College English 
80%,Basic major Courses 100%, Experimental courses is 
more than 80%, Liberal arts courses is more than 60%. 
(2)Students' failed course credits accumulated are 15 
to 25: Failed courses focus on the courses Mathematics, 
College Physics, College English and some basic major 
courses. 
(3)Students' failed course credits accumulated are 5 to 
15: Failed courses focus on the courses Mathematics, 
College Physics, College English and some basic major 
courses. 
(4) Curriculum Relevance: if failed in Mathematics, 
the possibility of failuring in College Physics and Linear 
Algebra is more than 60%; If failured in Advanced 
Mathematics and Linear Algebra, the possibility of 
failuring in College Physics is more than 80%; if failed 
in College English and the make-up, the possibility of 
failuring in Advanced Mathematics and College Physics 
is 100% 
IV. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MINING RESULTS AND 
GUIDING OF COURSE SELECTION 
Form the mining results we can easly know that the 
students' grasping level of courses' fundamental 
knowledge and study attitudes for same kind of courses 
have relationship to courses score. It is important that how 
students are guided to choose courses for having solid 
basic. Before fundamental knowledge has not reached a 
certain level it has less possibility that students can learn 
802 
any courses or have a high score. So we must enhance the 
understanding of curriculum of appropriate professional. 
We can guide contrapuntally students to choose courses 
that can avoid the consequence cursed by blindy 
course-selecting though fully know the relationship among 
courses. 
V. CONCLUSION 
There are many factors affecting student performance. 
The traditional analysis of students' achievement generally 
concerned only the mean, variance ,significant difference 
test, reliability and validity and so on which are frequently 
considered teaching-based and neglect the elective 
relevance of the student-led curriculum . This article 
combinates of data mining technology and achievement 
management, extracte the useful information hiddenning 
in the data from Large amounts of data, dig out the correct, 
reliable and credible association rules, and carry out the 
students work ,and improve the professional level of 
student work continuously, Guiding significance of 
student work.
