I. Introduction 
With the rise of relational data mining, kinds of 
multi-relational classifier are proposed. The existing 
classifiers can be divided into two kinds: the first one is 
based on inductive logic programming (ILP), for example, 
FOIL[2],TILDE[3],IBC[4]. Such approach has achieved 
good classification accuracy, but efficiency is lower; the 
second is based on relational database technology, these 
methods have a high efficiency, but relatively low 
accuracy. In recent years, the representative of 
Multi-relational Classification Algorithm are CrossMine[5] 
algorithm and the Graph-NB[6] algorithm. CrossMine 
algorithm is mixed ILP and relational database, improved 
the accuracy of traditional ILP and FOIL. But it is still 
based on logical reasoning, the process of Predicate 
Evaluation is still complex. Graph-NB algorithm is based 
on Semantic Relational Graph(SRG) that builds a 
semantic graph before classification, uses Pruning 
strategy of “cutting off” to prun the table in order to 
improve the Classification accuracy rate. This algorithm 
can directly support the relational database, but the time 
complexity is larger and efficiency is lower. 
Chinese scholar Yang Guangmei, Yang Bingru proposed 
Multi-relational Naive Bayesian Classifier based on 
mutu- al information. It is on the basis of the tuple ID 
propagation method and counting methods towards tuple, 
can find the most relevant attributes for classification 
without increasing the time complexity. However, when 
determine the related degree between target table and 
other tables , the weights determined by experts in the 
field, it has a certain subjective. Guo Jingfeng proposed 
An New Multi-Relational Association Rule Mining 
Algorithm with User’s Guidance. The concept of user’s 
guidance is introduced. The usage of this approach 
improves user’s satisfaction of the mining result. 
However, due to its highly subjective, it is easy to make 
semantic bias that affect classification results.  
Using Rough Set, This paper propose a Multi-Relational 
Bayesian Classification Algorithm with Rough Set 
(RS-RBC). The concept of relational graph used to 
dynamic choice associative table associated with the 
target table, and a tuple ID propagation approach is used 
to solve directly the association rule mining problem with 
multiple database relations, and the concept of Core in 
Rough Set is introduced, simplify the associative table. 
Compared with the traditional algorithm,it improves the 
accuracy rate. This algorithm can directly support the 
relational database, its running rate is much higher than 
that of  Multi-Relational Classification Algorithm based 
on ILP. 
                                                                                                                                          1566
II.  Basic concepts 
A.Concepts of Rough set 
Knowledge reduction, that is, maintain the classification 
ability and delete irrelevant or unimportant knowledge.  
? is equivalence relation? ,??P if ( ) { }( )Pindind ??=? ? 
then P  is unnecessary in ? ; Otherwise, P  is 
necessary in ?  . 
If ,??P is necessary in ? ?zhen ? is independent?if 
not, then ? is dependent. 
Definition 1: Core: the set of all necessary relationships is 
called Core in ? , denoted as ( )?Core . 
B. concepts of Relational Data Mining 
Relational database is composed by many relationship 
tables and association relationship of each table. 
Definition 2: Relational graph: In a given database D, 
creat Relational graph through link between the table's 
primary and foreign key. It is a directed acyclic graph. 
Each table is as a node, each side is the connection 
between the relationship table. Arrow points to the table 
where has the primary key. 
Definition 3: Associative table: In database D, for a 
classification task T, it is called association table that 
related by classification task and associated with the 
target table. 
Definition 4: Isolation table: In database D, for a 
classification task T, It is called isolation table that has 
nothing with target table. 
As we can be seen, isolation table and target table are 
just in the same database. Moreover, isolation tables and 
relationships table, target table is relative. A table will 
become an isolated form, depending on the classification 
task. Figure 1 is a Relational graph of seven tables. 
 
Figure 1 A Relational graph 
333231222111 ,,,,, RRRRRR  compose a Relational graph. 
11R  is targer table, 3332312221 ,,,, RRRRR  is Associative table, 
56R  is Isolation table. 
To show the role of associative table, using class label 
propagation method, a given tuple in the target table 
contains class label, while the tuples in other tables are no 
class label.  
Definition 5: Class label propagation: it is supposed that 
there are two relations 1R  and 2R  where 1R  is the 
target relation, and they can be connected by the 
attributes AR .1  and AR .2  where A  is the primary key 
or foreign key. Then the class labels of the tuple in 1R  
can be transmitted to the tuples in 2R  by attribute A . 
In fact, the method of the class label propagation is a 
virtual connection in contingency table. The result from 
the physical connection to the table is a table that 
contains large amounts of data, and contains a large 
number of redundant data that the operation is extremely 
troublesome. While if it is used the method of the class 
label propagation , there is no such problems. And as so, 
we can also get the class labels of the tuples in 
cintingency table, and can easily calculate the nuclear 
properties in the table. 
Definition 6 Classification Attribute Set: From 
multi-relational table, we can select all or part of 
properties to determine which class attribute set the given 
data belongs to, known as class attributes set. 
The size and the properties of classification attribute set 
has a direct impact on the efficiency and accuracy of 
classification, so it is eaaential about how to determine 
the classification attribute set. 
III. RS-RBC Algorithm Design and Its 
Implementation 
A Calculation of the classification attribute set 
In accordance with the classification of multi-relations, 
we need to calculate attributes set and their probabilities 
in many contingency tables. It is critical to choose what 
kind of property as a classification attribute, which can 
directly impact the classification accuracy. The 
multi-relational Bayesian classification algorithm based 
on the relationship semantic diagram is to select all the 
attributes as a classification attribute set, which has a 
large calculation. While the multi-relational Bayesian 
classification algorithm based on user-guided is to select 
all the attributes in the target table and some attributes 
specified by the user. Although it has a reduction of the 
11R  
21R  
22R  
31R  
32R  
33R  
56R  
                                                                                                                                          1567
computation, the users is too subjective to response the 
true result of the data classification. 
Here we propose a method to calculate the nuclear 
attributes set of each contingency table using the rough 
set,and then find out their union as a classification 
attribute set. Concrete steps are as follows: 
(1) Calculate the nuclear properties of the target table M , 
recorded as ( )MCore ; 
(2) Do the attribute reduction to the contingency table 
after the tuple class label transmited, then find its nuclear     
property ( )iRCore ; 
(3) Synthesize classification attribute Set 
 ( )sppf aaaaA "" ,,, 11 += , where, paa ",1 are the nuclear 
properties of the target table, sp aa ",1+ are the nuclear 
properties of the contingency table. 
B. RS-RBC Algorithm 
Step 1: Analyze the primary keys and foreign keys of the 
contingency tables in database, resulting 
diagram. 
Step 2: Scan diagram, in accordance with ARAR ji .. = , 
trasmit the class label of the tuple in the target 
table M  to the contingency tables. 
Step 3: Generate classification attribute set fA ; 
Step 4: For m  classes mCCC ",, 21 , we need calculate the 
posterior probabilities under the condition x of 
classification attribute set, if and only if the type 
( ) ( )xCPxCP ji = , mji ?? and ji ?  is true, the 
algorithm will distribute the instance x  to class 
iC  . 
C Algorithm 
The symbols and functions referred to the algorithm is 
as follows: 
(1) M  is the target table, iR ),2,1( ni "= are the 
association tables, f is the classification attribute set 
system-generated, x  is the tuple to be classify; 
(2) Function ClassificationProb ( x ) is calculating of the 
posterior probability of each class; 
(3) Function Propagate ( )MRi ,  means to transmit the class 
label to the table iR  from the target table M ; 
(4) Function CreateRelationGraph (G) is generating a 
relation diagram. 
The algorithm is as follows: 
Input: target table M , contingency tables iR ),2,1( ni "= , 
tuple x  to be classified; 
Output: the class label of the tuple to be classified. 
Algorithm: 
CreateRelationGraph (G); 
Propagate ( )MRi , ; 
For each table iR  do          
iRA =Core ( iR );

D Experiment 
Comparison experiment is carried out under IBM. We 
can do the experiments separate 10 times by three 
algorithm, the Naive Bayes (NB), Graph_NB and 
RS-RBC in the database R *. T500.F2, then calculate the 
average values of the 10 running times to get the result 
shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2 the comparison figure of the running time in 
R*.T500.F2 
Figure 2 shows that the running time by the NB 
classification algorithm is far longer than by the RC-RBC 
algorithm. When the number of the tables increases, the 
running time by NB algorithm increases rapidly, while 
that by Graph_NB algorithm or the RS-RBC algorithm is 
on a relatively stable, however, the performance of the 
RS-RBC algorithm is better than that of the algorithm 
Graph_NB.

dynamically select the contingency table associated with 
the target table. We can improve efficiency and the 
accuracy in mining the massive data by a virtual 
connection to the contingency tables using the method of 
tuple class lable transmitting and by an introduction to 
the concept of the nuclear in the rough set. Experimental 
result shows that the algorithm has a significant 
improvement on the running time which is an extension 
of the traditional classification algorithm in dealing with 
the massive data. 
The further research is including how to use the rough 
set method to determine the weight of the contingency 
tables and the selected class attribute weights, and thus to 
build up multi-relationship weighted Bayesian 
classification algorithm based on rough set.
