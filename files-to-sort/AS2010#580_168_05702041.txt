Abstract— Shoppers having a predefined shopping list usually 
follow the shortest path through a supermarket or store in 
order to make their purchases. This paper aims to study 
customer behaviour of such shoppers with respect to two 
aspects: (1) the path followed through the store to make those 
purchases. (2) the average path length to make those 
purchases.  
The paper also proposes a methodology consisting of a 
number of stages such as data cleaning, path generation, 
clustering and classification, association rule generation, 
determination of attraction values that correspond to the 
appeal of each product or location and calculation of metrics 
such as average path length of paths taken by customers, 
average number of purchases per bill for trend analysis. This 
research can be used to recommend certain changes, in terms 
of the store layout, in order to increase the attraction and 
saleability of the various products in different locations in the 
store as an effect of modified store layout. 
 
Keywords- Intelligent Recommender system, shopper path 
analysis, product attraction, location attraction, purchase

I.  INTRODUCTION  
This paper aims to study customer behaviour with respect 
to the above aspects. Also, it aims to find the attractions of 
the various product categories and the associations between 
them. Based on this research, it proposes to recommend 
certain changes, in terms of the store layout, in order to 
increase the attraction and sale ability of the various products 
in different zones. 
  
Shoppers carrying a predefined shopping list usually 
follow a well thought of path through a supermarket in order 
to make their purchases [1]. They travel through the aisles, 
checking out different options/ costs of different products of 
various categories, make certain decisions about which 
products to buy till their shopping trip is complete. The 
purchases may be need based or want based. The parameters 
affecting the choices could be the cost, appeal of the product 
and the urgency of the requirement of the product. Hence, 
there may be several variations in the shopping patterns of 
different shoppers. Some may travel through the entire store 
while others may just visit a few zones. Also, different 
shoppers may follow different paths while visiting the same 
zones. 
A. Motivation:  
The paper aims at studying shopper path behaviour 
which is an exciting area of research. Although there is lot 
of work done in the area of shopper’s purchase behavior 
there has been very little work to exploit the path knowledge 
for the benefit of shop keeper. The only published paper that 
the author’s came across was by Larson et al [1]. However, 
the path data that was gathered was used to categorize the 
customers rather than finding the product /location 
attractions for a better layout of the store. 
 
In the present times, if a customer with the same shopping 
list visits two different stores, one finds that the number of 
purchases made by the customer may differ for the two shops. 
There could be several reasons for the difference in purchases 
made by the customer. One of the reasons for that could be the 
location of the zones or the layout of the store. With the 
number of shops and stores coming up at a rapid pace, it is 
important for these shop owners to utilize the data at hand for 
competitive intelligence. The analysis can be used to evaluate 
all the possible methods the shop owner can resort to for up-
selling and cross selling. The simple statistical parameters of 
Product Attraction, Location Attraction and Average path 
length can be extremely useful. This is where the location 
(placement) of the zones or the layout of the store would 
matter. Modifying the store layout using the simple 
parameters mentioned above and then recalculating the 
average path length travelled by the customer for the new 
store layout (for the same set of transactions) will help one 
to analyse the current product visibility in terms of the paths 
undertaken by the customers. This information could be 
beneficially utilized by the retailers for up-selling of 
products, proper layout of stores with possibility of cross 
selling and profit maximization. 
B. Approach: 
The paper aims to make use of a data set consisting of 
purchase invoices of several customers to generate a set of 
paths based on purchases. The set of paths along with the 
corresponding purchases made by the customers can be used 
for analyzing customer behaviour with regard to the paths 
followed by them. The purchase data is also used to study 
the associations between various product categories.

The paper aims to introduce the concept of ‘attraction’ 
which is a simple measure of the inherent appeal of a 
product category. Statistical measures such as the average 
path length of the customers and the average number of 
products purchased per visit are calculated. The association 
rules, attractions and statistical measures are used to make 
recommendations and suggest alternative store layouts. 
C. Issues: 
Customer paths may not always be representative of the 
shopping patterns of the customers because: 
 
1. There is a considerable proportion of shoppers who 
visit the store but do not purchase anything. This paper 
considers only those customers who make at least one 
purchase while visiting the store. 
2. Not all the customers entering the store may know 
the layout of the store. An assumption is made here that all 
customers know the store layout well and hence follow the 
shortest path that connects all their purchases.  
3. Although the initial objective was to recommend a 
product to the customer using the location of the customer 
in the store, since the data set did not include the time 
dimension, the time spent by each customer in the various 
zones was not captured. This led to only recommendation to 
the store owner regarding the layout of the store. 
II. CURRENT TRENDS 
A. Placement of Products  
     A visit to the shopping store will reveal that the 
store managers look to place the products in their store 
based on the following.  
1) Product categories. 
 The products belonging to the same category are placed 
in a single location. e.g. Electronics items are generally 
placed together.  
2) Brands:  
Different Brands of a similar product are clubbed 
together to provide the customer with multiple options 
available for the same product. E.g. Biscuits of 
Britannia, Parle, Sun Feast, and other Brands.  
3) Promotions. 
 Promotional offers sometimes drive the location of the 
products in the store so that products falling under the 
promotional scheme get more visibility.  
4) Intuition or Experience. 
 Most store managers rely on their intuition and experience 
to determine the placements of products in their store.  
B. Research in the Relevant Field: 
Presently, the typical customer is assumed to travel 
through the store, stopping at various locations, deliberating 
about his/her consideration set, choosing the best (utility 
maximizing) option, and then continuing in a similar 
manner until the trip is complete. Despite the common 
presumption of this scenario, little research has been 
undertaken to understand the actual travel patterns and 
purchases within the supermarket.   
The efforts made so far by store managers to study 
customer shopping patterns and reasons for failure are given 
below: 
 
Feedback forms. Though the interests in the products may 
have been captured, they do not provide an accurate picture 
as more often they tend to capture the customers shopping 
interest and are seldom representative of the customer 
shopping behaviour. Moreover, customers give little 
attention to the feedback forms they fill.   
Membership programs. The membership programs do not 
provide an accurate picture of the shopping patterns as very 
small percentage of the customers enroll for such programs.  
 
Discount Coupons. These help in capturing behaviour of 
customer with regard to promotions and offers but not the 
general shopping patterns.    
Video Cameras. Though they are rich sources of information , 
analysis of the same is often difficult.  
 
Such failed attempts triggered the need to look out for 
other ways to understand the customer shopping behaviour. 
 
III. PROCEDURE DESIGN 
After the data set consisting of purchase invoices was 
obtained many processing stages were carried out. They 
were: Initial data cleaning, Product Categorization into 
zone, re-cleaning after categorization, Path Generation using 
Dijakstra’s Algorithm, Clustering, Association Analysis and 
calculation of PRODUCT Attraction, LOCATION 
Attraction and Average path length before the 
recommendations could be made. These steps are explained 
in detail in the following sections. 
A. Initial Data Cleaning: 
The raw data set (that was stripped of confidentiality 
information if any) obtained had a large amount of details 
that were not relevant in the analysis. To make data more fit 
for processing and reducing the processing time, only the 
relevant content was extracted and stored in an output file.  
Extraction was carried out using pattern matching. [5], [6], 
[7]. The relevant content extracted from the raw set 
contained the date, time, and the list of transactions in each 
bill. 
B. Categorizing: 
The store layout was studied and the store was divided 
into various zones. A single entry and exit point was 
assumed to the store. Each of the product sold in the store 
was assigned to a particular zone. The entire analysis, for 
the first cut, was carried out at a zone level and not at a 
598
product level, since the granularity at product level was too 
fine, both for efficient processing and efficient data analysis. 
Hence the products were mapped into their categories. For 
the specific store in consideration, mapping resulted in 19 
categories. More categories can be introduced as per the 
need. After the mapping, each transaction in each bill was 
compared with the categories to find a match. Thereafter, 
the product was replaced by appropriate category number. 
Algorithm: 
1. Scan the cleaned data for each bill. 
2. In each bill, write the date and time as it is 
in the output file. 
3. For each product encountered, match the 
keywords with those in the category file. 
4. If a match is found, replace it with 
appropriate category, else place the 
product in the miscellaneous category. 
5. Continue the process till end of file is 
reached. 
 
C. Data Cleaning after Categorizing: 
Replacing the products by their respective categories 
resulted in bills having repetition of categories that was 
undesirable, so all the repeat occurrences were replaced by a 
single occurrence. Also, certain null bills (bills with no 
entries) were found. Such bills were eliminated from the 
analysis at this stage. 
D. Path Generation: 
This phase aimed at generating paths along the zones 
which customers would have taken based on the knowledge 
of the products they had purchased in a single billing 
transaction. It was assumed that the customers follow 
shortest paths and showed forward looking behaviour. The 
algorithm is described in short here: 
The store layout is the first input. This is stored in the form 
of a non-weighted graph and assumes 0 as the start zone and 
n+1 as the exit zone (where n are the no of zones). It assigns 
the zones from where products are purchased as 
intermediate zones. Let's starting node be an initial node. 
Let a distance of a node X be the distance from the initial 
node to it. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial 
distance values and will try to improve them step-by-step. 
1. Assign to every node a distance value. Set it to zero 
for our initial node and to infinity for all other 
nodes. 
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited. Set initial node as 
current. 
3. For current node, consider all its unvisited 
neighbors and calculate their distance (from the 
initial node). For example, if current node (A) has 
distance of 6, and an edge connecting it with 
another node (B) is 2, the distance to B through A 
will be 6+2=8. If this distance is less than the 
previously recorded distance (infinity in the 
beginning, zero for the initial node), overwrite the 
distance. 
4. When we are done considering all neighbors of the 
current node, mark it as visited. A visited node will 
not be checked ever again; its distance recorded 
now is final and minimal. 
5. Set the unvisited node with the smallest distance 
(from the initial node) as the next "current node" 
and continue from step 3 
The output is stored in the appropriate file and contains the 
date, time, path followed by the customer and minimum 
cost of the path. Alternatives that were considered to 
Djikstra’s shortest path algorithm were k-minimum 
spanning tree algorithm, Travelling Salesman Problem and 
Bellman Ford algorithm.  
In the theory of computational complexity, the decision 
version of TSP belongs to the class of NP-complete 
problems. Thus, it is assumed that there is no efficient 
algorithm for solving TSP problems. In other words, it is 
likely that the worst case running time for any algorithm for 
TSP increases exponentially with the number of zones, so 
even some instances with only hundreds of zones will take 
many CPU years to solve exactly. Since Dijkstra’s 
Algorithm provides a relatively faster solution, it was 
chosen over TSP. 
The Bellman–Ford algorithm, a label correcting algorithm, 
computes single-source shortest paths in a weighted digraph 
(where some of the edge weights may be negative). If a 
graph contains a cycle of total negative weight then 
arbitrarily low weights are achievable and so there's no 
solution; Bellman-Ford detects this case. 
If the graph does contain a cycle of negative weights, 
Bellman-Ford can only detect this; Bellman-Ford cannot 
find the shortest path that does not repeat any vertex in such 
a graph.  
 
The main disadvantages of the Bellman–Ford algorithm in 
this setting are 
x Does not scale well, Changes in network topology 
are not reflected quickly since updates are spread 
node-by-node, Counting to infinity(if link or node 
failures render a node unreachable from some set 
of other nodes, those nodes may spend forever 
gradually increasing their estimates of the distance 
to it, and in the meantime there may be routing 
loops) 
599
For these disadvantages and since Djikstra’s algorithm 
solves the same problem with a lower running time, but 
requires edge weights to be non-negative. Thus, Bellman–
Ford is usually used only when there are negative edge 
weights.  
A related graph is the k-minimum spanning tree (k-MST) 
which is the tree that spans some subset of k vertices in the 
graph with minimum weight. 
A set of k-smallest spanning trees is a subset of k spanning 
trees (out of all possible spanning trees) such that no 
spanning tree outside the subset has smaller weight. 
However, this was not adopted because it was more 
complex as compared to Djikstr’s algorithm.  
E. Clustering: 
Based on the purchase details in a single transaction, an 
attempt was made to capture the relation between the 
number of products bought per transaction and the number 
of zones the customer would have visited for the same. [2], 
[3]. This step was performed to analyze the number of zones 
that would be visited for a given number of products 
bought. 
 
Algorithm: 
 
1. Extract the number of categories of the products 
purchased from the clean data and   save it in  file. 
2. Extract the number of zones visited for the corresponding 
transaction and save it.  
3. Repeat the above two steps till end of files. 
4. From the new file thus generated we find out the 
frequency of each set of (No. of zones, Path length) and 
store it in a new file. 
 
F. Association: 
Association rule mining [3], [4] was used to find out the 
associations that satisfy the predefined minimum support 
and confidence of the various zones of the store from the 
database. The problem was decomposed into two sub 
problems. One was to find large item sets. The second 
problem was to generate association rules from those large 
item sets with the constraints of minimal confidence. The 
Apriori algorithm was used to find the frequent sets L in 
database D. 
x Find frequent set Lk ? 1. 
o Join Step: Ck is generated by joining Lk ? 
1with itself 
o Prune Step: Any (k ? 1) -item set that is 
not frequent, and hence does not have the 
minimum support, cannot be a subset of a 
frequent k -item set, hence should be 
removed where 
 (Ck: Candidate item set of size k) 
 (Lk: frequent item set of size k) 
G. Attraction Calculation: 
The attraction of each zone in the store was determined. 
A simple statistical measure was used to analyze which zone 
appealed to the shoppers more, based on the following two 
criteria: 
 
(i) Product Attraction   
(ii) Location Attraction 
 
1) PRODUCT ATTRACTION: 
This metric was used in order to determine the appeal of 
the various products placed in a particular zone. It is a 
ratio of the number of purchases made from a zone to the 
number of visits made to that zone, within a specified 
period of time. The formula is as follows:   
PA = ?Pi ?Vi 
  where PA  ? Product Attraction  
?Pi ? Number of purchases made from zone i. 
           ?Vi ? Number of bills in which zone i is present.  
Product Attraction is an indication of the Current Attraction 
of a particular category. 
 
2) LOCATION ATTRACTION: 
This metric was used in order to determine the appeal of the 
location of a particular zone. It was calculated as a ratio of 
the number of visits made to a zone to the number of total 
visits made to the store, within a specified period of time. 
The formula is as follows:  
LA = ?Vi ?V 
        where LA  ? Location Attraction  
?Vi ? Total number of visits made to zone i 
 ?V?Sum of number of visits made to each zone  
Location Attraction is an indication of the Potential 
Attraction of a particular zone. 
H. Average Path Length and Analysis: 
The step was aimed at determining the average path 
length of all the paths undertaken by the customers. This 
information can be used to strategically place the products 
having the potential to be sold if kept within the right reach. 
That is products in the zone with low attractions can be 
placed in the zones with high location advantage for up 
selling. 
An average number of products purchased by a 
customer were also calculated for future trend analysis. This 
can be used to statistically determine the inventory required. 
IV. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS 
The star schema for the system is shown in Fig.1. The initial 
600
store layout and the respective zones is shown in Fig.2.

The products are then categorized into specific zones where 
one had to identify and ensure that the products were correctly 
classified since there could be overlapping keywords in product 
names likes coil and oil that needed to be classified in different 
zones.  
After the initial data cleaning, the sample input and output 
were as follows:

The min cost for each path was found out as the zones 
that were visited For example, the path cost for the bill 
generated as follows: 
05/10/2005,04:23 pm,0, 5, 7, 8, 7, 5, 20, Min cost:6 
 
Based on the number of customers and the path length 
customer clusters were formed as shown in Fig. 3

V. CONCLUSION 
The paper thus presents an simple yet effective and 
innovative approach to analyze shopper's paths and 
purchases and draw suitable results which would help shop 
owners to enhance their sales. 
VI. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS 
Our analysis can be further improved by considering 
the following features. 
A. Multi - Dimensional Store Layout 
In this analysis the authors have only considered a 2-
Dimensional store layout, wherein the placement of 
products at the shelf level has not been taken into account. 
The analysis can be extended to include a third dimension 
along the height of the store by considering the various 
shelves. E.g.: Shelf height 
B. Time Variant data: 
The data set provided contained purchase invoices of a 
single month. Hence, the analysis carried to was limited to 
the data of only one month. If more data is available, a 
time variant analysis with the appropriate weightings can 
also be undertaken. 
C. Time Spent by customer in various Zones: 
Since the data provided did not contain the time dimension, 
the analysis done in this paper misses out on the time spent 
by customers on different products in various zones which 
can have an influence on the attractions of the products and 
their locations and hence, can produce more accurate results 
for more appropriate recommendations. 
D. Mulitple Entry Points to a store: 
The store layout has been constrained with a single entry 
and exit point. Variations in the same can have considerable 
effects on the results. 
E. Deviating from path Customers: 
The shortest paths assigned to the customers, by the 
approach used in this paper, are not applicable for the entire 
set of customers. This is because there may be some 
customers who deviate from the shortest path while 
traversing the store. Thus, appropriate variations in some of 
the shortest paths generated could help improve the 
outcome.
