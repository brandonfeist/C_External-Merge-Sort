Abstract—Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is always 
an important and difficult problem that requires to be 
solved in Nature Language Processing. This paper 
presents a new WSD method which is based on the 
mining association rules. The method can mine the 
association rules between the sense of the ambiguous 
word and its context, to construct an association rules - 
based database. At last the sense of the ambiguous word 
is marked by choosing the sense which the most 
association rules define. The experiment result shows that 
the method has high precision.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Word sense disambiguation is very important in 
many fields of Natural Language Processing, such as 
information retrieval, the example-based machine 
translating system, semantic analysis, syntax analysis, 
speech recognition, text-to-speech and so on[1]. As an 
important research field, many research institutes and 
colleges have devoted much energy to do related 
research. Word sense disambiguation is to define the 
sense of the ambiguous word according to its context. 
Given the word W with N senses, in the specific 
context C the word W has a confined sense 'S . The task 
of WSD is to choose the determined sense from the N 
senses. The whole process can be defined by the follow 
formula [2]:  
)|(maxarg' CSRS k=     (1) 
Some methods have already been used to 
disambiguate the ambiguous word sense. Quan 
Changqin[3] presented a method of word sense 
disambiguation based on multi-classifier decision, the 
method trained the committee classifiers by learning a 
smallest of labeled examples and then these classifiers 
were updated dynamically by unlabeled examples, the 
sense of ambiguous words were determined by 
combining the decision of the final committee 
classifiers. Yang Erhong[4] described a Chinese word 
sense disambiguation method based on primitive co-
occurrence data, which overcome the problem of data 
sparseness using the property of the HowNet[5]. Using 
the word definition in the HowNet, the primitive co-
occurrence data matrix was obtained, which were 
collected from a corpus of about 100000 characters 
without any manual tagging. 
Based on all of the previous research, this paper 
proposes a new WSD method based on the mining 
association rules, which can mine the association rules 
between the sense of the ambiguous word and its 
context, to construct an association rules - based 
database. At last the sense of the ambiguous word is 
determined by choosing the sense which the most 
association rules deduced. 
II. WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION BASED ON 
MINING ASSOCIATION RULES 
A.  Description of the Association Rules 
To mine the association rules is to discover the 
important relevance between the items in a transaction 
database. In the association rules, the item sets 
I={i1,i2,…,in} is the set which includes n different items. 
Given a transaction database D, each transaction record 
in it is a subset of the sets I. The association rule is 
described as YX? , here IX ? , IY ?  
and ??YX  . Its support degree and confidence 
degree are separately defined as follow formulas. 
{ } DTYT,XDT)YX(support ???=?
        (2) 
)X(support)YX(support)YX(confidence *=?
   (3) 
The task of mining association rules is to discover 
all of the strong association rules. The support degree of 
the rules is no less than the threshold of support degree 
and the confidence degree is no less than the threshold 
of the confidence degree.   
From formula (2), the support degree reflects the 
frequency of the relation YX? occurring in the 
transaction database D. The item set, which frequency 
is more than the threshold, is a frequent item sets. So 
we think the production of the frequent item sets is

because there is some correlation between the 
corresponding items.  
B.  Basic Idea of the WSD Algorithm Based on 
Mining Association Rules 
In the paper, the context of an ambiguous word is 
regarded as a transaction record, the words in the 
context and the senses of the ambiguous word are 
regarded as items. If some items frequently occur 
together in some transactions (the context of the 
ambiguous word), then there must be some correlation 
between the items. The paper redefines the meanings of 
the formula (2) and formula (3). Given an ambiguous 
word, Y presents the set of the senses of the word, X 
means the set of its context words. The item sets I 
includes all senses of the ambiguous word and all 
words of its context. The database D is the context 
document sets of the word, each record T is a context of 
the word. The association rule YX? means that the 
sense of the word can be determined by its context. 
The basic idea of the WSD algorithm based on 
mining association rules is: to discover the frequent 
item sets composed of the sense of the ambiguous word 
and its context by scanning its context database, which 
support degree is no less than the threshold of support 
degree; to produce the association rules YX?  which 
confidence degree is no less than the threshold of the 
confidence degree from maximum frequent item sets; at 
last to determine the sense of the ambiguous word by 
choosing the sense which the most association rules 
deduced. 
In the producing process of the frequent item sets, 
there are too many words in the item sets which leads to 
produce too many N-frequent item sets (here, N is a 
large number). According to Martin’s research [6], 5 
words in each pre and post of the core word may 
provide 95% semantic collocated information, so in this 
paper N is no more than 10. In the research, there are 
more items in the frequent item sets, theirs frequency 
occurring in the context database is less, theirs support 
degree is less. But these frequent item sets are helpful to 
the WSD. In order to avoid to loss these frequent item 
sets, the paper gives different min-support degree 
according to different N-frequent item sets. N is larger, 
the min-support degree is smaller. N is smaller, the 
degree is larger. The association rule YX? , which 
confidence degree is no less than the threshold of the 
confidence degree, is produced. 
C.  WSD Algorithm Based on Mining Association 
Rules 
Given an ambiguous word, firstly choose the 
association rules from the association rules database 
according to its context words, the selected rules may 
be more than one; they are all used in WSD. At last the 
sense of the ambiguous word is determined by the rules 
committee voting, the sense which is decided by the 
most rules is selected as the sense of the ambiguous 
word in its context. The algorithm is as follows: 
• Step1: Produce the frequent item sets. 
• Step1.1:  Generate the 1-candidate sets 
according to the context database, scan the 
database to obtain their support degree, select 
the candidate sets which support degree is no 
less than the threshold of support degree to 
formulate the 1-frenquent item sets;  
• Step1.2: Use N-frequent item sets to generate 
N+1-candidate sets, set a smaller threshold of 
support degree, rescan the database to obtain 
their support degree, select the candidate sets 
which degree is no less than the threshold to 
formulate the N+1-frenquent item sets;  
• Step1.3: Try the step1.2 again and again, until 
no N+1 candidate sets generates or N is more 
than 10. Get all frequent item sets which satisfy 
the condition.  
• Step2: Produce the association rules YX?  
from maximum frequent item sets according to 
the threshold of the confidence degree.  
• Step3: Given an ambiguous word, choose the 
association rules according to its context words. 
At last the sense of the ambiguous word is 
determined by the rules committee voting. The 
sense, which is decided by the most rules, is 
selected as the sense of the ambiguous word in 
its context.  
• Step4: Output the sense. 
• Step5: End the program. 
III. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS  
There aren’t standard data sources for Chinese 
WSD. So we download the free sentences including 
ambiguous words “??” (“material”, “information”, 
“quality”), “?”(“alter”, “amend”), “??”(“behavior”, 
“information”, “show off”, “show”), “??” (“healthy”, 
“advantageous”, “health”, “normal”)from the Center for 
Chinese Linguistics PKU to construct our test data. The 
sentence is extracted as the units of the context of the 
ambiguous words. If the length of the sentence is less 
than 5, the sentence is deleted. In the experiments, the 
senses of the ambiguous word come from 
HowNet2008. The term of precision is conducted to 
evaluate the system, the formula is as follows.

The result shows as in table 1. The results in table 2 
come from document [7].

In table 2, the senses of the ambiguous word come 
from TONGYICICILIN. Because the two methods use 
different semantic dictionary, to the same ambiguous 
word, there are different sense definition and different 
sense number. This method can not compare directly 
with Li’s method. In the whole, the precision with this 
paper method is higher than the precision with Li’s 
method.  
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
In this paper, we propose a new WSD method based 
on the mining association rules, which can mine the 
association rules between the sense of the ambiguous 
word and its context, and the sense of the ambiguous 
word is determined by choosing the sense which the 
most association rules deduced. The experimental 
results show that the precision obtained by our 
algorithm is higher than other algorithms. However, our 
algorithm still has some small drawbacks. More 
research will be done to improve our algorithm 
performance in the future, which is to improve the 
method of mining association rules.
