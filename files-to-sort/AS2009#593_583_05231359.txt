I.  INTRODUCTION 
With the development of society and science, the 
technology of telemedicine has been developing rapidly in 
recent years following the progress of computer and 
communication network. Patient can communicate with 
doctor and can be real-timely monitored at home through 
some simple medical terminals with several vital sensors 
located at home, those terminals connect with hospital 
monitoring center via internet, and data will be real-timely 
acquired and compressed, continuously transmitted to a 
hospital monitoring center [1]. Many problems are solved 
with it, such as it is expensive and inconvenient for patients 
to seeing a doctor [2], and hospital can not afford the service 
to patients in time as there are too many patients [3], etc. 
Long-term and continuous monitoring should be offered in 
order to provide exact cure to patients in time. However, 
there must be a large number of data in the server as a result 
of the long-term and continuous monitoring [4], and it is 
inconvenient for physician and specialists to diagnose 
because of those data. Thus, it is urgent to extract the 
implicit, the unknown, the potential, the deeper and the 
valuable information from those large data to support 
specialists to make decision. 
For the purpose, the technology of data mining [5] was 
applied in this article to analyze and deal with a large 
number of data, so that healthcare experts can provide more 
accurate information for patients from a newer, higher and 
more comprehensive perspective. And the home health 
telemonitoring system based on data mining was put 
forward, realizing specialist consultation of care through 
computer at home using the technology of data mining, 
which can extract the connotative and valuable information 
automatically. The system was set up in java, and 
client/server model [6] was adopted. The monitoring center 
and the terminals were connected with javasocket, and the 
server can answer many requests of client terminals and real-
timely receive monitoring data. The client terminals can deal 
with the data received from the sensors and have the 
capabilities of real-time display, print, save and review. Data 
and alarm signals were transmitted to a hospital monitoring 
center from clients via internet, simultaneously, all received 
data in the hospital are instantly displayed on the central 
monitor screen and recorded into the knowledge [7] generated 
through the data mining techniques, and responses to the 
alarm and gives the care advice to the patient. 
II. DATA MINING 
As the monitoring system faced the confusion of “marine 
data” [8], how to handle a large amount of data and use them 
effectively, namely extracting the knowledge hidden in the 
data through analyzing the relationship between the data has 
becoming the focus research for people who are undertaking 
the information technology. Data mining technologies have 
emerged under the circumstance. Data mining is the process 
of extracting the implicit, unknown previously, and valuable 
knowledge and rules from vast, incomplete, noise, 
ambiguous and the practical application of random data. 
These rules imply the specific relations between the objects 
in the database, find a number of useful information, thus it 
overcame the bottleneck of acquiring knowledge. Specialists 
and physicians can identify those valuable rules and 
knowledge hidden in amount of data through data mining. 
By analyzing the rules and knowledge, they will have a 
better understanding of their illness, and provide more 
accurate knowledge of care. There are many algorithms of 
data mining, for instance, rough set theory, artificial neural 
networks, decision trees, genetic algorithms and association 
rules, etc. 
A. Process of Data Mining 
Implicit and valuable information can be found from vast 
data using data mining techniques. First establishing 
characteristic database of monitoring by pretreating and 
extracting the monitoring data according to the monitoring 
data drew from the cases of elder people suffering from 
different diseases with different sensors and the relevant

medical explanations provided by hospital. Data mining is an 
optimizing process of the target and data. Figure 1 shows the 
process of data mining. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  The process of data mining. 
The steps of data mining are as follows:  
1) Data extracting: Extracting the relevant data according 
to the raw data character. 
2)  Data pretreatment: Data pretreatment is the process of 
operating the data further more. After disposed, the data has 
the standard format and it can be provided for the later 
mining. The main tasks of pretreatment are data cleaning and 
data options etc. The data in the database are not all correct. 
The dirty data we called are half-baked, variance, imprecise 
and repeated, and they all need to be cleaned before they are 
loaded to the data warehouse. The first step is the noise data 
should be cleaned, the next step is rules and method of 
selecting data should be decided according to the mode, thus, 
we can select the data which meet the request of the mode. 
And the format of the data will be transformed if necessary. 
3) Data mining and knowledge base: Data mining is the 
process of extracting data and forming knowledge among the 
normative target data congregate according to the specific 
model and algorithms. To achieving the knowledge mode 
which can meet the command of users’ at last, it should have 
the support of knowledge base to communicate with users 
using the gained data again and again. The gained 
knowledge through mining is to be stored in knowledge 
base. That knowledge has different abstract arrangement and 
it can be applied to analyze data and make decision at 
different decision-making phase. 
III. SYSTEM COMPONENTS 
A. System Framework 
The system has formed the monitoring network based on 
network, and it can monitor many physiological parameters, 
including pulse, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, 
temperature etc. It also has the functions of monitoring, 
curing in time, analyzing the state of illness and so on, 
meanwhile it also can execute the consultation on line 
between patient and doctor. Figure 2 shows the total 
structure of the telemonitoring system.  
This system is mainly composed of two separate parts, a 
healthcare server and the client terminals. The main tasks of 
the client terminals are collecting the data of the pulse, 
temperature etc, and then amplifying them, A/D 
transforming, compressing and packing them and so on. 
While the server’s main tasks are analyzing the data and 
managing them. The server which is at the monitoring center 
of a hospital or specialists’ area of home healthcare can real-
timely receive and display the characteristic information 
coming from the terminals, and it will also analyze the 
signals and return the result to patient. The client that is at 
the terminal will take charge of measuring the data of users, 
collecting, and dealing with the data for the first time, and it 
can communicate with the server via internet, it was made of 
portable computer and a care bed [8] which can collect all 
kinds of physiological parameters. 
The principle of the system is as follows: collecting 
information of patients through the function modules of 
blood pressure, pulse, temperature etc. The received data will 
be disposed by the monitoring equipments and displayed at 
terminal and also transmitted to the server via internet. After 
receiving the data, the server will real-timely display the data 
and store them in the database, then the mining system will 
clean, transform and eliminate the “noise data” and 
constitute data warehouse through the data mining 
technologies, at the same time, it will produce rules and 
knowledge and establish knowledge base by distilling the 
useful information. Thus doctor will answer the alarm 
signals and feed back the doctor’s advice to the patient by 
obtaining the connotative and valuable knowledge from the 
knowledge base.

B. the Detail Module of the System 
The server will real-timely analyze and display the ECG, 
temperature and pulse waveform after receiving the data 
from the client terminals. Specialists may analyze the state of 
an illness according to the real-time waveform and data 
displayed, the system also has the functions of saving and

printing. The server not only can receive information coming 
from the terminal devices, but also can send the diagnostic 
results to the client terminals. The software of monitoring 
center has been divided into five subsystems, and Figure 3 
shows the functions in detail. 
IV. SYSTEM IMPLEMENT AND ITS KEY TECHNOLOGIES 
A. System Implement 
The system is programmed based on Windows 2003 
using java language, and its database is SQL Server 2000. It 
has many good characteristics including friendly interface, 
expansible and security etc. The system homepage is divided 
into four parts, each part displays different monitoring 
object, and each part will be zoomed out when you want to 
see the sub-interface more detail. 
B. the Transfer of Monitoring Data 
The transmitting of the monitoring data is crucial to 
whole of the remote monitoring system. At the terminal, 
intelligent monitoring terminals monitor patient and send the 
physiological parameters to the corresponding modules to 
make them converted to digital signals, and then save them 
through serial interface, and waveform will be given after 
dealing with received data such as pulse, blood pressure and 
temperature, and meanwhile the data will be sent to the 
monitoring center, which is the core of the whole system, 
and its main functions are receiving, disposing and saving 
physiological parameters coming from home users, 
displaying the physiological parameters of user who is real-
timely connected with the server, helping doctor make 
decision. And the server has also the functions of analyzing 
the illness automatically, accounting the illness and storing 
the classified data. 
In the system, Client and Server are connected with 
Socket, and data are exchanged through TCP/IP, the 
communication program at the server is implemented based 
on Socket under Java2 platform. There sets one monitoring 
port at the server and transfers the method of listening, and 
the method of accepting will be adopted when client 
terminals want to connect with the server. The server is at the 
state of waiting when the computer is starting, and 
responding to the client terminals at any time. When the 
system is running, the server starts first, and monitors the 
appointed port. The server agrees and founds connecting 
when home terminal puts forward the request of connecting. 
After finishing it, the server and the client terminals will 
communicate with each other freely. 
C. Implement of Answering Alarm with Data Mining 
In fact, the process of answering alarm is the process of 
applying iatrical knowledge. The main algorithm used in the 
system is associated rules, it is an applied technique of data 
mining, it will find useful associated knowledge from a large 
number of data including pulse, blood pressure and 
temperature, and thus the cause of disease of patient will be 
given by using the acquired knowledge. An association rules 
can be translated into two parameters: supporting(s %) and 
credibility (c %). Here we will take the hypertension for 
example, to analyze the potential therapy for patient. Table 
? shows the solutions of the hypertension. 
TABLE I.  SOLUTIONS OF HYPERTENSION 
Number Solutions of Curing Hypertension 
1 Take medicine on time, Improve on food,  
Change habitation, Enough sleeping  
2 Change habitation, Appropriate sports 
3 Take medicine on time, Improve on food, 
Appropriate sports 
4 Improve on food, Appropriate sports 
5 Take medicine on time, Improve on food, Enough sleeping 
The algorithm of association rules are used on the data in 
the table, the detail is as follows: first working out L1 
(namely gather of frequent 1 item), the results of L1 are take 
medicine on time, improve on food, change habitation, 
enough sleeping and appropriate sports. The next step is 
working out L2 (namely gather of frequent 2 items), the 
results of L2 are{(take medicine on time, improve on food), 
(take medicine on time, enough sleeping), (improve on food, 
appropriate sports), (improve on food, enough sleeping)}. 
The following step is working out L3 (namely gather of 
frequent 3 items), the result is L3 = ?, the algorithm stops 
here. Thus supporting(s %) will be given. The supporting(s 
%) of L1 are as follows: (take medicine on time, 60%), 
(improve on food, 80%), (Change habitation, 40%), (enough 
sleeping, 40%), (appropriate sports, 60%). The L2’s are: 
(take medicine on time, improve on food, 60%), (take 
medicine on time, enough sleeping, 40%), (improve on food, 
appropriate sports, 40%), (improve on food, enough 
sleeping, 40%). According to these, we will get a lot 
connotative knowledge as follows: 
• Appropriate sports? > improve on food s=40%, 
c=40/ 60=66.67%. 
• Take medicine on time?> improve on food s=60%, 
c=60/ 60=100%. 
• Improve on food?> take medicine on time s=60%, 
c=60/ 80=75%. 
Taking the first rule for example, it shows that 66.67 
percent of the patients who take part in appropriate sports 
may pay attention to improving on food. Other rules can also 
show other different results. Medical experts and doctors can 
answer the alarm signals exactly according to these rules or 
knowledge. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
Home health telemonitoring system based on data mining 
has been put forward in the paper, and the whole structure 
and functions of the system have also been given. Later some 
key technologies are presented. The system can real-timely 
connect with many client terminals and monitor patients for 
a long term. With it, many problems hardly to analyze and 
predict are resolved, and reliable data has been offered. Thus 
it will facilitate specialists to make exact judgment. The next 
step is to optimize the algorithms and make the system more 
perfect.
