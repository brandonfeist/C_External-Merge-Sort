Abstract: Estimating geographic information Image is a computerized representation of a picture or
from an image is an excellent, difficult high-level graphic. An Image Map is therefore defined to be an
computer vision problem whose time has come. image of a geographic space taken from a satellite [2].
The emergence of vast amounts of geographically So there is a need to develop a system for capturing,
calibrated image data is a great reason for storing, checking, integrating, manipulating, analysing

scale of the entire planet. In this paper, we propose the Earth.
