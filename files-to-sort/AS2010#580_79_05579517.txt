I. INTRODUCTION 
After 20 years of rapid economic development, China's 
car market has entered a phase characterized by civilian con­
sumption, a car economic model which treat the car service 
and road transport activities as center has walked into a ma­
ture track, step by step, and become an important component 
of economic development. 
In this crowded traffic situation, it is urgently required to 
develop a net-work and information-oriented vehicle and 
road traffic information management system, besides plan­
ning capital urban structure rationally, in order to improve 
public services management platform and to provide quick, 
reliable messaging services. 
For the Network bottlenecks and latency time issues 
which existed during the data transmission process in the city 
driving service system, this paper introduces a new data min­
ing algorithm which optimizes the scheduling model and 
improves the system data transmission capabilities, based on 
historical experience. 
The experiment data in this paper results from historical 
traffic records in Shanghai World Expo. 
U. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ASSOCIATION RULES IN DATA 
MINING 
A. Multi-dimensional association rules 
Currently, one-dimensional association rule mining algo­
rithm is mainly used in mining Boolean property database, 
which is not suitable to data transfer problem in the urban 
driving service system. Therefore, this paper proposes multi­
dimensional association rules mining algorithm on traffic 
flow.

Multi-dimensional association rule mmmg algorithm 
transforms the data into the n-dimensional feedback system 
expressed by n-element. These vehicle data comes from 
every data base and is sent to main base station. Through 
integrating these data, get an edited multi-dimensional data­
base system which takes the perspective of the vehicle­
oriented. 
B. Vehicle orientation prediction rules 
Firstly, data analysis is needed from each vehicle record. 
Table I is formulated from a single transmission of the base 
station.

Next, select the vehicle-oriented module based on time, 
space, vehicles. Furthermore, release the priority scheduling 
scheme based on this three-dimensional structure, which 
called vehicle orientation prediction algorithm, characterized 
for vehicle's time and spatial data. 
III. VEHICLE ORIENTATION PREDICTION ALGORITHM 
Vehicle orientation prediction algorithm is as shown in 
Fig. 1. 
Input: passing vehicle history records to database 0, col­
lection of all attributes set to X, minimum support set to min 
sup, minimum confidence set to min conf, collection of user 
concerned attributes set to P,P ? X. 
Output: multi-dimensional frequent items between P. 
Variable Description: Indiv(P) is the equivalence relation 
constructed by P. Thus, after getting equivalence relation on 
P attributes by calculation, 0 can be divided into several 
equivalence classes, this division is described by D/Indiv(P). 
Di describes the i-th subset in D/Indiv(P) equivalence class, 
{P: P(Di)} expresses P attribute values of any object in Di. 
Step 1: take vehicle records into the form of Boolean in­
formation system, initialize L into null set. 
Step2: calculate equivalence class D/Indiv(P) on P 
attribute value of D. 
For each sub-class of Di in D/Indiv (P), calculate Card 
(Di). If Card (Di) :::: min sup, then set Card (Di) into set K, K 
= K U { P:P(Di)}.

Step3: for each item sets in the set K, generate all non­
empty subset of set K, then compute confidence's value of 
s=> (k-s); if confidence ? min conf, take P into multi­
dimensional frequent item sets. 
IV. PREDICTION ALGORITHM PROCESSES 
The part of the Passing Vehicle Record from the Expo 
database is explained in Table II. 
In order to obtain priority rules on the deployment of 
network transmission, take date, time, base station, three­
dimensional into consideration, and then set min sup=0.3, 
min conf=75%, From table II, get that: X={XI, X2, X3, 
X4, X5, X6, X7}. 
Make P= {X2, X5, X7}, means the relationship be­
tween the base station and traffic flow.

When the precision of time is accurate to minute, to the 
rules of the association mining, it is difficult to find equiva­
lent classes and get the frequent item sets. Firstly, take a pre­
treatment process for time ,divide one day as forenoon 6:00 ? 
9:59, noon 1O:00?13:59, afternoon 14:00?17:59, nightfall 
l8:00?2l:59, midnight 22:00?5:59 for time division. 
Second, because of the data distribution, it is difficult to 
find strong association rules in the most detail level data. 
Thus, a concept is presented that means Regional division of 
the Expo to solve this discrete problem. 
According to the World Expo exhibition, theme building, 
piping, etc, which have been shaping the regional settings, 
the whole Expo area is divided into A, B, C, D and E five 
areas. Among them, the pipe (network connection) distribu­
tion is also in accordance with the five areas of construction 
design. So through their region, determine their membership 
of a particular area. Thus, needn't care about any particular 
moment, dozens of base stations in the busy state and just 
predict the flow of vehicles in a regional section. The results 
which are converted twice are shown in Table III. 
Set the support of the frequent item sets as 3, after poly­
merization, recalculate the equivalence classes of P. At this 
point, Dlindiv(X2X5X7(Il =1» obtains two equivalence 
classes, one contains four data elements {xl, x2, x5, x7}, and 
the other only has a single data element {x8}; also, can ob­
tain D/lndiv(X2X5X7(I2=1» as {x3}, DI In­
div(X2X5X7(I3=I» is {x4}, D/Indiv(X2X5X7(I4=1» as 
{x6}, DI Indiv(X2X5X7(I5=1»is null. It can clearly be seen 
that the I {xl,x2,x5,x7} I =4 In DI In­
div(X2X5X7(II=I»={ {xl, x2,x5,x7},{x8}} satisfy the min­
imum support. Thus, only this rule { Monday, D District, 
forenoon } meets the conditions of three-dimensional fre­
quent item sets. And this means that the cars which go 
through D section areas are more frequently. 
Thus, get following rules: 
I) Monday, D District -> am 80%; 
2) Monday morning -> D District 80%; 
3) D area in the morning -> Monday, 100%; 
4) Monday -> the morning, D District 50%. 
By the min conf = 75%, get three strong rules. Among 
this, the issues we concerned that the relationship between 
time and base station are related to the information in the 
above rules: vehicle driving record in Monday morning, 
80% came from D region segment. Thus, these rules are we 
need that its ability to dig out the three-dimensional relation­
ship among date, time and base station. 
By example analysis and processing, multi-dimensional 
frequent items algorithm which is applied for the Expo ve­
hicle platform can tum multi-dimensional association rule 
mining into equivalence classes seeking for multiple 
attributes and tum user's different requirements into the 
combination of these attributes. And the multi-dimensional 
frequent items produced by this algorithm only contains user 
concerned dimension, thus, it can be more productive to 
meet the users concerned. 
The instance mainly explains data mining process and al­
gorithms. The aim of the data mining is to realize traffic flow 
in all regions.

Thus, do not need to require the mlllimum confidence 
and only dig out the frequent sequence of A, B, C, D, E- this 
five propagation section. Then give the moment a transmis­
sion priority from high to low. 
The example describes this three-dimensional relation­
ship among date, time and base station by use algorithm. 
Then, these algorithms can also be used to calculate the flow 
of vehicle condition. At this point, we take that: 
X= {Xl, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7} , P= {X2, 
X5, X6, X7}. 
For this four-dimensional relationship, still calculate by 
use mining multi-dimensional above. Thus, can obtain rules 
like this from table III 
Monday, D District, am -> D area (flow) 75%. 
That means that 75% of the vehicles which go into D 
area also leave from D area on Monday morning, while the 
rest vehicles flow into the E area except for other areas. Thus, 
scheduling algorithms can be improved again and make fre­
quency range of each areas more precisely. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Because the scheduling module of the transmission sys­
tem runs in the background, experimental data can't be ob­
served in this design of system architecture. In order to ob­
tain experimental data, two blocks of data are embodied in 
the window platform. 
Before applying these rules above, first add a priority 
scheduling algorithm which considers the value of the task, 
the latest transmission frequency and average transfer time. 
In the application of the rules above before the addition 
of a comprehensive consideration of task value, the latest 
transmission frequency and average transfer time of the task 
priority scheduling algorithm, task scheduling to improve the 
overall performance to improve the overall performance of 
scheduling. 
In the actual interface, the real-time parameters recorded 
in the server-side are shown in Table IV, before using asso­
ciation rules. 
By 22ms transmission, observe the priority changes again 
which has shown in Table V.
