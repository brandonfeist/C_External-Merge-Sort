Abstract- There are some shortages in usual methods 
for land evaluation that too many manual interferences 
into the calculating procession. A hypergraph clustering 
model is designed with the knowledge discovery method in this 
paper based on fuzzy frequent item sets to conduct the evaluation 
for quality of farmland. It executes the mining association rules 
to the fuzzy item sets given by the definition of evaluation factors, 
and analyzes the clusters with the HMETIS segmentation 
method, finally devises the transactions similarity function to 
cluster the services. In the result, this method could not only 
determine the quality rating of each units of farmland, but also 
give the quality description for each grade. With the following 
example in Guangdong Province, China, the result is testified.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Knowledge discovery in database (KDD) is defined as a 
way which turns the effective, novel, potentially useful 
information into knowledge. KDD can be generalized as 3 
processes, data preparation, data mining and expression of 
results. Data preparation includes data input, data 
preprocessing and the definitions of data; data mining is 
defined as a method which analyse information in the 
database by constructing mathematical models. It often 
consists of data classification, data clustering, data description 
and so on. And expression of results is testing and evaluating 
the discoveries and conclusions which come out of KDD in 
real life. 
With applying the KDD method, in this paper we design a 
method which composes 2 steps, establishing the hypergraph 
model and clustering data based on hypergraph. Firstly, the 
transaction database is constructed from the evaluation units 
database. During this process, we set index description of 
evaluation factor as an data item, and express it as a vertex in 
hypergraph. The correlated items would be connected by 
weighted hyperedges. A hyperedge represents a relationship 
in the subset of evaluation units data. The weight of 
hyperedge shows the intensity of the relationship. Then 
applying the hypergraph partitioning algorithm to cluster the 
vertexes, and we will get the corresponding index for 
evaluation factors-clusters of items. Finally, these items from 
the cluster is used to describe the cluster which the transaction 
belongs.(Fig. l)

II. THE CONSTRUCTION OF HYPERGRAPH 
CLUSTERING MODEL 
A. Related definitions 
Definitionl: The number of transactions which involved 
itemset X in transaction database D is defined as support 
number, denoted as AX. The supporting degree of item set X is 
denoted as Support(x): 
Support(x) = AxilDI xlOO% (or Support(x) = AxilDI ) 
Among which IDI is the transaction number of database D, 
if Support(x) is not less than minimum supporting 
degree(Minsupport) which set by the user, then X is called as 
a frequent item set, other X is a non-frequent itemset.

Definition 2: if X and Y are itemsets, and XnY=q>, the 
formula X = > Y is called association rules. X and Y are the 
premise and conclusion of the association rules. The 
supporting degree of association rules X = > Y is the same as 
the itemset X U Y, which denoted as: 
Support(X = > Y) = Support(X U Y) 
The credibility of association rules X = > Y is denoted as: 
Confidence(X = > Y) = Support(X = > Y)/Support(X) xl 00%

The attribute value of farmland units might be continuous 
or discrete. We need to apply the fuzzy sets theory to create 
the membership function for each attribute, and change 
attribute data to the dimensionless items which show the 
monotonically increasing tendency. The continuous property 
membership data is divided into several intervals. Each 
interval composes a subset of the certain property which 
called a fuzzy itemset. If the supporting degree of the fuzzy 
item set is higher than the setting threshold, this item set is 
called a fuzzy frequent itemset. Mining the association rules 
according to the fuzzy frequent item sets would be agreeable 
to show the fuzzy phenomena in the land quality of evaluation 
units. 
B. Constructing the model 
It is assumed that there are m evaluation units of farmland 
in a certain region. n evaluation factors, the index data with 
multi-resource of evaluation unit i is defined as Xj ( j=l ... n) ; 
(XiI' Xi2' . . . • Xin). A membership function of each evaluation 
factors is established in the discussed area, which subjects to 
Yj=llj (X) (j=l ... n). And the value of membership from each 
index of factors for a evaluation unit is derived. Getting Yij =Ilj 
(xij) • Yi= (YiP Yi2' . . . • Yin) is regarded as the fuzzy feature 
vector of evaluation unit Xi. The transaction database is 
composed by the fuzzy feature vectors. 
For a weighted hypergraph H= (V. E) (Fig.2), vertex set V 
is constituted of fuzzy itemsets, and hyperedge E is composed 
of fuzzy frequent item sets. A hyperedge is expressed by a 
fuzzy frequent itemset, and the weight of each hyperedge is 
defined as the average value of all the main association rules' 
credibilities of the hyperedge. The main association rule is a 
formula which includes all the items of hyper edge and there is 
only one item on the right side. The way to get the main 
association rules will be introduced behind.

Ill. ASSOCIA TlON RULES AND THE MINING 
ALGORITHM 
A. Mining algorithm of Association rule 
Mining association rules is aimed at obtaining all the 
association rules which satisty the minimum supporting 
365 
degree-Minsupport and the mInImum credibility­
Minconfidence. Firstly all the frequent item sets in dataset D 
can be quickly searched according to the minimum supporting 
degree, then the association rules will be get from the frequent 
item sets and the minimum credibility. 
B. Generation of association rules 
After mining all the frequent item sets in the dataset, the 
strong association rules which satisty the minimum 
supporting and credibility can be produced. The specific 
operating introductions is followed: for each frequent itemset 
1 to generate all the non-empty subsets of 1, if 
sup por count (I) . 
if ---''---'---=----'--.:... ;::: mm con 
sup por _ count (s) -
We get an association rule s =>(1 - s) • among which sup 
por _ count(1) is the number of transaction records which 
contained itemset 1; sup port _ count(s) is the number of 
transaction records which contained item set S; min_ conf is 
the threshold of minimum credibility. The association rules 
are directly produced by the frequent itemsets, therefore all 
the item sets that involve in the rules will satisty the threshold 
of minimum supporting degree. 
IV. TOP-DOWN HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING 
ALGORITHM BASED ON HYPERGRAPH 
Hypergraph partitioning algorithm HMETlS is applied in 
the cluster analysis which belongs to divisive hierarchical 
clustering methods. HMETlS is a efficient layered hypergraph 
partitioning algorithm. It divides the vertices of hypergraph 
into k parts which are roughly the same and makes the least 
number of hyper edges which connect different parts. 
A Item clustering-the classification offuzzy frequent items for 
evaluation factors 
To purity the division results, we need to eliminate 
meaningless classes at first. Higher quality value of class 
implies that the inside edge of division has a greater weight. If 
the quality value of class is higher than the setting division 
threshold, the clusters are considered to be fine. 
It is assumed that e represents a vertex set of hyperedge. 
The standard for measuring whether division c is good or bad 
is defmed as follows: 
Quality(c) = Lec;;cWeight(e)ILlencl>oWeight(e) 
After obtaining the good division, we need to check the 
vertices in the division and filter those vertices which are not 
strong correlated with others. The vertex with high correlation 
value shows it has many edges which connect with other 
vertices .If the correlation value of a vertex is higher than the 
given threshold, the vertex would be considered that it 
belongs to the division, or the vertices would be eliminated 
from the division. The correlation function of vertex v is 
defined as follows: 
Re levancy(v, c) =I{e I e ? c,vEe} I I I{e I e EC} I 
After puritying the division by the 2 standards above, we 
can get high quality division of the vertices, in other words, 
the clusters that fuzzy items belong. 
B. Transactions cluster-evaluation units classification 
The hypergraph clustering model constructed in this paper 
is clustering the transactions of evaluation units by clustering 
the items of evaluation factors. That is to say, the description 
of the transactions clusters can also belong with the data items 
of factors in the classification. And we can decide which the 
cluster that evaluation units belong to through computing the 
similarity between transactions and clusters.

V. FARMLAND QUALITY EV ALUA nON OF HESHAN 
CITY 
According to the natural and economIC attributes of 
farmland in Heshan City, we make comprehensive 
assessments for the farmland quality and divide the results 
into several grades. In this case, 10 factors are chosen to be 
analyzed (Table I). The land polygons act as the evaluation 
units which come from the land use database with the scale of 
1: 1 0000. There are 7149 evaluation units in the database.

A. Creating the hypergraph clustering model for farmland 
quality evaluation 
1) Constructing transaction database 
The farmland evaluation units are taken as the transactions 
in the cluster analysis. Firstly, the membership functions of 
each evaluation factor are established. Then, the factor index 
values of all the evaluation units are substituted into the 
membership functions of each factor. Therefore the 
membership value can be obtained according to the index 
value, the transaction database is successfully established. 
2) Miningfuzzy frequent itemsets 
366 
K-means algorithm is applied in the cluster analysis for the 
membership value of evaluation factors for the threshold-type 
farmland transactions. The clusters' interval range is 
determined by the distribution of data. Fuzzy data itemsets of 
continuous evaluation factors are established which the 
number of the items is the number of clusters. For those 
discrete evaluation factor, the fuzzy items are divided 
according their index value. (Table II)

All the evaluatIOn factors are dIVIded mto 48 fuzzy Items. 
Because of membership uniqueness of each index for 
farmland units, the maximum possible total number of fuzzy 
itemsets in the transaction database would be: 
C16* C14* cIS* C14* C14* C16* C14* cIS* C17*C13 = 4838400 
Assumed that the minimum supporting degree 
minsup=O.Ol. There are 15552 frequent item sets mined by the 
Apriori algorithm. The credibility of main association rules 
can be computed. 
3) Constructing the hypergraph clustering model for farmland 
quality evaluation based on fuzzy itemsets 
Constructing a weighted hypergraph H= (V, E) , vertex set 
V is composed of 48 fuzzy item sets from aIJ evaluation 
factors, hyperedge E is the fuzzy frequent itemset, and the 
total number of the hyperedges is 15552. The weight for each 
hyperedge equals to the average value of all the main 
association rules' credibility. 
Setting the evaluation results number 4 as the given cluster 
number, that is to say, existing a segmentation N which can 
evenly divide the hypergraph H into 4 relatively independent 
subdivisions Hi' H2• H3• H4 approximately, means that there 
are 4 data cluster classes. We establish evaluation function 
f= 
• 
among wh? T#; s is the weight of hyperedge 
( es E E ) linking vertices between different subdivisions. 
Then a segmentation is searched which obtaining the 
minimum can be function value, so that making the sum of 
correlation value between each subdivision to the least. 
B. Cluster analysis based on fuzzy frequent itemsets 
1) Item clustering 
Purifying the division with the HMETIS algorithm. and the 
standards is designed for quality and correlation function. 
Then we can get the clustering results for the fuzzy items of 
farmland quality evaluation factors. (TableIII)

Summanzmg the descnptlons for mdex range of each 
cluster's data items, we could tell the characters of each 
cluster and determine the corresponding quality rating of the 
cluster. 
2) Transaction clustering 
The weighted similarity computing formula is applied in 
this part, which use the similarity between transactions to 
determine the cluster that evaluation unit belongs, among 
which the weight value is the impact weight of each 
evaluation factor (TABLE IV) . At last, substituting the property 
membership value of each farmland unit into the formula, we 
can get the quality level of each unit. (T ABLE V)

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
The substance of target item clustering is that it definites 
the range or value for the factors of a certain type or level 
farmland. This kind of evaluation ideas is more in line with 
the characters of farmland use type. 
Establishing the corresponding relationship for the index 
range and clustering results from a certain group or some 
groups of correlated evaluation factors, we can fully reflect 
the leading role of the main evaluation factors act in 
determining the unit's level. At the same time, each cluster 
(level) would have an explicit description which is very 
meaningful in the farmland quality evaluation and land 
suitability evaluation.
