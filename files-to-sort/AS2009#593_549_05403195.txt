Abstract: Effective evaluation to the significance of the items is an 
important basis to process inventory management?In this context 
we not only consider item’s own attribute such as item’s profit and 
item’s cost, but also the effect of item association to process 
inventory classification. Using association rules related theories 
we build a new evaluation criterion based weighted dollar-usage 
and propose a new model for inventory classification based 
weighted association rule. We apply an improved item 
set-enumeration expanded tree to search every candidate frequent 
itemset based on matrix structure of dataset, which not only 
realize the significance sort of  inter-itemset but also improve the 
search efficiency?Then a calculation example is presented to test 
the feasibility of the model?

I. INTRODUCTION
In general, there are more than one species, usually as 
many as hundreds of varieties, need to be managed in an 
inventory system. If each kind of goods is fine managed, 
there will be not only a very large workload, but also a high 
management costs. Obviously it is not economic. In fact, the 
contribution of every goods on the system is different, so 
managers could sort these goods based on the size of 
contribution and use different ways to manage. 
At present, ABC classification is commonly used by 
many enterprises for inventory classification. The key point 
of using ABC method lies in how to determine "important 
minorities and secondary majorities", which is the basis for 
the adoption of qualitative and quantitative analysis to sort 
the inventory management object. In accordance with the 
classification index, all the objects are divided into A, B, C 
three types, and then take the corresponding control 
strategies. The commonly used classification index of ABC 
method is the product cost [1]. Of course, this classification 
index is not the sole criterion for the importance of products. 
In addition, there are other criteria, such as product’s profit, 
availability, lead time, out-of-stock cost and rate of 
end-of-life [2]. There are also some documents think that the 
inventory classification management can not rely on only 
one index, while a variety of factors should be considered 
integrated[3] [4]. However, these methods only consider the 
product's own characteristics. In fact, the contribution of the 
product depends not only on the evaluation of the product 
itself, but also on the association impact between products. 
In this article, in order to carry out more effective 
management, we take into account the product cost and 
profit of product’s own characteristics and the associated 
impact between the items to weight the size of contribution 
of each product to the inventory classification. Combing the 
profit, cost and the relationship between items, we propose 
an inventory classification model based on the weighted 
association rules. In the process of modeling, we give 
different weights for each item according to its profit, and 
then use weighted dollar-usage of itemset to sort the 
inventory, which provides a viable new method for scientific 
and objective inventory management. 
II. INVENTORY CLASSIFICATION CRITERION BASED ON 
WEIGHTED ASSOCIATION RULE
The usual method for inventory classification only 
consider their own dollar-usage or profit of products, while 
different perspective which decision maker concerned about 
will have different criteria on the importance of inventory 
items. obviously one index is not enough to management 
needs, so in this article we use profit and dollar-usage at the 
same time for classification. However, in addition to these 
own characteristics of products, the interrelated relationship 
between items will also affect the actual sales of product. 
The sales of certain products may promote or inhibit the sale 
of other products, so some out-of-stock products may lead to 
greater related losses. The purpose of this paper is to identify 
these potential associations, while considering the product’s 
own characteristics to support inventory management 
decision making.  
The main objective of association rule mining is to find 
the association relationship between items in the transaction 
database. If two or more data items’ values happen 
repeatedly and the repeated probability is high, then there is 
a link between them and you can set up the association rules 
between them. 
A. Association rule problem description 
The problem of mining association rules can be 
formally described as follows:  
Let ^ `miiiI ,,, 21   be a set of products called items. 
Let  be a database of transactions, which is related to 
customer’s purchase behavior, where each transation 
D
t
contains a set of items such that . Every transaction is 
associated with an identifier, called . An itemset is a set 
of items and a -itemset is an itemset that contains exactly 
 items. For a given itemset  and a given transaction

Rules satisfy both a minimum s  threshold and a 
minimum  threshold are called strong rules [5]?If the 
support degree of an itemset is greater than a minimum 
threshold, the itemset satisfy the mimimum threshold. Then 
the itemset is called frequent itemset. All the frequent 
-itemset is denoted as .

Traditional association rules algorithm treats the 
various items in the database in an equal and consistent 
manner. That is, it assumes the importance of every item is 
uniform. But in practice inventory management it is not the 
case. the importance of every item to inventory management 
is different. In order to solve this problem, we give different 
weights to different item and itemset according to the 
relative profit of them. Then we use the weighted association 
rule mining algorithm to mine association items, and define 
a "weighted dollar-usage" evaluation index to evaluate the 
importance of inventory items.

Every row vector stands for an item, and every column

While our method must re-sort item continuously 
according to item weighted dollar-usage, matrix structure is 
adopted to facilitate database scanning without the need to 
consider the problems brought by the order of the item in 
transaction. The specific process can be seen in section 3.

III. INVENTORY CLASSIFICATION BASED ON WEIGHTED 
ASSOCIATION RULE
Our algorithms use breadth-first search of the set 
enumeration tree with bottom-up generate-intial-item 
seeding the search (e.g.figure1). The itemset representing an 
entire level of the tree are processed together in one pass 
over the database. Then we can calculate the weighted 
support of each node using inference-1 and weighted 
dollar-usage using definition-5. In order to realize the 
inter-itemset sort, we need to sort the frequent itemset in the 
same level which have been generated from the same root 
node in descending order by the weighted dollar-usage. Each 
node of the tree consists of four parts, i.e. <ID,items,wsp,P>. 
ID is the node identifier. items is itemset represented by the 
node. wsp is weighted support of the node. P is weighted 
dollar-usage of the node. 
Inventory classification algorithm 
Input: Minimum weighted support minwsp, profit of 
each item , cost of each item .)( jiprofit )(cos jit
Output: Sorted items 
First step: Scanning the database and computing weight 
of each item and transaction by definition-1 and definition-3 
separately. For example, the weight of item  and 
transaction  in table-1 can be formulated as: 
A
1t

2/15

=0.375 
2
)()()( 1
CwBwtw  =0.24
Second step: Scanning the database, creating the matrix 
structure of database and initializing the matrix according to 
the definition-6.  For a instance, In table-1, B  is one of 
the items in , that is 1t 1tB? , so . While 121  a 1tA? , then 
011  a .Therefore,  each element of the matrix is either 1 or 
0.
 Third step: Building a set-enumeration tree like 
figure-1. We will calculate the weighted support of each 
1-item by inference-1 after building the first level of the tree. 
Then frequent 1-item is generated from the 1-item, and 
infrequent 1-item is deleted. For example, weighted support 
of item  in table-2 can be formulated as:  A

Fourth step: Calculating the weighted dollar-usage of 
each weighted frequent 1-item by definition-5, and 
re-sorting the 1-item with the same root node in descending 
order. Such as, the weighted dollar-usage of item A  can be 
formulated as: 
)(cos*)()( AtAwspAP  =0.282*15=4.237 
Fifth step: Generating candidate k -itemset  with 
Apriori algorithm. But in the joint step of Apriori, we have 
to join itemset with the same order just in the tree. Then we 
should calculate the weighted support of each -itemset, 
and generate weighted frequent -itemset .

Sixth step: calculating weighted dollar-usage of each 
weighted frequent -itemset by definition-5, and re-sorting 
the -itemset with the same root node in descending order. 
Repeat steps5 and 6, until the weighted frequent 
-itemset

k ? kL .
Seventh step: we will use the mixed sort method [7] to 
sort all the frequent itemsets by weighted dollar-usage. Then 
we need to replace all the frequent itemsets with their 
members and hold the same rank of ordering. As a result, the 
list will be formed by single item.  Then we have to remove 
all repeated items by the scan of the list from head to tail in 
order to form a sort for each item. 
Last step: Set the division ratio of the product for 
inventory classification according to the actual situation.

IV. CALCULATION EXAMPLE 
Here, transaction dataset in table-1 is used to illustrate 
the process and prove the validation of the algorithm for 
inventory classification.  
 Let },,,,{ EDCBAI  ? ,15)(cos  At 12)(cos  Bt ,
7)(cos  Ct , ,4 cos)(cos Dt  2)(  Et  and 
}6,5,4,3,2,1{ D  showed in table-1. Let profit of each item 
1201601
equal to half of its cost for simplicity. In tradition method, 
the dollar-usage of every itemis ,30)(  AP 48)(  BP ,
,  and  which only takes 
cost into account, so the sort of inventory item is 
.

}
4)  (EP
E
In our algorithm, first let minimum weighted support 
minwsp=0.2.
 According to the above step1 of our algorithm, we get 
the weight of each transaction showed in the third column of 
table-1.  
Table 1 Data transactions 
TID Items w(t) 
1 B C 0.24 
2 ABE 0.24 
3 B D 0.20 
4 A D E 0.18 
5 B C D 0.29 
The matrix structure showed in table-2 by step2.
Table 2 Matrix of data transactions 
1 2 3 4 5
A 0 1 0 1 0
B 1 1 1 0 1
C 1 0 0 0 1
D 0 0 1 1 1
E 0 1 0 1 0
 Using step3 we can build set-enumeration tree like 
figure-1 and calculate weighted support of 1-item showed in 
table-3. Comparing with the minimum weighted support we 
can remove the infrequent itemset whose weighted support 
is less than minwsp. Then we will calculate the weighted 
dollar-usage of weighted frequent itemset, and re-sort the 
item-node in first level of the tree by the weighted 
dollar-usage see figure-2. Subsequently, we will get table-4 
and the second level of the tree according to step5 and step6. 
Table 3 1-item weighted value

>minwsp? yes yes yes yes yes 
Weighted 
dollar-usage 4.237 7.864 2.492 1.797 0.565
Combing the joint step of Apriori and order of itemset 
of the tree in figure-2, we can only get candidate 3-itemset 
and 0.194 which is less than mimwsp, so 
the iterative process is finished. 
BCD  )(BCDwsp

>minwsp? no yes yes no no no yes no no no 
weighted dollar-usage 6.7635.288 4.802
In the light of step7, we get the finally sort order of the 
items:  which is different from the result got 
from the tradition method. That is, the item’s significance in 
inventory management is really affected by the weighted 
association between items. The degree depends on the 
relative profit of items and distribution of items in specific 
transaction dataset. Of course, this kind of product’ 
significance measure can not be the sole criterion for 
inventory classification management, but it can provide 
valuable information for decision-making and improve the 
level of scientific management.

V. CONCLUSION
The key issue of inventory management is the problem 
of inventory control. Since there are many items in storage, 
we need to focus management on important items to 
improve efficiency. There are many criteria used to identify 
the importance of items, such as unit cost of product, 
availability of product, lead time, out-of- stock cost and rate 
of end-of-life. However, these criteria only consider the 
product’s own characteristics. In our algorithm, we not only 
take product’s own characteristics into account, but also the 
association between products. Then we propose a new 
inventory classification criteria based on weighted 
association rule which can provide valuable information for 
decision-making, and prove the validity of the algorithm 
through a calculation example.
