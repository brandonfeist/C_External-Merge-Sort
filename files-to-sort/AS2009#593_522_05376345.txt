I.  INTRODUCTION  
With the rapid development of computer network and 
data mining, tremendous amount of data collection and 
“golden nuggets” of knowledge mining has become more 
and more convenient. These have contributed greatly to 
business strategies, scientific and medical research. In 
reality, however, privacy-preserving in data mining is an 
unavoidable question. Sensitive information, such as 
customer buying habits, electronic medical record, bankcard 
client’s transaction behavior, will be leaked. The emergence 
of these problems brings a new challenge to data sharing and 
traditional data mining. In the process of data mining, how to 
resolve the problem of privacy- preserving has become a hot 
research topic in data mining field. 
At present, privacy-preserving data mining methods can 
be roughly divided from four aspects.  
• According to the basic strategy of original data 
hiding, they can be divided into data perturbation 
[1], query restriction and mixed strategies.  
• According to data mining techniques, they can be 
divided into association rules mining [2], 
classification and clustering mining, etc.  
• According to privacy preserving techniques, they 
can be divided into heuristic technique, encryption 
and reconfigurable technique.   
• According to distribution of data resources, they can 
be divided into privacy-preserving centralized 
database mining and privacy-preserving distributed 
database mining. 
Combining the advantages of both RSA public-key 
cryptosystem and homomorphic encryption scheme, an 
effective privacy-preserving distributed mining algorithm of 
association rules (PPDM-ARBSM), which is based on 
ARBSM algorithm [3], is proposed in this paper. A model of 
hierarchical management on the cryptogram is adopted in the 
algorithm. 
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
A.  Basic concepts 
Rule support and confidence are two important concepts 
in association rules. They respectively reflect the usefulness 
and certainty of discovered rules. That is, 
support (A?B) = P(A?B), 
confidence(A?B) = P(B ?A). 
Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold 
(min_sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min_conf) 
are called strong [4]. 
In general, association rule mining can be viewed as a 
two-step process: 
(1)Find all frequent itemsets. Support count of these 
itemsets will be no less than a predetermined minimum 
support count. 
(2)Generate strong association rules from the frequent 
itemsets. Confidences of these rules must be no less than a 
predetermined minimum confidence. 
The second step is easy to be realized on the basis of the 
first step, and they have nothing to do with a set of 
transactions database D. Therefore, the key of privacy 
preserving association rule mining lies in finding accurate 
frequent itemsets without precise access to the original data.  
In this paper, data resources distribution adopt distributed 
database models in which fragmentation schema use 
horizontal fragmentation and allocation schema is “the best 
adaptation” and non-redundant. Let S1,S2,…,St (t>2), be a set 
of sites where they respectively store local transactions 
database, D1,D2,…, Dt ,   ?t

B. RSA  public-key cryptosystem 
1) Exchangeable cryptographic algorithm 
Exchangeable cryptographic algorithm is an important 
tool on privacy-preserving protocol. As shown in the 
algorithm, for any given a set of cryptogram, K1, K2, …, Kn, 
the encrypted results are nothing to do with the encrypted 
sequences, and the probability that the encrypted results are 
the same for different information is almost zero. 
Definition 1   A cryptographic algorithm can be exchanged. 
For any given a set of cryptogram, K1, K2, …, Kn ?K and 
any given M1, M2 in an itemset M and any replacement i, j, 
the following two equations are satisfied. 
)()( 1ki1 ………… kjnkjkin EEEE =  .                            ?1?  
2121 ,, MMMMM ??? , and given kk 2
1, <?   
?<= )))(((()))((( 2111 ………… MEEprMEEpr kjnkjkinki  .      ?2? 
We say that the cryptographic algorithm can be 
exchanged. 
2) RSA public-key cryptographic algorithm 
RSA public-key cryptosystem was named after its 
inventor, R.Rivest, A.Shamir and L.Adleman. So far RSA is 
the most widely used in public-key cryptosystem. Its security 
depends on the fact of number theory that factorization of big 
integer is very difficult. 
RSA algorithm: 
a) Randomly generate two different large prime 
numbers in similar size: p and q. 
b) Compute: n=p×q and Euler function ?= (p-1)×(q-
1)? 
c) Randomly choose an integer e, 1<e<?, such that 
gcd(e, ?)=1. 
d) Calculate an unique integer d such that  e×d?1 
(mod ?). 
e) Obtain: (n, e) is public-key (i.e., encryption key).  d 
is private key (i.e. ,decryption key). 
f) Encrypt: c=me mod n where m is the information 
(that is, plaintext), and c is ciphertext. 
g) Decrypt: m=cd mod n. 
In RSA algorithm, n, e, d  are called modular, encryption 
exponent and decryption exponent, respectively. In [5], 
under the premise that large prime numbers p and q are 
determined, the conclusion that RSA public-key 
cryptographic algorithm satisfies the exchangeability has 
been proved in detail.  Any cryptographic algorithm, which 
satisfies (1) (2), can be applied to the PPDM-ARBSM 
algorithm presented in this paper. 
C. Homomorphic encryption scheme 
Sander and Tschudin defined additive-multiplicative 
homomorphic encryption scheme (HES) in the integer ring. 
Common addition and multiplication are homomorphic in 
the integer ring, and therefore homomorphic encryption 
scheme in the integer ring is easy. Here, we give a brief 
sketch of a type of HES[6]. 
Let R and S be integer rings. If there exist PLUS 
algorithm and MULT algorithm such that 
E(a + b)= PLUS(E(a),E( b)), 
E(a×b)= MULT(E(a), E(b)). 
where R  represent plaintext data, S represent ciphertext 
data, a, b?R, E is an encryption function(E:R?S), we called 
they satisfies additively homomorphic and multiplicatively 
homomorphic, respectively. According to the above, we can 
construct encryption and decryption algorithms and perform 
computation. 
Encryption algorithm: 
 E(x)=(x+ r×q ) mod n                                   (function 1) 
where p and q are two large prime numbers, r is a random 
integer, n=p × q, PLUS is common addition, MULT is 
common multiplication. 
Decryption algorithm:    x=E-1(y)= y mod q,  y=E(x). 
Notice that there is one to many relationship between 
plaintext x and ciphertext E(x) (i.e., for any x, although E1(x)
? E2(x), D(E1(x))=D(E2(x))). 
III. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ARBSM ALGORITHM 
In ARBSM algorithm [3], we has given two important 
definitions as follows and related properties (properties is 
abbreviated). 
Definition 2 Similarity  For an Boolean matrix of 
transaction mnA ×= )a( ij , similarity of transactions Tl and 
Tk is defined as the number that the values of corresponding 
column are 1 for two distinct rows Al  and Ak,  l ? k . That is, 
Sim(Tl ,Tk)=?(ali ?aki)?where l?k and i=1,2, … , m. 
Definition 3  Similarity matrix of transactions   For an 
Boolean matrix of transactions mnA ×= )a( ij , similarity 
matrix of transactions S is defined as    S=AAT. 
ARBSM algorithm steps: 
•  Construct Boolean matrix of transaction A. 
•  Compress A. 
•  Calculate similarity matrix of transactions S. 
•  Calculate directly K frequent itemsets. 
IV. PPDM-ARBSM ALGORITHM 
Combining the advantages of both the RSA public-key 
encryption and homomorphic encryption, an effective 
privacy preserving distributed mining algorithm of 
association rules (PPDM-ARBSM), which is based on 
ARBSM[3], is proposed in this paper. In the following 
discussion, first, the PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework is 
proposed. Next, we will give integrated algorithm of PPDM-
ARBSM. 
A. PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework 
Suppose that there are t sites S1?S2?…?St where t>2. 
They respectively store local transactions database D1,D2,…
,Dt, where ?t

i
=
=

DD ,i=1,2, … ,t. PPDM-ARBSM 
algorithm framework is shown in Fig.1. 
295
 
Figure 1.   PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework. 
Then we illustrate all the symbols which appear in Fig.1. 
IDi is dynamic password identity authentication of site Si. 
Eei(qi) represent that prime number qi in HES of Si was 
encrypted with public key ei. Ei(Ai) represent that Boolean-
matrix Ai was encrypted with HES. Ddi(Ci) represent that Ci 
sent from site Si was decrypted with private key di, and let 
their encrypted result be qi. 
In the PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework, we 
introduce the concepts of cryptosystem management server 
(CMS), data mining server (DMS). The encrypted and 
decrypted process of the whole algorithm is described below. 
(1)CMS?Si: IDi, ei ; CMS?DMS: di 
CMS generate separately dynamic password identity 
authentication of site Si, public key and private key password 
pairs (ei, di) using pseudorandom generator technique and 
RSA public-key cryptographic algorithm, and send IDi and ei 
to DMS. 
(2) Si?DMS : Ei(Ai), Eei(qi)=Ci 
First, each Si chooses two large prime numbers in similar 
size: P and q. Then?each Si encrypts Ai with  Ei (function 
1), and encrypts qi with public key ei of Si, and the result is 
Ci. 
(3) DMS? Ddi(Ci)=qi, Ai=E-1(y)=y mod qi , y=Ei(Ai) 
First, DMS decrypts separately Ci with corresponding 
private key di of RSA, and the result is qi. Finally, DMS 
decrypts Ei(Ai) with qi, the result is Ai. 
B. Integrated mining algorithm of PPDM-ARBSM 
Algorithm 1: PPDM-ARBSM 
Input: t site S1, S2,… , St, where t >2. 
Output: Lk, k-frequent itemsets in a database of 
transactions D. 
Step 1 //CMS Identity Authentication

for (i=1; i<=t ; i++) 
?Generate (ei,di) using RSA algorithm;

Step 3  
 //for each site, Ai compression and RSA encryption 
Scan each site Si (i<=t);

Compress each Ai (i<=t); //Using conclusion 1-3 in [3]. 
for (i=1; i<=t ; i++)  
?Choose two large security primes pi, qi ; 
    Generate a random number ri; 
    Ei(Ai);  //encrypt Ai with HES 
Ci =Eei(qi); // encrypt qi with public key ei of RSA 
    Delete pi, ri; // ri  is a random integer 
Transport Ei(Ai), Ci to DMS; 
? 
Step 4  
//DMS decryption and k-frequent itemsets generation 
for (i=1; i<=t ; i++) 
?qi= Ddi(Ci); 
      Ai=E-1(y)=y mod qi, y=Ei(Ai); 
A=A?Ai; 
? 
Compress A; 
ARBSM(A); 
Lk=?Lk;  
Return  Lk ? 
V. ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF ALGORITHM 
The purpose of privacy-preserving data mining is to 
discover accurate, useful and potential patterns and rules 
without precise access to the original data. Therefore,  
evaluating a privacy-preserving data mining algorithm often 
requires three key indicators, such as privacy (security), 
accuracy and efficiency. 
Privacy: In this paper, cryptogram management at 
different levels was adopted in PPDM-ARBSM algorithm. 
First, site Si encrypts Ai with Ei (function 1) of HES. Then, 
site Si encrypts encryption parameter qi of HES with public 
key ei of RSA. Hence, the algorithm can improve safety as 
well as increase efficiency. 
Accuracy: DMS, which decrypts, compresses and 
conflates Boolean-matrix of transactions, and quickly 
generate global K-frequent itemsets using similarity matrix 
of transactions, is set in the algorithm. The whole process of 
algorithm keeps the authenticity of original data. The 
algorithm does not cause the decreases in accuracy for 
improving safety. 
Efficiency: Raising efficiency of the algorithm is mainly 
shown the decreases in time complexity. PPDM-ARBSM 
algorithm reduces the time complexity mainly in two 
aspects. First, global K-frequent itemsets are quickly 
generated in order to prevent generating local frequent 
itemsets and greatly cut down communication costs of 
contrasting local support between sites. Second, tremendous 
296
amount of Boolean-matrix Ai in site Si was encrypted with 
HES and we only have to encrypt encryption parameter qi of 
HES with public key ei of RSA. So, the algorithm avoids 
numerous exponent operations and improves the speed of 
operation greatly. 
VI. EXPERIMENTS 
We carry on simulation experiments in PPDM-ARBSM 
algorithm and ARBSM algorithm using approximate 50 
thousand sample data in standard simulating data sets 
provided by Almaden Research Center of IBM in order to 
test executive efficiency of the two algorithms. The results 
are shown in Fig.2. 
As shown in Fig.2, the higher K value is, the more 
efficient generation of K-frequent itemsets can be. PPDM-
ARBSM algorithm which adopts a model of hierarchical 
management on the cryptogram costs much more running 
time than ARBSM algorithm, and causes the decreases in 
efficiency of mining. However, this is quite acceptable.

a model of hierarchical management on the cryptogram, is 
proposed in this paper. The algorithm can enhance strong 
points and avoid weaknesses. As shown in the theoretical 
analysis and the experimental results, the algorithm can
