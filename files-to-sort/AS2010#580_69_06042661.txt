Abstract
Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems still face
the problem of low precision of system results. To improve
the precision of such systems, many image visual extractors
have been developed and employed to represent the ima-
ges. However, the usage of a large number of extractors and
consequently, a large number of features, leads to the “di-
mensionality curse”, where the retrieval performance and
the query accuracy diminish. In this paper, we propose a
new method, called Statistical Fractal-scaled Product Me-
tric (SFPM), to maximize the accuracy of CBIR systems and
speedup similarity queries. The SFPM method combines
association rule mining and the Fractal-scaled Product Me-
tric (FPM) [4], to determine a reduced set of features and
appropriate scale factors in multi-descriptor image simila-
rity assessment. The FPM is an unsupervised method to
determine a scale factor among features in multi-descriptor
image similarity assessment based on the Fractal Theory.
Experiments have shown that SFPM reduced the feature
vector size in up to 65% and improved in up to 27% the
query precision when comparing with the use of the FPM te-
chnique. The results show that the proposed method SFPM
is effective in determining a reduced set of features and a
near-optimal set of scale factors for the descriptors invol-
ved, and it is well-suited to improve the quality of content-
based query in CBIR systems.
1. Introduction
The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
(DICOM) standard allows storing the study information
with the image. In this context, the development of picture
archiving and communication system (PACS) has contribu-
ted to the effective use of digital images in diagnosing as
well as training new physicians. In order to be effectively
useful, image retrieval in PACS should be fast and consis-
tent with the specialist expectation. Hence, content-based
image retrieval (CBIR) techniques have been intensively re-
searched in the last years.
Most queries in a PACS are based on metadata. Howe-
ver, querying images based on their visual characteristics
has proven to be a suitable complement to text-based se-
arch. For instance, visual features not only allow the retrie-
val of cases where patients have similar diagnoses, but also
the identification of cases with visual similarity but different
diagnoses [13]. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is
a technology that helps to manage digital picture archives
organized by their visual content [9].
To obtain the visual representation of the images, they
are submitted to image processing algorithms, which gene-
rate a mathematical signature describing the properties of
the image content. Thereafter, the signatures can be com-
pared through a function to measure the similarity between
them, yielding performing queries based on similarity cri-
teria. One of major challenge of CBIR systems is the low
precision of the systems results. One way of improving the
query accuracy is to employ various feature extractors to
describe the image content. However, uncontrolled incre-
ase of the features into a composite vector may degrade the
performance and the precision of the results as well. Com-
bining multiple descriptors requires a strategy that both ena-
bles employing the best integration between the binomial
feature extractor-distance function for each descriptor, and
states a proper balance of the descriptors in the similarity
calculations. However, the methods for weighting multiple
descriptors encountered in the literature are either based on
978-1-4244-9166-7/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 
exhaustive experimentation or in supervised techniques.
In this paper we present a new method to improve
the CBIR precision and speedup similarity queries. This
method combines association rule mining and the Fractal-
scaled Product Metric (FPM), to determine a reduced set of
features and a set of scale factors in multi-descriptor image
similarity assessment. The association rule mining is em-
ployed to perform feature selection in each descriptor set,
and the FPM method is employed to balance these redu-
ced multi-descriptors. The FPM method is based on the
intrinsic dimensions of the feature spaces, approximated by
their respective fractal dimensions. Moreover, the compo-
site distance function enables using scalable access methods
to speed up data searching. Experiments have shown that
the proposed method is effective in determining a reduced
set of features and a near-optimal set of scale factors for the
descriptors involved and, also, the method always improves
the precision of the results.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 introduces the basic concepts for the paper and the
main related work. The proposed method is described in
Section 3.2. Section 4 shows results of some of the experi-
ments performed to evaluate the proposed method. Finally,
Section 5 presents the conclusions and future work.
2. Background and Related Work
In CBIR, image retrieval is mainly performed regarding
similarity. The basic types of similarity queries are the k-
nearest neighbor query and the range query. Similarity que-
ries are performed comparing the feature vectors using a
distance function - or dissimilarity function - to quantify
how close (or similar) two vectors are.
Several distance functions can be considered, e.g., the
Minkowski function family (including the well-known Eu-
clidean distance function), the Mahalanobis distance func-
tion and the cosine function. Two crucial issues in the CBIR
systems are: first, how to define a signature (feature vector)
that represents the image content; second, how to compute
the similarity between a pair of images based on their sig-
natures. [9].
The visual properties of an image are commonly descri-
bed in terms of color, texture and shape. These descriptors
are extracted by image processing algorithms either glo-
bally for the entire image or locally for regions of interest,
defined manually or by a segmentation algorithm. These
algorithms, called feature extractors, compute a number of
values, usually numeric, that compose the signatures repre-
senting the images, also referred to as feature vectors. There
are many image feature extractors documented in the litera-
ture, such as the histogram for color, the Haralick descrip-
tors for texture and the Zernike moments for shape [1].
In most real situations, employing various feature ex-
tractors to describe the image content improve the accuracy
of the results because they provide complementary charac-
teristics that contribute to the representation of the image
content. However, the usage of a large number of extrac-
tors and consequently, a large number of features, leads to
the “dimensionality curse”, where the retrieval speed and
the query accuracy diminish. Consequently, suitable appro-
aches to combine feature extractors without degrading the
results are needed.
A suitable approach to combine multiple descriptors
computes the similarity for each of them in a base level and
then aggregates the partial similarities using a composition
function. Let any image x be represented by a set of n des-
criptors x1, . . . , xn, each generated by a feature extraction
algorithm, and ?1, . . . , ?n be distance functions defined over
the domains of the respective descriptors. The composition
distance function ? between two images x, y is a combi-
nation of the individual distances ?i(xi, yi), usually given
by:
?(x, y) =
n?
i=1
wi · ?i(xi, yi) (1)
where wi is the weight assigned to the respective descrip-
tor. Several systems employed this strategy [11, 7], but the
main drawback of such systems is that they determine the
weights of each component by means of exhaustive search.
Some approaches were proposed relying either on relevance
feedback cycles [10] or on supervised techniques[6]
Metric spaces are more adequate to represent multime-
dia data, as they only require the elements and their pairwise
distances [19]. A metric space is formally defined as a pair
?S, ??, where S is a data domain and ? is a metric. A me-
tric is a distance function that satisfies the following metric
axioms, ?x, y, z ? S:
1. symmetry: ?(x, y) = ?(y, x);
2. non-negativity: 0 < ?(x, y) < ? if x ?= y and
?(x, x) = 0;
3. triangular inequality: ?(x, y) ? ?(x, z) + ?(z, y).
Therefore, both adimensional1 and dimensional data can
be represented in a metric space, being sufficient to define
proper metrics to compare the data.
The usage of a metric distance to compute the dissimila-
rity between images also enables to adopt a Metric Access
Method (MAM) to speed up the similarity queries execu-
tion. There are many MAMs proposed [12], likeM-Tree [8]
and Slim-tree [17]. Experimental evaluation has shown that
MAMs are very effective for indexing image data, achieving
superior performance and scalability than other structures.
1Adimensional data are those for whom no dimensionality can be as-
signed.
Having introduced the basic concepts, we present our
new method to improve CBIR systems combining multiple
extractors in the next section.
3. Proposed Method: SFPM
The proposed method Statistical Fractal-scaled Product
Metric (SFPM) is a technique that maximizes the query ac-
curacy in the same time that minimizes the number of featu-
res employed to perform the query. The method combines
a statistical approach to perform feature selection and an
approach based on fractal theory to find the most suitable
weight of features, according to their distinguishing power.
The SFPMmethod employs the Fractal-scaled Product Me-
tric (FPM), wich is based on the intrinsic dimensions of the
feature spaces, approximated by their respective fractal di-
mensions. The composite weight set and the selected fea-
tures enable the use of scalable access methods to speed up
data searching.
The method SFPM is illustrated in Figure 1. The images
from the database are submitted to a set of feature extrac-
tors. Each image is represented by set of feature vectors
which are submitted to a feature selection process through
the StARMiner algorithm (as described in the next subsec-
tion), producing a reduced set of features for each extractor,
i.e. producing reduced feature vectors regarding their di-
mensionality. The properties of the reduced feature vectors
are analyzed using the fractal theory by the FPM method,
as described in Section 3.2, producing scale factors for the
multi-descriptors. Finally, the reduced feature vectors and
the scale factors are employed in the CBIR system to exe-
cute the similarity queries asked by the user, improving the
precision of the result and the speed of the query execution.
3.1 Statistical Association Rules for Fea-
ture Selection
The SFPM method employs an algorithm, named StAR-
Miner [14], to mine statistical association rules from a da-
taset. The mined rules are used to select the most relevant
features, making a new and enhanced representation of the
images.
Let T be a dataset of medical images, x an image class,
Tx ? T the subset of images of class x and F a feature. Let
µF (Z) and ?F (Z) be, respectively, the mean and standard
deviation of the values of feature F in the subset of ima-
ges Z. The algorithm uses three thresholds defined by the
user: ?µmin - the minimum allowed difference between
the average of the feature F in images from class x and the
average of F in the remaining dataset; ??max - the ma-
ximum standard deviation of F values allowed in a given
class and; ?min - the minimum confidence to reject the hy-
pothesisH0. StARMiner algorithm mines rules of the form
x ? F , if the conditions given in Equations 2, 3 and 4 are
satisfied.
µf (Tx)? µf (T ? Tx) ? ?µmin (2)
?f (Tx) ? ??max (3)
H0 : µf (Tx) = µf (T ? Tx) (4)
In Equation 4, H0 should be rejected with a confidence
equal to or greater than ?min, in favor of the hypothesis that
the means µf (Tx) and µf (T ? Tx) are statistically diffe-
rent. A rule x ? F , returned by the algorithm, relates a
feature F with a class x, where values of F have a statisti-
cally different behavior in images of class x. This property
indicates that F is an interesting feature to distinguish ima-
ges of class x from the remaining images. Therefore, the
feature selection performed in our approach is: The set S
of relevant features are composed of the features F present
in the rules returned by StARMiner. These features have a
particular and uniform behavior in images of a given class.
3.2 Fractal-scaled Product Metric (The
FPM method)
Feature extractors produce signatures comparable th-
rough metrics, so each one generates a metric space. The
standard way of aggregating nmetric spacesMi = ?Si, ?i?,
1 ? i ? n, is defining a metric over the cartesian product
M1 ×M2 × ...×Mn, which is called a product metric.
The Fractal-scaled Product Metric (FPM) method [4]
calculates the scale factors (the weights wi of Equation
1) between the composed metrics based on the correlation
fractal dimension D2 of each original metric space created
by the extracted descriptors. Knowing D2 of a dataset al-
lows predicting its properties as being similar to that of a
dimensional dataset with approximately the same embed-
ded dimension[3].
The main idea of the FPM is to identify the contribu-
tion for the overall similarity calculation of each descriptor.
Since the value of the intrinsic dimension reveals the pre-
sence of correlations among the attributes of a dataset, the
fractal dimension provides an estimate of a lower bound for
the number of features needed in a similarity search to keep
the essential of data information.
Therefore, scaling the multiple descriptors in the pro-
duct metric by their intrinsic dimensions approximated by
the value ofD2, neither overestimate nor underestimate the
contribution of each descriptor in the similarity assessment.
The correlation fractal dimension can be calculated using
the Box Counting method [15, 18] or using the technique
proposed in [16].
The FPM method performs normalization to reduce the
effects of the range difference in the similarity computation.

To do so, it uses the largest known distance dmaxi for each
descriptor. In summary, the FPM metric is given by:
?(x, y) =
n?
i
D2i ·
?i(xi, yi)
dmaxi
(5)
The values of dmaxi can be measured by computing the
distances between all pairs of elements considering each
descriptor, but this operation is quadratic on the number of
elements. However, cheaper techniques can be employed to
estimate this value. For example, if a MAM is indexing the
data referred to the descriptor i, it is feasible to get a close
approximation stating dmaxi as the diameter of the region
covered by the MAM’s root node. Refer to paper [5] to a
more complete discussion of the notion of scaling metric
spaces using fractals.
4. Experiments
This section presents results of experiments performed
to evaluate the proposed method. The software developed
was implemented in C++ using the Slim-tree MAM [17],
available in the Arboretum2 library to index data. To per-
form the experiments we have used medical image datasets
provided by the Clinical Hospital of the Medical School of
Ribeirao Preto, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil.
The first dataset used, called MRI 704, consists of 704
images of images of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
exams. The dataset is divided in 40 classes according to
the region of body examined, the slice position and the type
2Available at http://gbdi.icmc.usp.br/arboretum
of specified section. Each image of the MRI 704 database
was processed by two feature extractors: Haralick’s Texture
and Zernike moments, that contains the first 256 moments
of Zernike describing the image shapes.
The second dataset (2), called CT Lung ROIs, consists
of 3257 images, containing Regions of Interest (ROIs) of
images of Computed Tomography (CT) lung exams, and it
is organized in 6 classes, being one normal and 5 of abnor-
mal patterns. These images were processed using the Ha-
ralick’s Texture and the first 256 moments of Zernike. The
Manhattan distance (L1) was used in all experiments.

database.
4.1. Results
We employed Precision versus Recall (P×R) graphs [2]
to evaluate the quality of the query results. The recall of
a query is calculated as: recall = |Ra||R| , where |Ra| is the
number of relevant elements retrieved and |R| is the number
of relevant elements that should be retrieved. The precision
of a query is given by: precision = |Ra||A| , where |Ra| is the
number of relevant elements retrieved and |A| is the size of
the answer set. A simple way to interpret a P×R curve is
the closer the curve to the top, the better the technique.
The first step of SFPM is the StARMiner feature selec-
tion process, which performed a significant reduction in the
number of features of the feature vectors. StARMiner mi-
nes rules relating image classes and the most discrimina-
tive features. The feature selection process performed by
StARMiner removes the noise and redundant features that
interferes negatively in the query result, not only speeding
up the whole process, but also improving the query preci-
sion. Regarding the MRI 704 dataset, the StARMiner se-
lected 86 from the 256 original set of features generated
by Zernike extractor, and 90 from the 140 features gene-
rated by the Haralick texture descriptor. When analyzing
the CT Lung ROIs, StARMiner selected 123 from the 256
initial set of Zernike features, and 80 from the 140 initial
texture features. The feature selection step of SFPM per-
formed a reduction of up to 65% in the feature vector size,
making the content-based search faster and also more accu-
rate.
Figure 3 shows the P×R graph comparing the retrie-
val quality of employing each individual descriptor of the
MRI 704 database, the combination of original descriptors
using the FPM method, and the results obtained with the
proposed method, the SFPM. The SFPM method outperfor-
med the individual descriptors and the FPM method in all
recall levels, having improved in some of them the preci-
sion up to 15% over using only the Zernike descriptor, up
to 157% over using only the Haralick descriptor and up to
14% over FPM method.
The Figure 4 shows the results of the same kind of expe-
riment with the CT Lung ROIs database, showing the P×R
graph of the invidual descriptors, FPM applied on original
descriptors, and the results obtained with SFPM method.
Again, the SFPM method achieved better results in all re-
call levels, with precision improvements of up to 75% over
using only the Zernike descriptor, up to 47% over using only
the Haralick descriptor and up to 27% over FPMmethod, in
some recall levels.
5. Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we proposed the Statistical Fractal-scaled
Product Metric (SFPM) method to improve the quality
of content-based query in CBIR systems. The proposed
method combines association rule mining and the Fractal-
scaled Product Metric (FPM) technique to determine a re-
duced set of features and a set of scale factors for multi-
descriptor image similarity evaluation.

up to 65%, and improved the precision of the queries in
up to 157% regarding the usage of only a feature extractor.
Also, the SFPM method improves in up to 27% the query
precision when comparing with the use of the FPM techni-
que.
Future work includes testing different distance functions
and image descriptors with the proposed method, and tes-
ting other product metrics to combine multiple descriptors.
