I. INTRODUCTION
With the development of society and the need of 
modernization, the City Operational System has accumulated 
lots of useful data, and it has become a focal point in this field 
that how to find knowledge and make a strategic decision. 
Compared with available mass monitoring data, the potential 
symptoms of accidents are “small samples” information models. 
How to find these symptoms in the mass monitoring data of the 
City Operational System is crucial and important to prevent the 
accidents happening. 
Data Mining is a progress in which the potential knowledge 
is found. Compared with numerous data, outlier data are those 
that are small but obviously deviated from the other data, not 
meet the general pattern or behavior of the data, and may be 
noise or the reflection of nature of the data. But outlier data 
may contain more valuable information than normal data, so 
they should be studied as important data also. Outlier data 
mining is an important study field of data mining, which is 
dedicated to find the objects that are significantly different 
from the other data in the data set [1]. So far, the outlier data 
mining has been widely studied and applied in many fields, 
such as weather forecasts and the time series data analysis [2]. 
This paper, combining the method of outlier data mining with 
associational rules, is about the mining and discovery of 
potential symptoms in unforeseen accidents of the City 
Operation System. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
the concept of association rules will be introduced and the 
outliers in city operation system database are analyzed. In 
section 3, an outlier mining algorithm based on association 
rules are described and relevant experiments are given to prove 
its validity. Finally the conclusions are given in section 4. 
II. BRIEF REVIEW OF ASSOCIATION RULES
Mining association rules is an important branch of data 
mining, which describes potential relations among data items in 
databases, such as attribute and variant. Since R. Agrawal put 
forward Apriori algorithm, Association rule mining becomes 
one of the most popular research in data mining [3]. Mining 
association rules can be stated as follows: 
Suppose 1 2{ , , , }mI i i i  be a set of items, let D, the 
task-relevant data, be a set of transactions, where each 
transaction T is a set of items such that T I . The quantities 
of items bought are not considered. Each transaction is 
assigned an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items, a 
transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A T . An 
association rule is an implication of the form A B , where 
A I , B I , and A B  . The rule A B  holds 
in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the 
percentage of transactions in D that contain A B . This is 
taken to be the probability, ( )P A B . The rule A B  has 
confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of 
transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken 
to be the conditional probability, ( | )P B A . That is, 
( ) ( )Support A B P A B s   
( ) ( | )
( ) / ( )
Confidence A B P B A
Support A B Support A c

  
Mining association rules is to mine strong association rules 
that satisfy the user-specified both minimum support threshold 
and confidence one. More details could be found in [4].

The function of mining association rules is analyzing the 
relation between data items, and the rules of infrequent itemsets 
and more interesting ones. In order to finish the goal of outlier 
data mining, the itemsets less than the given threshold should 
be searched upon this. 
III. OUTLIER MINING AND CITY OPERATION SYSTEM
A. Outlier Mining 
Outliers are the data that obviously deviate from others, 
disobey the general mode or behavior of data and disaccord 
with other existing data. The concrete definition is as follows: 
Supposing 1 2{ , , , }nX x x x  , 1 2{ , , , }nY y y y   are 
n-demensional vectors, where X D	 , Y D	 , and D is a 
sample set. Y is called an outlier when it satisfiers the 
following condition: * *[ ]E Y E X 
  , where 
  is outlier 
factor, and *E  is the eigen operator of the entire sample set [5]. 
Outliers may originate from measuring errors, computer 
inputting errors or man-caused errors, etc. These are usually 
called noise data. Outliers may also reflect the true properties 
of data, such as the rare disastrous weather recorded in 
meteorological database, which often contains one or more 
properties whose values seriously deviate from the normal 
values. However, these data may contain more valuable 
information than normal data. The so-called outlier mining 
means extracting outliers from the database. The discovery of 
outliers may result in some true but unexpected knowledge, 
therefore such data should be retained.  
Outlier data may be noise or interesting data of association 
rules. Therefore, the important monitoring data should be 
confirmed through interaction of experts and machine, then a 
synthetically analysis is given combining with other forecast 
methods to acknowledge whether the monitoring data is the 
potential symptoms of the City Operational System. 
B. The Outliers in Data of City Operation System 
There are mass monitoring data in the City Operation 
System, which are collected from different departments and 
fields of the city, such as traffic, weather, all kinds of water, 
electricity, windpipe line, and etc. The relations between these 
data are complicated, the change of some data may have direct 
or indirect influence on the other data. Among the mass and 
complicated data, the data which have great influence on the 
normal running of he City Operation System should be given 
due attention. However, the change of some data are not 
obvious, but the data still have some impact to the city system's 
normal running, that are the outlier data of the City Operation 
System. The traditional data forecast methods can describe and 
analyze the change trend of all kinds of data easily, but it can't 
give a quantitative express of the degree of the relation between 
the data. Therefore, the outlier mining of the City Operation 
System is obviously important. 
IV. DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM
A. Description of Algorithm 
As mentioned above, the results of the association rules 
mining, the relationships between different data can be 
obtained by solving the problem of the frequency itemsets and 
then giving appropriate thresholds of the support and 
confidence. The purpose of outlier mining is to search the data 
itemsets which meet some threshold condition. If the 
definitions of association rules miming were improved and 
some outlier conditional items were defined, the outlier data, 
namely which are different obviously from other data, could be 
mining and analyzed. 
The outlier mining algorithm based on association rules is 
described in Fig. 1 as following:

The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and the 
validity is proved in two ways in [6]. The algorithm is applied 
in the City Operation System, after some pretreatments on the 
monitoring data, and the application case is given in following 
section.
B. Application and Analysis 
The monitoring data of the City Operation System include 
traffic, weather, energy, water, and etc. Water data used to

20090804 2.65 2.83 36.86 
… … … … 
The process of the algorithm running is as follows: first, 
some parameters are set in the user interface program, then, the 
algorithm are called. The data should be selected beforehand 
and be jointed according the date. At last, the results are given 
in form of rules, and more clearer and understandable 
interpretations are given with visual graphic display. 
If a rule about the relationship between the item “coal_Sell” 
and “coal_Stock” is mined, it can be described in form of 
“coal_Sell->coal_Stock(with support 0.2 and confidence 0.3)”. 
Its visual meaning can be described in a reference frame which 
horizontal axis represents support and vertical one represents 
confidence, showed as Fig. 2: 
Figure 2. description of the visual meaning of a rule
More clearer and understandable interpretations about the 
rules can be given according the experts of City System. The 
outlier itemset is all the items which satisfied the criterion of 
outlier condition threshold. 
In practical running, this algorithm is carried out on mass 
history data. Its precisions are validated according to the 
analytical result of experts. Some precision comparison results 
are listed in Table ?:
TABLE IV. PRECISION COMPARISON RESULTS
Precision Comparison Number 
of Data Algorithm Expert 
500 77.64% 75.22% 
1000 78.31% 72.86% 
1500 79.84% 68.37% 
It can be seen from the Table ? that the precisions of 
algorithm are higher than those of expert subjective prediction. 
The comparison experiments also show that the precision of 
algorithm will be higher when the number of data is increasing, 
while the speed of mining will descend. 
V. CONCLUSIONS
The outlier mining on monitoring data of the City 
Operation System is to find the potential symptoms data which 
may endanger the City System. The potential symptoms data 
always are difficult to find or forecast by traditional data 
process method, if they are identified as noise points and 
therefore their influence on the system might be ignored. 
Therefore, the outlier data should be mined using data mining 
methods. 
The outlier mining method based on association rules is 
applied to analyze the symptoms in the mass monitoring data of 
the City Operation System in this paper, and has been applied 
in the practical city management software system successfully.
