Abstract-Most of the incremental association rule mining 
methods must rerun through processed data and have not 
made the best of the given rules. In this paper we propose an 
incremental association rules algorithm, this algorithm 
applies artificial immune theory and takes advantage of the 
given rules produced by original data set. Based on the 
quickly response during the memory cell recognizing the 
antigen, the algorithm is faster. The best rules are selected 
from the given rules as the optimum memory cell through 
promoting or inhibiting the antibodies, so the interest of the 
final rules is improved. The algorithm has better 
performance compared to FUP algorithm, especially in the 
number of the new transactions is less than half the number 
of transactions in the original data set, the time-consuming 
of the FUP algorithm is more than 10 times to this algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Association rule mining is an important area of data 
mining. An classical association rule mining algorithm was 
introduced by Agrawal et al[l], breadth-first method is 
adopted in the algorithm to produce a set of candidate 
itemsets and then frequent itemsets. J .Han come up with 
the FP-Growth algorithm[2] which need not produce the 
candidate itemsets, the database is compressed into a 
structure called FP-tree, then mining the FP-tree in the way 
of recursion, and produce the whole frequent itemsets at 
last. 
These algorithms are data mining methods in static 
database, but the database in reality is dynamic. When the 
new data are put into database, the rules based on the 
initial database can not be adapted to the updated database. 
Cheung put forward an incremental association rule 
algorithm based Apriori algorithm called Fast 
Update(FUpi3].To execute Apriori on both the new data 
set and the old data set, then compare the frequent itemsets 
produced by the two data set, to decide whether to mine 
the old data set again or not. 
The incremental association rule algorithms described 
above are executed again on the whole updated data set or 
on the data set which is composed by the new data set and 
some transactions from the old database. The algorithms 
can not take full advantage of the produced association 
rules. In this paper, an incremental association rule based

on Artificial Immune is proposed, the produced association 
rules are used to mine the new data set and then to update 
the association rule set. 
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. 
We brief review of basic knowledge in Section 2. The 
Promising incremental association rule algorithm is 
described in Section 3. We evaluate the application in 
Section 4. Finally, we conclude the work of this paper in 
section 5 
II. BASIC KNOWLEDGE 
In this paper, the Artificial Immune theory is applied 
into the association rules mining, the produced association 
rules are used during the updating of association rule set. 
We introduce some related knowledge and theory in this 
section. 
A. Association rules 
Association rule mmmg searches for interesting 
relationships among items in a given data set, the earliest 
form of association rule mining is market basket analysis. 
For instance, if customers are buying milk, how likely are 
they to also buy bread on the same trip to the supermarket? 
So, the association rule is an implication like X?Y, where 
X and Y are sets of items called itemsets, An itemset that 
contains k items is a k-itemset. 
There are two measures for each association rule 
support and confidence, where support representing the 
percentage of data samples that contains X and Y in the 
data set at the same time, which measures the statistic 
importance of the association rule. Confidence describes 
the percentage of data samples that contains X and also 
contain Y in D, which assesses the degree of certainty of 
the detected association rule. Let D be a related data set, 
count(X) is the count of samples which contain X in D, 
support(X) describes the support of X, confidence(X) is 
the confidence of X, XuY is the transaction that contain X 
and Y in D. the support and confidence of association rule 
X?Y can be described as the following expression (1) and 
(2). 
(X y) count(X u J? support => = --'---- -'-
IDI (1) 
con I e nc => = ----'---'-- '---- ----'-ifid e(X Y) sup port( Xu 
Y) 
sup port( X ) (2) 
CMCE 2010 
In the application of association rule mining, user need 
to appoint the a minimum support threshold (min_sup) and 
a minimum confidence threshold (min_cont), rules that 
satisfY both min_sup and min_conf are useful rules called 
strong, the object of association rule mining is to fmd the 
strong rules. 
B. Artificial Immune theory 
At present, more and more research focus on the 
Artificial Immune area, the works on Artificial Immune 
extend to more wide fields from theory studying, the 
research production involve computer security, 
engineering optimization, data mining, controlling, fault 
diagnosis and so on. Artificial Immune has been a focus in 
artificial intelligence field after neural network, fuzzy logic 
and evolutionary computing. 
Artificial Immune System (AIS) is from biology 
immune system, the biomimetic mechanism of AIS 
include immune recognition, immune study, immune 
memory, clone selection etc. 
Immune recognition is a critical in AIS, it's nature is to 
distinguish self and non-self. Immune recognition 
distinguishes non-self through the combination of antibody 
on lymphocyte and antigen, the intensity of the 
combination is called affinity. Accordingly, signature 
matching is used to recognize antigen in AIS, it's essence 
is to define a threshold value, and we can measure the 
matching in many ways. Immune recognition is a learning 
process as well, the result is to improve the affmity of the 
immune cell, to extend the population size and save the 
best individuality as immune memory cell. 
Immune memory is corresponding to secondary 
response and crossing response. When the antigens invade, 
Immune system will produce the antibody and remember 
the antigen, so that the immune system will response more 
efficiently and quickly when the same or the similar 
antigens come again. 
Immune control means that immune system can 
promote or inhibit the antibody through the immune 
balance functions by itself. For the antibody with higher 
affmity in the antibody population, we will examine it's 
concentration, then to decide whether put it into the 
memory cell pool or not. If the antibody has higher affmity 
and lower concentration, it will be put into the memory 
cell pool. If the antibody has higher affmity and higher 
concentration, it will be put into the memory cell pool too, 
but those antibody which has high affmity with it will be 
inhibited. With immune control the antibody population 
will contain the antibody with high affmity and keep the 
diversity of antibody. 
III. INCREMENTAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED 
ON ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE 
A. Basic Concepts 
Antigen[4] means the molecule which can be 
recognized by antibody in immunology. In Artificial 
Immune system, antigen indicates the solving problem, 
and it has distinct code for different problems. 
Antibody[4] means the receptor produced by B 
lymphocyte which react with antigen in immunology. In 
Artificial Immune system, antibody is the optimized 
solution of solving problem. 
205 
Information entropy[5], there are M antibodies, each one 
has N genes. The information entropy of the gene j on all 
antibodies is defmed by following expression (3). 
s 
Ej(M) = L - Pi) 19(pi)) 
;=1 (3) 
Where s is the number of characters in character set 
coded for gene, if binary is adopted, s is equal to 2. Pi) is 
the probability of gene i located on location j, namely the 
ratio between counts of the gene i located on the locationj 
and M The average information entropy of M antibodies 
can be defmed by the following expression (4). 
E(M)=_I IEj(M) 
N j? ? 
Affinity[4] means the intensity of combination between 
the antibody and antigen. In Artificial Immune system, it is 
the similarity defined by the distance between the two data. 
Information entropy is introduced in this paper to indicate 
the affinity between an antibody and an antigen or two 
antibodies. The affmity Avw for antibodies v and w can be 
defined by the following expression (5). 
1 
Avw = ----1 + E(2) (5) 
Adaptive function of antibody[4] is used to judge the 
antibody. To select a right adaptive function is a key 
problem of data mining based on immune. For antibody X, 
the adaptive function f(x) is defined as the following 
expression (6). 
f ( X ) = a x support( X) + b x confidence( X ) 
minsupport min confidence (6) 
Where O<a<I, O<b<l, a<b, and a+b=l. 
Concentration[5] is used to measure the diversity of 
antibody population. The concentration of antibody v can 
be defined by the following expression (7). 
C = N v v M (7) 
Where Nv is the number of antibodies whose affinity is 
higher than the affinity threshold. 
In immunology, remember cell[4] is the B cell stored in 
the immune system, so that the same or similar pathogen 
can be killed later. In this paper, the rules which has high 
adaptive value and low concentration are selected as 
remember cells to recognize the transactions inserted into 
the database later. 
To kill the pathogen, immune system need produce a 
number of B cell, while antibodies are increased. This 
procedure is called clone amplification[4] and this property 
of immune system indicates that immune system has 
adaptability. 
B. Algorithm step and algorithm description 
There are three steps in this algorithm as following. 
(I) Select antibodies as memory cell 
To compute the adaptive value by adaptive function for 
each rule in the given rule set, the affmity between 
antibodies, and then to compute the concentration of 
antibody. To select the rules with high adaptive value into 
the memory cell set, if the concentration of the selected 
antibody is higher than the concentration threshold, inhibit 
those rules whose affinity with the selected rule is higher 
than the affinity threshold. This method can keep the 
diversity and orthogonality.

(2) Update given rules 
Execute clone amplification on the rules in memory 
cell set, recognize the transactions in the new data set 
based on immune recognition. Calculate the affinity 
between rule r in M and the transactions in the new data set 
d, put the transactions whose affinity is higher than affinity 
threshold into the subset Subr Calculate the affinity 
between the left part of rule r in M and the transactions in 
the new data set d, put the transactions whose affinity is 
higher than affinity threshold into the subset Subr(l). 
According to the definition of support and confidence, 
recalculate the support and confidence for each rule based 
on the following expressions (8) and (9).

If (Ar_t>min _ afJ) then 
Put t into the sub set Subr 
If (Ar(l)-t> min _ afJ) then 
Put t into the sub set Subr(l) 
Calculate the support Sup(r) of rule r follow the 
expression (8) 
Calculate the confidence Con(r) of rule r follow 
the expression (9) 
If (Sup (r»min _support and 
Con(r»min_corifidence) then 
Put r into the rule set Rnew 
(3) Generate the new rules 
For those transactions which can not be assigned to sub 
set, we will execute any association rule mining algorithm 
to create some new rules. Calculate the support and 
confidence of the new rule in the additional data set d, if 
the support and confidence is higher than the support 
threshold and confidence threshold, put the rule into the 
updated rule set Rnew. In this paper we execute the Apriori 
algorithm on the left transactions. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
The incremental association rule mining algorithm was 
applied in the communication network alarm. The alarm 
data describe the abnormal condition of hardware or 
software during the communication network is working. 
There are 5 properties in alarm information, include alarm 
devices, alarm ports, alarm type, alarm time and alarm 
level, the value of the front 4 properties decide the value of 
the alarm level as critical alarm, important alarm, 
secondary alarm or warning alarm. To discrete the values 
of the 5 properties and then code them with integer before 
execute the algorithm. 
During the whole experiment, the threshold of 
minimum support is 0.10 and the minimum confidence is 
0.50. There are 10000 records in the original data set, the 
additional data set include 1000,2000,3000,4000 and 5000 
records respectively. Figure I describes the ratio of FUP 
and the algorithm introduced in this paper with the 
increasing of the additional data set. Commonly, the bigger 
additional data set, the more different between the 
additional data set and the original data set, so figure I 
shows that the distance between the two algorithms is 
reducing with the increasing of the additional data set. 
When the additional data set is not bigger than the original 
data set, the algorithm is efficient.

In addition, the algorithm extract the memory cell on 
the given rule set before executing the data mining on the 
additional data set. Calculate the affinity of rules and select 
the rule with high adaptive value as memory cell, so the 
rules produced by the algorithm are more interesting than 
those created by FUP. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The database is changing in reality; the rules on the 
original data set will be changed with the insertion of the 
new transactions. The aim of the incremental association 
rule mining based on Artificial Immune is to update the 
given rules with the updating of the database, and to 
discover the new rules as well. The experiment shows that 
207 
This algorithm is faster than FUP, especially when the 
additional data set is smaller than the original data set, and 
the rules would be more believable. When the additional 
data set is bigger, the efficient of the algorithm is lower. 
The reason is that what algorithm will be selected to 
produce the new rules, so we will research a more efficient 
algorithm to create new rules in the future.
