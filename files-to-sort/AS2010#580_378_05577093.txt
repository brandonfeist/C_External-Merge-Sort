Abstract—The characteristic data applied for establishing 
predicting models of pipe failure in water distribution system 
(WDS) should be examined and screened in the first place. The 
effects of different way of data processing based on a series on 
maintenance records are compared, which includes a 
classification method by Bayesian theorem, a hypothesis testing 
by analysis of variance and an association rule of data mining. 
The result shows the Bayesian theorem is applicable for 
nonparametric analysis, and can give classification limits 
intuitively. But this method may neglect the relations between 
different variates and effects. It’s proper to adopt this method 
when there are few pipe characteristics available. The analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) is able to point out the interaction of variates 
and deal with both parametric and nonparametric tests. The 
association rule can provide correlations between different 
attributes, but may also bring excessive and nonsense results and 
it appears that more detailed records are required to make use of 
this method. It is suggested that the data should be carefully 
examined in appropriate method before applied to a model.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The water distribution system has played an important role 
in maintaining the urban functionalities. To keep this system 
operated in good conditions, it needs better strategies, which 
can save funds and enhance the efficiency. While establishing 
prediction or regression models for giving strategies based on 
the maintenance records, the model should select variates such 
as those pipe attributes or environmental characteristics which 
may lead to the failure, and discard those don't make sense. If 
there are still too many variates, it's necessary to pick out those 
variates with great importance either according to their 
screening abilities or the availabilities. Kurkarni[1] related the 
probability of pipe failure to the system wide failure rate, the 
rate that specific characteristics observed on failed pipes and 
that of not failed pipes, and carried out a model based on the 
Bayesian theorem. Shridhar Yamijala[2] adopted principle 
component analysis to reduce the soil corrosivity covariates to 
transformed orthogonal covariates, and analyzed the Parameter 
significance results by Poisson generalized linear  model. Raed 
Jafar[3] applied a preliminary study of the correlation and chi-
square test to analyze the influence of the input indicators and 
divided them into 3levels. May[4] proposed an algorithm to 
develop artificial neural network models to forecast water 
quality in order to reduce the need for arbitrary judgment and 
extensive trial-and-error during model development. The 
algorithm selects inputs based on the analysis of relationship 
strength between inputs and outputs, and between redundant 
inputs. Vladan Babovic[5] applied a data mining approach to 
the modeling of water supply assets by analyzing the database 
of already occurred bursts events in order to establish a risk 
model as a function of associated characteristics of bursting 
pipe (its age, diameter, material of which it is built, etc.), soil 
type in which a pipe is laid, climatological factors (such as 
temperature), traffic loading, etc. Since the analysis of the 
characteristics (inputs, parameters) includes many different 
methods, it’s necessary to decide which one is not only able to 
make full use of the data collected and also can avoid 
redundant computing. 
This paper compares 3 different methods of selecting model 
variates including the Bayesian theorem, ANOVA and the 
association rules, and describes the appropriate situations on to 
apply these methods. The first to method are applied to the 
same case to compare and verify their classification abilities, 
and the association rule is applied to another case to test the 
suitable conditions for it. This is because the first case mainly 
consists of continuous variates and the association rule is more 
suitable for the discrete variates. 
II. THE SMALL SAMPLE CONCEPT[6] 
In classical survival analysis, once the sample failed or 
died, it would be immediately removed from the research 
population. But in the maintenance of WDS, the failed pipes, 
especially those long pipes in large diameter, are repaired and 
reused, that would induce a trouble on how to define the 
population of the repaired pipes (samples). Cooper [7] 
developed a probability-based trunk mains burst risk model 
with GIS, which divided the long pipes and surroundings into 
small pieces and tested them of all the characteristics. This

paper introduces a concept of the WDS samples similar to this 
method. A whole pipe, which used to be treated as one sample, 
is divided into small samples (e.g. 1m each sample) and 
calculated respectively. It should be emphasized that the 
samples can’t be too small, which would bring a large 
population and result in the disappearance of the statistical 
significance of the failed samples. 
According to the maintenance records, the repaired or 
replaced pipe segments are generally no longer than 1m, for the 
failures are usually pitting or circular break, caused by 
corrosion or bending forces, even the longitudinal splits are 
seldom longer than several meters.  However, after applied 1m 
samples by the survival analysis, it appears that the samples are 
so small that the population is too large to show the statistical 
significance of the failed samples.  
In this paper, the small pipe sample is set to 10m, and those 
pipes shorter than 10m are treated as one sample. 
III. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS 
Although the selection of characteristics has great influence 
on the applicability of the model, the classification may also 
play an important role in the precision of the model. For 
example, the extremely low flow rate in water pipe may cause 
the tuberculation corrosion to the pipe wall, but the difference 
of the impacts of the flow rate of 0.01m/s and 0.02m/s 
shouldn’t be significant. Considering such kind of situation, it 
is essential to classify the characteristic to different grades, like 
low and high, or medium if needed.  
According to the Bayesian theorem, the probability of 
failure at the presence of specific characteristics (c) is 
( )fnfcffc

Where the Pf is the system-wide probability of failure, the Pc/f 
is the probability of observing specified characteristics on a 
sample that failed and the Pc/nf is the probability of observing 
specified characteristics on a sample that has not failed.  Then 
the Enhancement of the Failure Rate (EFR) at the presence of a 
specific characteristic (c) can be calculated as

EFR   (2) 
Fig. 1 describes the application of this method based on the 
flow rate characteristic of specific maintenance records. It 
shows that the EFRv has kept a higher level in the region of low 
flow rate (the first negative value should be due to the small 
sample size at that flow rate), and it declines significantly as 
the cumulated percentage of pipe samples growing according 
to the increase of the flow rate. It is concluded that the low 
flow rate, which is less than 0.05m/s, has an outstanding 
enhancing effect onto the pipe failure rate. 
Further, the flow rate is classified to two classes and 
transformed to dummy variate:

IV. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE 
A 2-variates factorial ANOVA (F-test) is used to analyze if 
there are significant difference of pipe failure rate between the 
samples which have different level of characteristics, flow rate 
and traffic load. The samples are assumed to be independent to 
each other and there is no interaction between two variates. It is 
also assumed that the errors are normally distributed and the 
random variates have the same finite variances. 
In this case, the null hypothesis to be tested is that all levels 
of the flow rate and traffic load have the same effect on the 
pipe failure rate (R), expressed as: H0v: Rv1=Rv2, H0n Rn1=Rn2. 
The alternative hypothesis is H1v: Rv1?Rv2, H1n Rn1?Rn2. The 
test is carried out on R, an open-source statistic software 
package, and the result is listed in Tab. 1. 
TABLE I.  RESULTS OF ANOVA 
 df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) 
v 1 0.192 0.192 5.8464 0.01577 
n 1 0.010 0.010 0.3187 0.57252 
Residuals 1114 36.505 0.033   
Total 1116 36.707    
 
The result shows that the null hypothesis H0v is falsified 
and the H0n is approved under the significant level of ?=0.05. 
The normality is then examined by Shapiro–Wilk test and the 
homoscedasticity is examined by Bartlett test. It shows that in 
this case, the data are neither normal nor homoscedastic, so the 
 
Kruskal–Wallis test, a nonparametric alternative which does 
not rely on an assumption of normality, is adopted to examine 
the hypothesizes. The results, listed in Tab. 2, shows that the 
null hypothesis H0v is falsified and the H0n is approved again. 
TABLE II.  RESULTS OF KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST 
Data Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared df p-value 
v 5.8247 1 0.01580 
n 0.3582 1 0.5495 
 
According to the tests, the influence of different flow rate 
levels are significant, which indicates that the extremely low 
flow rate may enhance the failure rate, but that influence of 
traffic load is not supported. The test of ANOVA shows that 
the classification methods may have ignored some other 
interactions that worked in this case. In contrast, the ANOVA 
may take the interactions into account which assumed to 
between the flow rate and the traffic load in this case. However, 
it is inappropriate to test the interaction by the F-test since the 
data in this case is neither normal nor homoscedastic. 
V. ASSOCIATION RULE 
Association rule mining finds interesting associations 
and/or correlated relationships among large set of data items. 
Association rules show attribute’s value conditions that occur 
frequently together in a given dataset. In this case, there are 7 
attributes (pipe diameters, pipe materials, pavement materials, 
types of subgrade soil, traffic load levels, causes of pipe 
breakage and types of pipe failure) which contain 33items 
(value of pipe characteristics) and 45transactions (records). The 
analysis result shows that among the 480 rules, there are 
120rules of which the support is over 0.2 and the confidence is 
more than 0.9. 
Most rules are either nonsense or just reflecting objective 
facts, like the grass are paved on original soil or the traffic 
loads are low on the grass. Tab. 3 lists a few rules that make 
sense. It demonstrates that the high traffic load caused pipe 
failures are probably circular break, which has a support at 0.22 
and confidence at 0.91. Also the failures of DN200 pipes which 
buried in grass are usually due to construction damages. 
TABLE III.  SAMPLES OF ASSOCIATION RULE RESULT 
LHS RHS Sup. Conf. Lift 
High traffic 
load Circular break 0.22  0.91  1.86  
Other failure 
causes Circular break 0.42  0.95  1.94  
DN200,grass Construction damages 0.20  0.90  2.38  
 
It’s hard to select the meaningful rules in such a large group 
due to the lack of criterion and engineering experience and the 
repeat of similar rules. Another problem is that usually the 
maintenance records are too general to distinguish different 
pipe failure. Such as, the failure causes are briefly divided in to 
soil subsidence, temperature changes, construction damages 
and other courses without mentioning the transient pressure, 
the corrosion or bad installation. So the application of this 
method needs a more detailed maintenance records which 
defines as much conditions as possible. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Based on the analysis above, it may conclude as: 1) The 
Bayesian theorem is applicable for nonparametric analysis, and 
can give intuitive classification limits to the continuous variates. 
But this method may neglect the interactions between different 
variates and effects. It’s proper to adopt this method when there 
are few pipe characteristics available. This method may also 
concern the combination of multi characteristics, but that 
would lead to large amount of computing tasks. 2) The 
ANOVA is able to point out the interactions of variates and 
deal with both parametric test (F-test) and nonparametric test 
(Kruskal–Wallis test), but the test of interaction needs the 
normality and homoscedasticity of the maintenance records. 3) 
The association rules can provide correlations between 
different attributes, but most results are either nonsense or 
reflecting the objective facts, and more detailed records are 
needed to reach more practical conclusions.
