Abstract—In the current age of recession, Human 
Resource department of every organization is facing a real 
challenging task of recruiting right talent peoples who can do 
the project in different problem domain and complete it within 
timeline. The main responsibility of any HR Personnel is to 
propose right talent pool to the interviewers to save their time 
in selecting the right talent for their organization. In the talent 
pool set up phase, HR faces the problem of making a decision 
whether to include the applicant into talent pool or not. Many 
HR Tools are available to support the decision making of HR 
Personnel. However, the accuracy of decision making still can 
not satisfy the HR personnel. Here, we proposed a two tier 
intelligent based architecture consisting of talent evaluation 
engine that acts on knowledge base constituted by domain 
experts and infers the pattern needed to make more consistent 
and accurate decision. Also, we implemented the intelligent 
resume processing method which is really helpful in making a 
decision more perfect. The practical implementation of our 
system shows that accuracy of talent evaluation is very much 
improved. Our proposed system increases the job 
performance, reduces retention failure and explicit resignation. 
Keywords: Knowledge management in HR - Talent 
evaluation – InterProlog Inference Mechanism- Intelligent 
resume processing. 
I.  LITERATURE SURVEY 
 
With the increasing number of job portals, it become 
mandatory for the HR personnel to use more accurate talent 
evaluation applications for finding right workforce to their 
company. For any business, it is very important to have 
competitive multi talented workforce human resource for 
tackling any economic challenges. Most of the talent 
evaluation applications are based on the data mining [1][2], 
fuzzy clustering [3], neuro and rough set theory[5]. 
However, it is difficult for HR personnel to use these 
methods at early stage of selection. Any wrong decision of 
HR, the selection may go wrong and can add up wasted 
training expenses for the company. Recently, a number of 
studies have been proposed to evaluate the talent of 
applicant and recruit the people for the right job based on 
the evaluation. We have conducted investigation on talent 
evaluation systems and architecture that can be matched 
with our proposed system. A HR talent evaluation system 
[1] is constructed by integrating the data mining methods 
such as association rule and decision tree. Most of the 
association rules are inferred from the available facts in 
database. Sometimes a valid association rule may be missed 
due to poor support and confidence for that rule. Hybrid 
data mining technique [3] [6] has been adopted in 
semiconductor manufacturing for solving engineering and 
yield problem. Only few studies have been done for talent 
evaluation. Other than the data mining such as neural 
network, support vector machine and statistical methods [4] 
are block boxes to the decision makers. This type of system 
is not particularly useful for the human resource 
management application 
.   
II. DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF TWO TIER 
INTELLIGENT AGENT BASED ARCHITECTURE 
 
According to different functionality, our proposed 
architecture can be divided into two main phase Back End 
(Figure 1) and Front End (Figure 2). 
 
A.Back End Phase of Architecture: 
 Two main major modules of the Back End phases 
are Data pre processing and pattern mining. In this phase, 
we perform Data preprocessing and mining on employee 
profile of company to capture well known pattern and after 
that we enrich the patterns as well as add the valid 
additional rules with the help of domain expert. For any job 
posting by the recruiter, HR domain expert prepares the 
valid rules based on his/her expert knowledge and also from 
the inferred pattern. These valid rules need to be matched 
with the applicant. 
1.Data Preprocessing: 
 Mostly human resource data are sensitive and 
stored in different place. Before performing the mining, data 
preprocessing is required to ensure rich quality data.1.Data 
Selection: We selected the data from the employee profile 
for assisting the mining. Our mining targets the three 
important attributes.

They are performance of employee, retention failure 
and explicit resignation. We select the data and load it in the 
schema show in Table 1 .2. Data Cleaning: We excluded 
the attribute such as age, gender and martial status to avoid 
discrimination of employees from profile schema. 3. Data 
Enrichment: College attribute of Profile is enriched by 
categorizing the studied colleges into A, B and C 
category.4.Data Transformation: We used the relational 
table format which confines to the schemas in Table 1 for 
loading the data. We have developed the performance 
review component in our system. It analysis the each 
employees based on the performance attributes such as 
technical expertise, Team working behavior and interest in 
knowledge improvement. This component generates the 
grade value for each employee and stores it in the 
Performance schema. A retention rate is a critical issue 
since most of the companies invest a lot on new employee. 
According to HR experience, if one employee quits the job 
within 6 months of probation period then recruitment 
process is failed and investment training is wasted. We 
prepared the profile of employee who left the company 
within 1 year. We recorded reason for the retention failure 
in the Retention schema. When company employee resigns 
the job explicitly as of his own, The HR and immediate 
manager of that employee should interview him and record 
reason such as internal exit or external pull in the explicit 
schema. 
2. HR Domain Experts and Mined Pattern: 
  In the mining step of Back End Phase, We applied 
association rule mining on the loaded data by joining the 
different schemas. Association rule is the correlation 
between one set of item with another set of item. During the 
Association rule mining, candidate rule discovered should 
satisfy the minimum support of 85% and confidence of 
65%.If any candidate rule comes close to support then it is 
given to domain expert for validation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
A java based data mining system is developed to 
implement the data mining alogirthm.We used Apriori 
algorithm to analyze all the dataset. Excerpts of interesting 
patterns inferred from the loaded data source using our 
method are shown below. By joining the performance and 
profile schema, we can derive a good employee profile as in 
the rule1 with excellent support and confidence. With the 
help of knowledge elicitation component, all the mined 
rules and domain expert contributed rules are translated into 
prolog notation form and added to knowledge base. The 
observed piece of evidence can be stored as prolog facts. 
B. Front End Phase of Architecture: 
In the Front End phase of our system as shown in Fig.2, 
job seeker submits the resume to tagger. it converts the 
resume to XML tagged resume and all facts extracted from 
tagged resume are loaded into knowledge base. When a HR 
Query is received, our Talent Evaluation Inference 
Engine (TEIE) runs the applicant facts against the rule base 
formulated in the knowledge base by the Back End. TEIE 
captures the candidate based on the valid match count and 
suggest a list to HR Personnel.1.Tagger: It’s is an 
intelligent resume processing component that acts on the 
applicant resume and generates the XML tagged resume 
which is confined to the tagged resume XML DTD. 
XQUERY are executed on XML tagged resume to do the 
Knowledge Elicitation.2.Talent Evaluation Inference 
Engine: The main role of the IEIE is to evaluate each 
applicant resume against already built knowledge base and 
choose the applicants who attain the maximum number of 
matches. We formulate the rule base gathered from mining 
and domain expert in such a way that each applicant resume 
checked against the rule.TEIE is designed to infer the facts 
following Top down inference mechanism. Additionally, 
Job seeker can post query to TEIE to find right job opening 
match to their resume. InterProlog provides Java with the 
ability to call any prolog goal through a prolog object and 
for prolog to invoke any java method through a java 
message predicate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III DATA ANALYSIS REPORT 
 
Our proposed online base system was examined on Vee 
Technologies company dataset which is affiliated to our 
college. We tested our Back End of the system on total of 
510 employees who hired from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. We 
traced their performance, retention failures and explicit 
resignation to explore rules. These rules are enriched with 
the help of domain expert and constructed more precise 
knowledge base. Here, the Performance of talent evaluation 
analyzed based on accuracy of talent pool, improvement of

interview. According to equation 1, graph (Fig.3) is 
projected to show selection accuracy % in each interview 
level.HR Personnel’s are satisfied with 80% above 
accuracy. In addition, we have analyzed how the job 
performance, retention failure and explicit resignation 
parameters are improved for the employees who were 
recruited through our TEIE system on Jan 1st, 2009 as 
shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure.6.

processing to select and present the right talent to the 
interviewer. We have shown how our system increases the 
accuracy, job performance and reduces retention failure and 
explicit resignations. This practical implementation shows 
that it really satisfy the HR personnel. In future, we would 
like to devise a perfect architecture for building a 
knowledge base and let it to serve HR personnel with more 
excellent accuracy.
