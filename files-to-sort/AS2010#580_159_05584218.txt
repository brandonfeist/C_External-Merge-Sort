Abstract—Addresses are one of the most popular geographical 
reference systems in natural language. Addresses are 
considered as the most effective approach to bridging the gap 
between business data in management information system 
(MIS) and GIS, which supports geospatial information 
visualization and spatial analysis. One significant problem in 
Chinese address geocoding is the irregular address expressions, 
which makes it impossible to get a nationwide address content 
standardization. In order to solve this problem, this paper 
presents an approach to automatically extraction and 
visualization of address models. In this approach, we focus on 
the binary relationship between two address elements rather 
than address templates. Based on the classification of address 
elements and splitting of large- scale Chinese addresses, we use 
boolean association rules to induce address models. The 
experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is 
more flexible and practical in analyzing Chinese address 
structures for geocoding service.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Address geocoding, often abbreviated as geocoding, is 
defined as the processing of converting street addresses into 
map coordinates [1]. Therefore, the aim of geocoding 
process is to generate a geographical location (longitude and 
latitude) from street address information in the data source. 
Once geocoded, the data can be used for further processing, 
in spatial data mining projects, and it can be visualized and 
combined with other data using Geographical Information 
Systems ?GIS?[2]. So the process of geocoding forms a 
basic fundamental component of spatial analysis in a wide 
variety of research disciplines and application domains. 
Generically, geocoding works in three stages [3]. First, 
the input address data must be analyzed and structured 
according to some template (this is also called address 
model), in a parsing stage. Second, compares the structured 
address data with the contents of the addressing database, 
using several different geocoding methods. This is also 
called matching part. Third, a location is determined 
according to the results of the matching stage.  
All the three parts are well solved in many western 
countries and are now a standard functionality of commercial 
GIS softwares (e.g. ArcGIS and MapInfo). However, 
geocoding in China has been a persistent problem ever since 
1990s [1]. One of the big challenges in Chinese geocoding is 
the complexity in the Chinese address structures, which 
hindered the geocoding work in the first step (the parsing 
step).  
Here we present a method to analyzing the structure of 
address components which is also called address models. 
The models we get can serve in address standardization, 
parsing and matching works. 
II. BACKGROUND 
Addresses are used to uniquely identify particular points 
of interests, to access and deliver to specific locations, and as 
a means of positioning geographic data based on location. 
They are widely used by the state and local government and 
the public. Most organizations maintained their own list of 
addresses on their own usage purpose. In order to facilitate 
the exchange of address information, the federal geographic 
data committee (FGDC) had passed an address data content 
standard [4], which clearly defined address metadata, address 
structure, address type and so on. 
Address models are constructed on the basis of address 
elements which are discrete units of address information. In 
western countries, address components are clearly grouped , 
like: street name, street type, direction, unit number, zones, 
door number, building number, neighborhood, city, state, 
country and so on[3]. Address models are often been 
considered as simple hierarchical structures. In ArcGIS’ 
Geocoding package, there are totally 32 address locator 
styles, from single field locator to addresses with zip and 
altname locator. The rich choice on locator styles makes the 
geocoding system more flexible and adaptive to different 
addresses formats, more practical in different geocoding 
service.   
Unlike the situation in western countries, Chinese 
addresses have evolved over hundreds of years, under the 
control of thousands jurisdictions, stored in different formats 
and database files, all these factors lead to the particular 
complex geoprocessing and modeling works. Therefore 
getting address templates from complex address datasets is a 
big challenge. Research has been done during all these years. 
The idea of changing the whole address naming systems 
aims to solve the irregular address naming problem at the 
root [5]. However, it is not operative considering time and 
costs. Some used finite automata to imitate the transition 
from one address component to another [6]. And it is a good

approach, but still needs transition information first. Some 
used rule based method to find address templates and it is 
proved to be useful [1]. Considering the diversity in Chinese 
addresses, the manual rule based method is time and energy 
consuming. 
So find a more practical way to construct address models 
is essential in Chinese geocoding. Here we use Boolean 
association rules to construct address models. 
III. PREPARING WORKS 
A. Classification Of Address Elements 
In foreign countries, an address record always contains 
some fixed address elements, including “door number”, 
“street name”, “street type”, “directions” and so on. 
Classification in address categories is simple and clear. 
However in china classification is an indispensable part 
before analyzing address structures. All the classification 
work in china is based on address keywords. 
Address keywords, also known as address suffix, like ‘?
?city?, ??county?, ??raod?, ??number?’, are 
the signs for the sort of address elements. Compared to the 
western countries, Chinese addressing systems are more 
complicated for the country’s long history and rich culture.  
In 2008 State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping released 
surveying and mapping industry standardization technical 
documents (CH/Z 9002-2007) [7]. According to this file, 
address elements are divided into 6 categories and some 
regulations are made in address expressions.  Because it did 
not consider the details, we should enrich it in our practice. 
Summarizing the address keywords in Nanjing and  
referencing the country’ s administrative division code (GB 
2260-1995), we classified the address elements into 10 
categories : RD (administrative divisions)(including 
RDPROV(province), RDCITY(city), RDDIST(district), 
RDCOUN(county), RDTOWN(town), 
RDCSID(countryside), RDVILL(village), RDGROU(group), 
RDTEAM(team)), PC(organizations and symbol buildings), 
LS(alleyway),LR(main road), RS(residential 
place),RJ(settlements),RZ(natural features), PH(buildings), 
PU(units), PD(door number). 
B. Dataset Parsing 
The parsing results are the fundamental data sets that 
address models are extracted from. Chinese addresses like 
many eastern language based addressing systems, do not 
have delimiters between words. This poses the work of 
segmentation. In theory, Chinese address resolution is similar 
to word segmentation in Chinese natural language processing. 
We used rule based parsing method [8] with the combination 
of machine learning method (e.g. conditional random fields) 
[9] to parse Chinese addresses.  
For example, the input address records are as follows: 
?????????? 5?(No.5 Hebin Park Xiongzhou Town Luhe 
District) 
????????? 108 ? (No.108 Chaotian Street Xiongzhou 
Town Luhe District) 
After the segmentation process, the outcomes are as 
follows: 
???/RDDIST ???/RDTOWN ????/RS 5?/PD (No.5/PD 
Hebin Park/RS Xiongzhou Town/RDTOWN Luhe District/RDDIST) 
???/RDCOUN ???/RDTOWN ???/LR 108?/PD 
(No.108/PD Chaotian Street/LR Xiongzhou Town/RDTOWN Luhe 
District/RDCOUN) 
Space splits addresses into address elements, the 
annotations after the character ’/’ represent the categories of 
address elements.  As shown above, the annotation “PD” 
stands for the door number part in addresses.  
After the parsing work, the address records are parsed 
into single address elements. These works provides data for 
model construction. 
C. Address templates 
When the addresses are successfully parsed, we get many 
annotated records. Following the traditional way, we get 
address templates from the vast address data sets using 
statistical methods?like city-town-street-door number in the 
example above.  
We get so many address templates, such as  
city –district –organization 
city –district –street–door number 
city –street –door number 
… 
The idea is proved to be right, but the results we get are 
not satisfying. First, the probability of each address templates 
is very low, there are no predominant address templates. 
What’s more, the quantity of the templates are numerous, if 
only one element in the template is different from the 
existing one then it will considered to be a new template. 
Third, the amount of the templates is very sensitive to the 
changes in address elements’ granularity. The smaller the 
address elements’ granularity the larger the amount of   
address templates would be.  
IV. ASSOCIATION RULES 
A.  Boolean Association Rules 
Association rule mining is a method that used to find 
frequent patterns, associations, correlations, or causal 
structures among sets of items or objects in transaction or 
relational databases, and other information repositories [10]. 
It can be defined into three categories: based on the types of 
values, based on the dimensions of data and based on the 
levels of abstraction [11]. Here we introduce the first 
category---Boolean association rule mining. 
Two important parameters in association rules: 
Support: s% ? T?? N????? ?? T????????????X?Y?T?? N????? ?? T????????????D?                     
(1) 
Confidence:c% ? ??? ?????? ?? ?????????????X?Y???? ?????? ?? ?????????????X?              (2) 
                                                                                                                                          2896
‘D’ stands for the total transactions. ‘X’
different properties. So ?s%?  represents the 
‘X?Y’ contains in ‘D’, while ?c%? represents 
probability that the transactions have ‘X’ also h
B. The Mining Process 
In ArcGis’ geocoding package, address 
divided into 32 categories, from “single fiel
Range” [12]. Followed this way, in some 
address geocoding applications, researchers

According to our work, address elements r

above the minimum, it can be extracted.

As shown above, the oval-shapes in the windows 
represent different address elements, the lines that connect 
different oval-shapes represent the relationship between 
address elements.  
The sequential information between address elements is 
showed as the lines connect different parts of oval-shapes: 
when the line is connected to the oval-shape’s bottom then 
the oval-shape is the previous address elements and when the 
line connected to the top of the oval-shape, the oval-shape is 
the next address element. 
Setting different minimum parameters (min-support and 
min-conf), we get different mining results. Association rule 
mining can help us get rid of redundant information in 
addresses, and extract the information we want. The larger 
the amount of the address records the greater help the 
association rules can bring. 
V. CONLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper we used the principle of association rules to 
construct Chinese address models and make the models in a 
visual form. It represents a new perspective to analyzing 
Chinese addresses--binary relationship between address 
elements. 
We currently used the Boolean association rule which is 
the simplest in three association rules. As the work 
developed we thought that dimensional association rules may 
be more suitable, because we have found the dimensional 
features in the address elements classification. So this would 
be our next effort. 
  Address models can make the complex address 
structures more clear and analyzable. As we extracted the 
useful models from the parsed address records, the next step 
is to put it into the geocoding practice: standardization, 
parsing and matching.
