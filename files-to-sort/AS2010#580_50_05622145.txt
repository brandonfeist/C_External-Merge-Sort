Abstract—Personalized recommendation is the process of 
customizing Web site to meet the requirement of specific user 
by analyzing user's browsing behavior and extracting 
knowledge based on Web logs. Association rules mining 
technology is widely adopted in this field. However, the 
resulting association patterns can not effectively predict user’s 
future browsing behavior because of the low similarity degree 
between resulting rules and user's browsing behavior. In this 
paper, we assign a weight to each item in a transaction to 
reflect the interest degree, which extends the traditional 
association rule method. We also proposed weighted 
association rule (WAR) through associating a weight with each 
item in resulting association rules. Each Web page is assigned 
to a weight according to interest degree and three key factors, 
i.e. visit frequency, stay duration and operation time. A novel 
personalized recommendation mechanism is presented based 
our proposed WAR. The weighted measurement in our 
personalized recommendation can be used to determine the 
importance of Web pages for user. We try to acquire user’s 
requirement more precisely so as to more useful Web pages are 
discovered and recommended for user.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In recent year?large amounts of information emerge on 
the Internet. It is convenient for users to retrieve information 
and discover knowledge. However, the dramatic growth and 
rapid expansion of Internet information often make Internet 
users suffer from the information overload problem. 
Personalization [1] is one of the promising methods to deal 
with this the problem. Users’ visit behaviors can be analyzed 
to extracted knowledge, which can make the content and 
structure of websites to adapt to users’ need. 
Recently, researches on Web mining greatly facilitate us 
to tackle this problem. Most of developed systems in this 
field are based on Web usage mining [2]. Many works are 
very concerned about Web usage mining [3], and it is 
considered as the most potential method to achieve 
personalization [1] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. The knowledge to 
describe users’ browsing behaviors is found out, which help 
system to personalize Web sites according to each user’s 
behaviors and characteristics of each individual site. Web 
usage mining applies common data mining technology to 
discovery usage patterns, forms Web data, and makes 
recommendations based on them. These systems are mainly 
focused on analyzing Web usage logs, finding out patterns 
from the data and making recommendations based the 
extracted knowledge [5] [7] [9]. The traditional 
recommender systems make decision mainly based on users’ 
clear feedbacks for different items [10] [11]. Unlike this, 
these technologies can discovery users’ preferences from 
their implicit feedbacks, such as Web pages they have visited. 
In this paper, we concern on the association-mining method 
in Web usage mining, which is widely used for data analysis 
[4] [6]. Association Rule (AR) mining has been successfully 
applied in Web page recommender systems and  Web site 
personalization, and it is easily to be extended to large data 
sets [7] [8] [11] [12]. However, the way to combine the 
weight of Web page with AR is never mentioned in previous 
studies about personalized recommender system.  
Weighted Association Rules mining can distribute 
different weights for different items to reflect their different 
importance [13], and it is a viable method of AR model in 
the process of improving personalization. Two methods are 
proposed to calculate weight of itemset: total weight and 
average weigh. Weighted support of an itemset is defined as 
product of the itemset support and itemset weight [11]. 
Itemset weight is defined as the average weight of the items 
in the set. Weighted support of an itemset is defined as the 
ratio of weight of the transactions containing the itemset 
relative to weight of all transactions. Both methods are 
sought to allocate the larger weight to the more important 
items, so as to discovery important but less frequency 
itemsets and associated rules. However, both methods 
assume a fixed weight for each item is assigned, while in 
Web usage mining and personalized recommender system 
environment, a Web page may have different importance in 
different sessions. 
In many works about recommendation based on 
Association rules and personalization, the time spent on each 
Web page has not been considered as an evaluation criterion 
for the importance of the Web page. In other words, all Web 
pages visited in user browsing mode are equally important 
for themselves, while ignoring the differences of Web page 
importance in another user session. Binary weight is used to 
extract matching active user with the rules in the basis of 
association rule [13]. Similarity measurement is combined 
with association rule [11]. Similarity between items is 
measured according to rules so as to make recommendation,

and then the most similar items are discovered for active 
users [8]. Duration is used to assign weight for each Web 
page, and significant itemset graph is adopted to improve the 
efficiency of recommendation [14]. 
Traditional association rules are extended in our work, 
each item is assigned a weight to reflect users’ interests 
about each item in the transactions. Then a new 
recommendation mechanism is put forward based on the 
proposed weighted association rule mining method. 
Operation times, visit frequency, stay duration (i.e. time 
spent on each Web page) are used to assign a quantitative 
weight to each Web page. Here, if a Web page is saved, 
printed, sent, edited and so on, we call it one time operation. 
This paper is organized as follows: in section 2, our 
weighting schema is presented. We give the weighted 
association rule in section 3. In section 4, we propose 
personalized recommendation mechanism. At last, we 
conclude our paper in section 5. 
II. WEIGHTING SCHEMA FOR WEB PAGE 
P={p1, p2, ..., pn} represent the set of Web pages visited 
by users and stored in Web server logs, and each Web page 
is identified by its associated URL. We also let T={t1, t2, ..., 
tm} denote the set of user transactions, where ti?T and ti?P. 
In order to achieve high-quality recommendation, an n-
dimensional vector over Web page space is used to indicate 
each transaction t, and t=<(p1, ?1), (p2, ?2), ..., (pn, ?n)>, 
where ?i represent the weight of Web page pi in transaction t. 
Here ?i also can reflect user’s interest in pi. 
As the recommendation is based on previous users’ 
behaviors, so the weight schema must be able to accurately 
model the user’s interest. However, the recommendation 
methods mentioned previously do not distinguish the 
importance of different Web pages. All visited Web page are 
treated equally regardless of whether it is useful to users or 
not. The difference of Web page importance is ignored and a 
page for each user session in the different degrees of interest. 
After all, user may have different interest in each Web page 
in a transaction. Sometimes user finds a Web page is of no 
value and has no interest in it only after entering into this 
Web page, which makes irrelevant Web pages to be recorded 
in the Web logs. Therefore, it is imperfect that all visited 
Web pages are used equally to obtain user’s interest and 
predict user’s behavior. Accordingly, a weight is expected to 
measure user’s interest to a Web page in usage-based 
recommender system. 
In this paper, we proposed a weighting schema, which 
obtains user’s interest of Web pages by calculating Web logs. 
In order to measure users’ interests more accurately and 
recommend more useful Web pages for users, three key 
factors, i.e. operation times, visit frequency and stay duration 
are used to estimate the importance of Web pages in a 
transaction. 
Visit frequency is the number of times that a Web page is 
visited by different users. Obviously, users have more 
interest in the Web page with a higher visit frequency. When 
we calculate visit frequency, the number of external links 
and internal links of a Web page should be considered. 
Clearly, a Web page with large number of external links and 
internal links has greater probability to be visited by users. 
Thus, we normalize visit frequency F(p) as follows: 
)()(
)()(
pLpL
pFpF
IE
total
+= .                                               (1) 
Where, Ftotal(p) represents user’s total visit times of a 
Web page p in a transaction. LE(p) and LI(p) are the number 
of external links and internal links of Web page p 
respectively. 
Stay duration is selected as one of the weighting 
parameters because it can reflect the relative importance of 
each Web page. In general, user may spend more time on 
more useful Web page. However, stay duration is often 
affected by the length of Web page. Therefore, we normalize 
stay duration according to the length of Web page, i.e. the 
total bytes of Web page. The formula of stay duration D(p) is 
given as follows: 
)(
)()(
pLength
pDpD total= .                                                     (2) 
Where, Dtotal(p) represents user’s real stay duration of a 
Web page p in a transaction. Length(p) is the total bytes of 
the Web page. D(p) denotes the normalized stay duration. 
Operation time of Web page O(p) is the third key factor 
to assign weight to each Web page. O(p) is the sum of user’s 
operation of a Web page. The possible operations include 
saving, editing, copying, adding to favorites, printing, and so 
on. So it can be obtained as follows: 
?
?
=
Pp
t pOpO )()( .                                                          (3) 
Where, Ot(p) is each user’s operation time of Web page 
p in transaction t. 
Accordingly, we assign a weight to each Web page in a 
transaction based on the above three factors as follows: 
)()()( pOpDpF ××=? .                                           (4) 
III. WEIGHTED ASSOCOATION RULE FOR 
RECOMMENDATION 
The traditional association rule is extended in this section. 
Each item in the transaction is assigned a weight to reflect 
user’s interest. In turn, this makes each item in a resulting 
association rule to association with a weight, which is called 
weighted association rule (WAR). 
By use of WAR in electronic commerce, the products 
with high profit margins should be paid more attention. 
WAR mining assigns different weights for different items, 
which can improve the performance of personalized 
recommendation. 
2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)
V12-109
A Web page in different sessions may have different 
importance. So in this paper, a greater weight is assigned to a 
more important Web page to facilitate us to find important 
itemsets and association rules but with lower visit frequency 
and operation times. 
First of all, Apriori [11] [12] is extended according to the 
weighted rules with association parameters described as 
follows. 
In a transaction t, the weight of an itemset ? can be 
denote as ?t(?), which can be obtained by use of the average 
weight of all items in itemset ?: 
k

Where k is the number of items in the itemset ?. 
In order to distinguishing the difference between 
different transactions, the transaction weight ?(t) is defined 
to calculate the support of each itemset. ?(t) can be obtained 
as follows: 
kt ???? ×××= ...)( 21 .                                          (6) 
Accordingly, weighted support of itemset appeared in all 
transaction can be calculated as follows: 
?

tS )()()( ????? .                                           (7) 
Now we define weighted confidence of weighted 
association rule C?(?): 
)(

YXSYXC
?
??
?=? .                                        (8) 
Therefore, the rule r in weighted association rule mining 
can be described as follows: 
r= <(b1, b2,…,bk), (hk+1, hk+2,…, hk+n), (?1, ?2,…,?k+n), , 
C?(?)> ?R 
And R is the set of all weighted association rules. 
IV. RECOMMENDATION MECHANISM 
A recommendation set can be calculated for active user 
session according to association rule mining. Sliding 
window [14] is adopted to control the number of Web pages 
which match with the association rules in the session. 
Therefore, it is very important to maintain a historical depth 
in recommender system. 
In previous works [7] [11] [13], a fixed size sliding 
window is used in the active user session to obtain the 
historical depth of current user and generate 
recommendations. 
The size of sliding window is n, and move clockwise 
over the active user session. Recommendation value is 
affected by only the last visited n Web pages. It is not 
appropriate to represent user’s current requirement of 
information by use of the earlier part of user session because 
most users go back and forth to find what they want when 
browsing a Website. However, the last visited n Web pages 
are treated equally in this method, which results in not 
distinguish the importance of Web pages for user. Therefore, 
only the Web pages what user is interested in are used to 
achieve personalized recommendation. 
Despite recently visited Web pages in active user session 
are more suitable for recommendation, but in many cases, 
user will have unexpected behaviors. Sometimes, user finds 
a very interesting one after browsing many Web pages, and 
spends much time on it. And then this process is repeated. 
Therefore, the weight and new degree of Web page should 
be taken into consideration simultaneously when 
personalized recommendation is made. 
In order to signify Web pages in active user session, the 
new degree of a Web page is defined as follows: 
)(
1)(
wsize
pN i = .                                                          (9) 
Where size(w) is the size of sliding window, and i is the 
location of Web page in the sliding window. 1 is assigned to 
the first visited Web page. Obviously, the last visited Web 
page has the largest new degree value. For the purpose of 
reflect the impact of new degree, weight of each Web page is 
normalized as follows: 
?
=
= n
j
j
i
i
1
*
?
?? .                                                                  (10) 
The higher user interest of a Web page, the larger the 
values of new degree and *i? . So the user interest degree of 
a Web page can be defined as follows: 
*
*
)(
)(2
ii
ii
i pN
pN
?
?? ×
××= .                                                   (11) 
Now an effective mechanism is given for personalized 
recommendation based on weighted association rules. 
Weighted association rules of each URL are extracted from 
Web logs, the generated rules express behavior 
characteristics of user’s browsing on Web site. Before we 
make recommendations, the n weighted association rules 
which are most similar to active user sessions are searched 
out by use of similarity degree. 
Each weighted association rule r (described as section 3) 
can be represented as a set of Web page-weight pairs. Thus, 
both weighted association rules and active user session are 
2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)
V12-110
treated as n-dimensional vectors over the Web page space in 
Web site. Left side of r is denoted as vector rL={?1, ?2,…,?n} 
if and only if pi?rL. 
The active user session is also denoted as a n-
dimensional vector: E={e1, e2,…,en}. And ei is a weight 
association with the corresponding web page. If user has 
visited pi in this user session, ?(ei)= *i? ; otherwise, ?(ei)=0. 
Accordingly, the similarity degree ? between active user 
session and weighted association rules which illustrate 
relationships among Web pages can be calculated as follows: 
?
= +
?=
n
i ii
ii
e
e
1 )(
))((2
??
??? .                                                 (12) 
In order to determine which items are to be 
recommended, we also calculate a recommendation degree ? 
for each Web page as follows: 
)(),( pXCpXE ?×=? ??? .                           (13) 
So the largest recommendation degree is chosen as the 
recommendation to the active user session. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we proposed a novel personalized 
recommendation mechanism based on weighted association 
rules (WAR) model. Each Web page is assigned to a weight 
to reflect its importance. The value of weight is decided by 
three key factors: visit frequency, stay duration and operation 
times. The Weighted association rules of each URL are 
extracted from Web logs of, and similarity degree of active 
user session is calculated according to WAR. Then most 
similar rules to the active user session with the highest 
weighted confidence are discovered. Finally, the largest 
recommendation degree is chosen as the recommendation to 
the active user session by evaluating each rule in terms of the 
similarity and weighted confidence. Our method will try to 
predict which Web pages are most likely to be visited by 
users, so it can improve the performance of personalized 
recommendation.
