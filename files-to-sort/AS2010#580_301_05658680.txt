Abstract-According to the shortcomings that data mining of 
the star schema structure is more complex, this paper planes a 
star schema structure, on base of these, an association rules 
mining algorithm is constructed. The algorithm first scans the 
fact table, produces maximum frequent set and association 
rules, and then the dimension table attributes are scanned 
quickly by link conditions and the local effectiveness principle 
of association rules, which of the dimension table is one-off 
production. The tacit knowledge is mined by constructing 
extended dimension table for the undefined association rules. 
The mining speed of the algorithm is faster and the extended 
hidden information can be found in this way.)

I. INSTRUCTION 
Data mining technology has obtained extensive research, 
application and development since its beginning, the 
research field is very extensive. But data mining is based on 
common table structure in data organizing form of research. 
The star schema is an organization form of database, and 
is composed of two kinds of the basic table: a fact table and 
dimension tables. The fact table includes practical 
transactions or the analysis values wanted, and dimension 
tables include the description information related to these 
transactions and values. The star schema exists widely in 
database application system [10-11]. 
The star schema mining belongs to multidimensional 
data mining, and mining algorithm is too complicated 
because data dimension is larger. The mining research 
according to multidimensional data is relatively less at 
present, and mostly adopts the layered structure mining, and 
the dimension table uses different threshold, which the 
casualness is greater and can not suit mining [1-41. 
In mining algorithm, FP _Tree and genetic algorithm etc 
are adopted mostly. However, the research for the classical 
Apriori algorithm is relatively less [5-9]. 
A new algorithm of association rules mining to the star 
schema structure is proposed in the paper, which does not 
need to go the consolidation of table and go directly and 
efficiently data mining in the star schema. Basis for the local 
principle, the fact table and dimension tables can use the 
same threshold to mine. Association rules of the fact table 
are produced, the dimension tables can be quickly produced,

and can go the discovery of tacit knowledge by using 
heuristic method .. 
II. THE STAR SCHEMA CONSTRUCTION 
In order to go reasonably data mining, suggestions are as 
follows according to the star schema construction. The 
information included in the fact table should be enough, so 
ensuring the basic rules production. The dimension table 
represents the information description in a certain field of 
transaction. The fact table and the dimension table link 
through the primary key and foreign keys.

Figure I. The structure diagram of the star schema 
In figure, ( PI '  FI ) ( P2, F2) 
(P3, F3) and (P4, F4) link through the primary key and 
foreign keys, and form the star schema. 
Defined 1 The fact table is expressed as follows in the 
star schema structure: Tm (PI ... Pn, RI, ... , Rm), and the 
maximum frequent set of Tm is expressed as: (PI ... Pn, 
MFIj) , in which Pi (i= 1, 2, ... ,n) is the ith key word of the 
primary key of the fact table, and MFIj is the jth maximum 
frequent set of the fact table. The dimension table T si is 
expressed as: Tsi ( F i,R. I , ... ,R.k) , and the attribute is 
expressed as: (Fi, Rj) , in where i is the jth attribute of the 
ith dimension table, and Fi corresponds to Pi of the fact table 
is foreign key of the ith dimension table. 
III. ALGORITHM OF ASSOCIATION RULES MINING 
Theorem 1 If the fact table exists the maximum frequent 
set (PI ... Pn, MFIj ) , and the association rule A-+B is 
introduced, the frequency that the attribute Rj of the ith 
dimension table occured in the tuple Pi is equal to Fi in the 
dimension table and it is more than the minimum support 
Support, then the association rules A B-+Rj does exist. 
Proved: The fact table exists the maximum frequent set 
(PI ... Pn, MFIj), and the association rule A---+B is introduced, 
then A C MFIj, Be MFIj, AnB=<l> and Rj ct. MFIj 
According to the connection table T m 1><1 Tsj (link: condition 
is Pj= Fj) , the support of MFIj is 100%, and the support of 
Rj is more than minimum support Support, so the support of 
MFIjRj is more than Support, MFIjRj is the maximum 
frequent set. 
support { MFIj ,RJ) = support {MFIjRJ) = support = 1 ? support 
support { Rj } support { Rj } support 
The confidence level of MFIjRj is 1, therefore, the 
association rule A B---+Rj is tenable, and theorem 1 is tenable. 
Theorem 2 The local association rules produced by 
theorem are effective. 
Proved: the proportion of a given population is [p%, q%] 
(it only is an estimation, the population does not always be 
certain beforehand) in a certain transaction database. The 
minimum support of frequent set is defined as c%, the range 
of segmentation support is [p%*c%, q%*c%]. The 
frequencies of k-set are in the range of [p%*c%, q%*c%], so 
the minimum support should be similar to the selection 
principle of Apriori algorithm. 
c (A? B)= s(AUB) = s(AUB)x c% 
s(A) s(A)x c% 
Therefore, the rules produced by theorem 1 are effective. 
IV. THE TACIT KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY 
When the association rules produced by current mining 
database are not detailed enough mining, the extended 
dimension can be further constructed and mined, and the 
tacit knowledge is produced. 
The fact table is added into the key word Pk, and 
increases an extended dimension (Fh RJ, R2, ••• ,Rn), and a 
link condition is constructed by using Pk and Fk• Data mining 
can be carried out by using the theory of theorem 1, and the 
tacit knowledge is obtained. 
V. ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION 
a) scans the fact table, and produces the association rule 
Scans the fact table, finds the maximum set (PI ... Pn, 
MFIj), and produces the association rule A---+B. 
b) scans the dimension table 
Scans all the dimension tables. 
According to the link condition Pj= Fi, the ith dimension 
table is scanned, and the occurrence number tj of the attribute 
Rj is counted. if tj ? Support then the association rule AB---+ Rj 
is obtained. 
The algorithm is realized based on the classical Apriori, 
the detailed description is omitted here.

VI. EXPERIMENTS 
The fact table is mined locally according to the theorem 
2.2, parts of achievements of 63 students which comes from 
the 2003th undergraduates of Computer Science in Inner 
Mongolia university for nationalities are mined, and the 
selection fields are (student number, mathematics, 
specialized course, English, sports, moral education, 
tendency). 
The record distribution of tendency (postgraduate) and 
the scores of specialized course(good) is shown in Table I. 
The result of the table has shown that the local population of 
"tendency (postgraduate)" exists the rule: "tendency 
(postgraduate)" ---+the scores of specialized course(good), 
because the support of data set< tendency (postgraduate) and 
the scores of specialized course(good» in local population is 
min{86%, 100%,}=86%.

the confidence level of selection is 80%. 
The mining result is shown in Figure5-1, which produced 
seven frequent sets, five the maximum frequent sets and an

Figure 2. The mining result of the fact table 
The maximum frequent sets (B1F1) occur six times. 
During the tacit knowledge mining, the primary key of 
the fact table is "student number" and fields of the fact table 
are as follows: 
(student number, Mathematics, specialized course, 
English, Sports, Moral education, tendency) 
Constructing the dimension table of "student's 
information", the fields are as follows: 
(student number, name, sex, age, region) 
Equality of "student number" is used as the link 
condition, and the dimension table of "student's 
information" has five record of "sex=female", as shown in 
Table II.

Applying the algorithm description of theorem 1, it can 
be obtained the association rule as follows:

course(good» --+<sex(female » 
VII. CONCLUSION 
According to the shortcomings that data mining of the 
star schema structure is more complex, the star schema 
structure is constructed basis on the algorithm features. 
Basing on these, an association rules mining algorithm is 
constructed, which can go the global and local data mining 
for database tables. The rapid mining algorithm is given for 
dimension tables of the star schema, and the tacit knowledge 
is mined by constructing extended dimension tables for the 
undefined association rules. 
Tested by experiments, the algorithm is practical 
and effective.
