Abstract?Data mining basing on Privacy preservation 
has become a research hot point now. Web usage 
mining is one kind of data mining applications, and how 
to prevent data leakiness in web usage mining is also an 
important issue. In this paper, we present an effective 
method for privacy preserving association rule mining 
in the web usage mining, Secondary Random Response 
Column Replacement (SRRCR) to improve the privacy 
preservation and mining accuracy. Then, a privacy 
preserving association rule mining algorithm based on 
SRRCR is presented, which can achieve significant 
improvements in terms of privacy and efficiency. 
Finally, we present experimental results that validate 
the algorithms by applying it on real datasets. 
Keywords: web usage mining; privacy preservation; 
randomized response; association rules 
I. INTRODUCTION 
With the continuous development of data mining 
technology, its appliance is more and more widely. 
Web data mining is an application hot point of data 
mining in recent years. The fast development of 
web makes itself to be the world's largest public 
data source, Web data mining is based on public 
data sources, but there are also privacy leakiness 
problem. For example, on e-commerce site, all 
records of customers visited the website are stored 
in Web server log without reservation. These 
records reflect the consumers‘ buying habits and 
purchasing powers?but the customers do not want 
these data to be disclosed, so privacy protection 
should also be considered in the web data mining. 
Privacy preserving association rule mining is to 
discover the frequent itemsets as accurately as 
possible and generate the minimum support and 
confidence by accessing the original transaction 
sets of conditions. There is a contradiction between 
data privacy and data accuracy. At present, the 
privacy protection of data mining methods can be 
divided into data perturbation [1-3] and query 
restriction [4-5]. In 2002, S. J. Rizvi and J. R. 
Haritsa presented a representative association rules 
mining method, MASK (Mining Associations with 
Secrecy Konstraints) [1] that is a data perturbation 
strategies. Because Warner model in statistics is 
used in MASK, all the data transformed have the 
directly relations with the real raw data, which 
makes the preserving less than satisfactory, and the 
selection of randomized parameters should deviate 
from 0.5 [6] is another limitation.  
In this paper, we give the general framework for 
mining association rules in the web usage mining 
and use a user-oriented and time-oriented session 
explore method to generate sequence sets firstly. 
Then we propose a method to transform user 
session information into a relational data table, and 
perturb data by using Secondary Random Response 
Column Replacement (SRRCR) algorithm. Based 
on the pseudorandom data set, frequent itemsets 
and strong association rules discovery algorithm 
are presented.  
II. THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK  
As e-commerce, Web services and Web-based 
information system‘s sustainable development and 
growth, there are a large number of user data 
collected in web organizations. The principal data 
sources in web usage mining are web server log 
files, and other Data sources including the web site 
files and metadata, operational databases, 
application templates and domain knowledge. In 
order to solve privacy preservation issues of web 
usage mining, we proposed Secondary Random 
Response Column Replacement (SRRCR) 
algorithm, and a privacy protection association rule 
mining methods based on it. The overall structure 
and framework shown as follow Fig.1.The 
frameworks were divided into 2 stages: data 
preprocessing stage and privacy preserving 
&mining stage. The data preprocessing stage 
preprocessing the data by five steps and generate 
the session translate table. The privacy preserving 
stage is the key stage including the privacy 
preservation methods and association rule 
application.

III.  PRIVACY PRESERVATION IN WEB 
APPLICATIONS MINING  
A. Data Preparation 
Each click action of web user in e-commerce 
sites is recorded in the web log, so the original web 
log records contain a lot of browsing information. 
Before web data mining, data should be 
preprocessed [8], where the process includes 
filtering, despidering, user identification, 
sessionization and path completion. 
B. Time-oriented user session exploring 
method 
After data preprocessing, we can mine and 
extract relevant data in web server logs. For the 
purposes of analysis, these data need to be 
converted and aggregated in the  different levels. In 
web usage mining, the page is the basic level of 
data extraction and the session is the basic action in 
the data extraction for users.

Table1 shows a sample of user’s original session. 
In the table each row represents a user session 
identified by using uniquely ID , and IP represents 
the user's IP address, where different addresses for 
different users. URL means the page accessed by 
users in the session. The ideal method of user path 
restoring can reconstruct the real process of user 
session. Here we use time-oriented user sessions 
explore method. 
Let the vector M?M1?M2?…?Mi?…?
MN?represent the log data set, where Mi=?IPi?
URLi?Datei?Timei, Methodi, Codei, Bytesi? , 
and N is the number of log files. Web logs contain 
the IP addresses, visited URLs, date and time 
records, access methods (GET or POST), access 
structure and the size of access information. the 
vector S?S1?S2?…?Si?…?SK? represents 
the session data set, where k is the number of 
sessions, and Si=?IPi?Pagei?ti?,this structure 
contains the IP address , visited page and the 
timestamp in each session. Pagei=?Page 1?Page 2
?…?Page i?…?Page L?, L is the number of 
pages for the session. 
The algorithm 1 is described below: 
For each Mi of M 
If Methodi is ‘GET’ and Urli is 
‘WEBPAGE’ 
    If ?Sk?  S and IPk=IPi  
Set t0                                               // set the first time 
stamp of request in the session 
      If( ti –t0=<20min)           // set the limitation 
of access time is 20 minutes 
Sk=(IPk?PAGESk U PAGESi?tk) 
      else  
                Delete Sk from S 
Add Sk into S 
Endif

C. Transforming user sessions set into two-
dimensional relation table 
For the user session set in Table 2, we can use 
relations table S_table to store the user session path, 
the table structure is (TID, IPID, SESSIONID, Pi), 
Endif 
34
where we store the IP address, session ID, and the 
visits of each page in a two-dimensional table. The 
value of Pi column means whether the user visits 
the page and buys the products or not .in the column 
1 means an access to the page and 0 means no 
access to the page. 
The algorithm 2 is described below; it transfers 
the user activity records into the relation two-
dimensional table that can be handled easy. 
Algorithm 2 
Input: user session set S 
Output:  two-dimensional user session table 
S_table 
Create table S_table?TID,IP,SESSIONID,Pi? 
For each  Si  of  S  
Insert into S_table(IPID,SID) values (IPi,SIDi) 
If  ?Pi  of  Si 
       Insert into S_table?Pi?Values(‘1’); 
else  
       Insert into S_table?Pi?Values(‘0’); 
 Endfor 
Each session will be seen as a transaction, the 
customer's session sequence can be converted to 
relational tables where the page numbers represent 
the corresponding purchase action. We added a new 
field TID in the table 3, which is the identity 
column and can be assigned values automatically by 
the system.

10004 9.6.7.8 4 0 1 1 1 0 
10005 5.6.7.9 5 1 1 0 1 1 
D.  Privacy Protection Algorithm 
In the two-dimensional table the columns which 
need to privacy protected are P1, P2 and P3, P4 and 
P5, those columns are known as sensitive attributes 
in the privacy protection technology [7].The 
attribute values itself are not to disclose privacy, but 
the attribute group will leak customers privacy 
information. Therefore we protect the sensitive 
attributes by using the improved randomized 
response method. In order to improve the efficiency 
of data preservation, we randomize the value twice 
at a certain probability, and this algorithm is named 
the secondary random response column replacement 
algorithm (SRRCR). Specific methods are as 
follows: 
Set random parameter I,  
1,,,0 4321 ?? pppp ,and 14321 =+++ pppp , 
Set random parameter II,  
1r,r,r,r0 4321 ?? ,and 1rrrr 4321 =+++ ? 
Create randomization function R (x), the original 
column C (i, j) is transformed to hiding column F (i, 
j), where F(i,j)?{0,1},C(i,j)?{0,1}. 
For x= F(i,j) ?{0,1}, random function convention 
is  as follows: 
TABLE4 CONVENTION OF RANDOM FUNCTION 
 p1 p2 p3 P4 
x   x   0   1 y 
 r1 r2 r3 r4 
y x 0 1 null 
Let i is an item , where ? is the support of i in C, 
?null is the support of null in C, ? is the support of i 
in F.  The transaction T of C is converted by 
SRRCR process to the transaction T? of F, and then 
there is: 
44null r*p=?                       (1)

algorithm is the introduction of the adjustable 
factors to calculate of the support. In t the actual 
perturbation process, we can use a null value to 
further enhance privacy preservation. 
TABLE 5 PROBABILITIES OF DATA MAPPING BY SRRCR METHOD 
Assuming that support threshold is 0.4 in the M, 
and choosing p1 =0.2,p2=0.2,p3=0.1,p4=0.5, while

SRRCR algorithm customer session set is converted

After conversion algorithm SRRCR, fake sets 
include not only the value of 0 and 1, also null 
value. The meaning of Null can be defined by the 
user. 
Mining association rules can take into account 
the column of null value and  the support of itemset 
i in fake set after converted from SRRCR algorithm 
can matches the support of j in the original 
transaction set. 
IV. PRIVACY PRESERVING ASSOCIATION 
RULE MINING ALGORITHM 
Apriori algorithm is an influential algorithm for 
mining frequent itemsets and Boolean association 
rules. Based on the Apriori Algorithm [9], we 
presented an improved algorithm to achieve 
association rule mining for fake transaction sets 
converted by SRRCR. Given the minsup and data 
set, main implementation actions of the algorithm 
are described as follows: 
Algorithm 4. Progressive scan association rule 
mining algorithm. 
1. Setting frequent itemsets ? , and ? is 
collection of  itemset Mn whose item number is 
n?where n=?
=
k
1i
i
kC ?and k is the maximum 
number transactions. 
2. Searching the largest itemset progressively. 
Algorithms scan the data row by row, and matching 
each line with all items set, if the row matches with 
some itemsets, then plus 1 for each location of 
sequence? . 
3. Using Apriori pruning  principle in the process of 
match the itemset in the row data. Algorithm first 
match 1-itemset, then 2- itemset, 3-itemset ….to 
reduces the computer load. 
4. Circulation in turn?when the ratio of the number 
in k- itemset of the searched rows to the numbers of 
all rows has reached the minimum support of k- 
itemset, stop this k-itemset match process .If  the 
ratio o f the number n in k- itemset of the searched 
rows to the numbers of all rows m has not reached 
the minimum support of k- itemset, only reached 
the number of x , when n/m> minsup , algorithm 
calculate r=((n-m)+x)/m, if r> minsup, continues 
circulating, else stop this itemset search. 
5. Getting all the frequent itemsets which satisfy the 
minsup. 
Processing of Algorithm is described below : 
Input: itemset D? after conversion algorithm 
SRRCR, minimum support threshold s. 
Output: frequent itemset F of real dataset D. 
Set? , 
? ={M1,M2,…,Mn} = {(L1),(L2),..(Lk), (L1,L2),.. 
(L1...Lk)} is the full itemset  
for (i=n; i>0?i--)  ,and n=?
=
k
1i
i
kC   
set Ai=index(i)  // set the searching matrix 
matching? (i) 
for each transaction t?D?  // scan each row  
   Ri= Ci *Ai 
    if  ?Ri ? 0, then // exit matched row 
       if i=n  //counting every item calculate template  
?c.count= c.count0+1 , c.count1= c.count1+1…. 
c.countn= c.countn+1? 
      else  
 select_add( c.count) // function select_add 
      endif 
  endif 
endfor 
Fk ?? supmin/. ??? ncountcCc k  
endfor 
return Fk kk FU?  
Function select_add is to count each itemset after 
pruning (ki) , that is c.count= c.count0+1 , c.count1= 
c.count1+1…. c.countn= c.countn+1. In the counting 
process, algorithm prune the frequent itemsets 
generated (Pruning methods is in Apriori principle, 
no explanation). 
After obtained frequent itemsets, based on the 
support and confidence formula below, data 
providers can find the assoication rules of web log 
item. 
Support (A ? B) = Support_count (AUB) /  
all_count 
V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
A. Algorithm Complexity Analysis 
Theoretically, Apriori algorithm is an exponential 
algorithm. let N be the size of transaction, each 
transaction includes n items averagely, and then the 
whole itemset space will reach ? ? 2n? .The 
mining algorithm we have improved, when k <1-2 * 
(1-minsup), the itemset corresponds with the 
position of the value in sequence ? does not match 
the minimum support, the last calculations for this 
itemset will be given up. If we do not consider this 
kind of row optimization, time complexity of the 
algorithm is  
36
??N* ?
=
n/2
1i
i
nC ?=??N*2n/2?. 
 If the probability pre-judgment mentioned above 
is taken into account during the row judge, the 
complexity will decrease continually. 
B.  Experimental results 
We obtained  the web server log files in some 
C2C website in 30 days and converted transaction 
sets T by the algorithm 1and 2. The transact number 
is 1000, the item number is 11, and the ATL (the 
average transaction length) is 2.8. We analyzed the 
privacy protection with minimum support of 3%, 
and the following table shows the privacy 
protection intensity of the minimum support of 3% 
with different values of randomized algorithm 
parameters for different.  
TABLE 7 INTENSITY OF PRIVACY PROTECTION 
  
The Fig.2 shows the average itemset error of 
SRRCR method and MASK method, and states the 
relationships between the random parameter, the 
data privacy intensity and the accuracy of mining 
results. 
 
Fig. 2 Average itemsets error of SRRCR method and MASK 
method 
As can be seen, MASK method has wide error by 
comparison. When the P is close to 0 or 1, the 
mining results is more accurate, but the intensity of 
privacy protection is poor. When the value of P 
gradually approaches 0.5, privacy protection 
intensity has been improved, but the accuracy of 
mining results will be significantly decreased. Error 
changes of the method SRRCR proposed in this 
paper is relatively stable, according to the P value, 
that is, when the proportion of real data vary from 0 
to 1, the privacy damage coefficient will increased 
from 0 to 1 simultaneously, so it lead to the 
decrease of the intensity of privacy protection, and 
continuously improve the accuracy of mining 
results. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Privacy preserving in web data mining has arisen 
worldwide concerns with the promotion of network 
technology and the demand of application. But 
there are many drawbacks and open questions. 
In this paper, we have presented a method for 
privacy preserving mining of association rules 
based on web usage mining. First, we gave the 
general framework for mining association rules in 
the web usage mining, generated session sets by 
exploring user sessions and transfer session sets to 
relation two-dimension table. Second, we proposed 
secondary random response column replacement 
(SRRCR), a simple and effective privacy preserving 
algorithm, and achieve privacy protection 
association rule mining based on SRRCR. Finally, 
we presented experimental results that validated the 
algorithm (SRRCR) in practice by simulation. 
In the future, we will enhance the efficiency of 
mining algorithm further by parallelization and 
other methods, and combine SRRCR with other 
privacy preserving ways to achieve more significant 
improvements in terms of privacy, accuracy, 
efficiency, and applicability.
