Abstract—Microarray data analysis is a very popular topic of 
current studies in bioinformatics. Most of the existing methods 
are focused on clustering-related approaches. However, the 
relations of genes cannot be generated by clustering mining. 
Some studies explored association rule mining on microarray,
but there is no concrete framework proposed on three-
dimensional gene-sample-time microarray datasets yet. In this 
paper, we proposed a temporal dependency association rule 
mining method named 3D-TDAR-Mine for three-dimensional 
analyzing microarray datasets. The mined rules can represent 
the regulated-relations between genes. Through experimental 
evaluation, our proposed method can discover the meaningful 
temporal dependent association rules that are really useful for 
biologists.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, microarray technology has become an 
important tool to elucidate many genes simultaneously, and 
data mining is a popular technology used for microarray 
analysis to elucidate gene expression information efficiently. 
Moreover, a new microarray technology can observe a set of 
genes under a set of samples during a series of time points. 
This kind of data is called gene-sample-time, three 
dimensional or 3D microarray datasets.
Most of the 3D microarray data analyses are focused on 
clustering. However, the regulation mechanism between 
genes cannot be generated by clustering mining. 
Nevertheless, to discover the relations between genes can 
depend on association rule mining. Although, some studies 
apply association rule mining [3], but there has no a concrete 
framework proposed on 3D microarray datasets yet. 
Therefore, we proposed a method named 3D-TDAR-Mine to 
discover the Temporal Dependency Association Rules on 3D 
microarray datasets. Represent the regulated-relations 
between genes.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, we give a problem definition about our research. 
The proposed method is detailed in Section 3. Section 4 
gives the experimental evaluation, and the concluding 
remarks are made in Section 5.
II. PROBLEM DEFINITION
A. Frequently Coherent Pattern
The purpose of this research is use 3D-TDAR-Mine to 
discover the Temporal Dependency between gene 
expressions reaction. We define the Frequently Coherent 
Pattern as reaction in this paper. Indicate as the Figure 1, 
gene expressions of Pho5 in the time points T6 to T9 are rise 
coherently in the samples S4 to S7.
Figure 1. Temporal dependency between Frequently Coherent Patterns.
Hence, Coherent Pattern is focus on one gene in one 
continuous time segment to compute the similarity of gene 
expression value between any two samples. If similarity 
value between two samples series are large than Coherence 
Threshold that user defined. Then, we can define these two 
samples series in this time segment as Coherent Pattern for 
this gene. For example, we defined the gene expression 
series S3 and S3 from T1 to T4 of gene Pho4 is Coherent 
Pattern if this two series satisfy the Coherence Threshold. 
Besides, we define two sample series as Support Sample 
if the two sample series are a Coherent Pattern in a sample 
set in this time segment. Therefore, all sample series in the 
Support Sample are similar. Moreover, in the cause of 
discover meaningful Coherent Pattern, the ratio of Support 
Sample in all samples must large than Minimum Support 
Threshold that user defined. And the ratio of Support Sample 
in all samples we named Support Sample Ratio.
Furthermore, the time length between the times points in 
each microarray data probably different. User can define the 
???978-1-4244-7640-4/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE
Pattern Minimum Length Threshold to restrict the 
meaningful minimum continual time point number of a 
Coherent Pattern. If a Coherent Pattern satisfies all of above 
thresholds, then we can define it as a Frequently Coherent 
Pattern and a reaction.
B. Temporal Dependency
In our research, we use the Temporal Dependency 
between Frequently Coherent Pattern from Tatavarty [6]. 
Table 1 show the definition about Temporal Dependency 
between Frequently Coherent Patterns. X and Y are the 
leading and following Frequently Coherent Pattern. Xs and 
Xe are the beginning and end time point of X. Besides, Ys 
and Ye are the beginning and end time point of Y. And use a 
user defines Time-delay Threshold to constraint the 
Frequently Coherent Patterns possible regulation time.

C. Proposed TS3 Similarity Measurement
In this paper, we define the Frequently Coherent Pattern 
as gene expressions reaction. Furthermore, Coherent Pattern 
is focus on one gene in one continuous time segment to 
compute the gene expression value similarity between any 
two samples. Hence, user can depend on their required 
feature of Coherent Pattern to choice the similarity measure 
method. If user wants to discover the Coherent Pattern 
between two samples that have identical shape in gene 
expression value series. They can use the PCC (Pearson 
correlation coefficient). But, in the real life reaction, it not 
always has identical shape. The expression value series 
between samples also have Shifting, Scale and Trend relation. 
Therefore, we proposed the TS3 similarity measurement to 
estimate the Coherent Pattern that considers the Shifting, 
Scale and Trend factors. 
To take a example, we have two gene expression series 
Si={si1, si2, ..., sin} and Sj={sj1, sj2, ..., sjn}. Besides, Si_max and 
Si_min is the maximum and minimum value in Si respectively. 
Furthermore, Sj_max and Sj_min is the maximum and minimum 
value in Sj respectively. Moreover, S’i and S’j is the slope 
series after Min-max normalization from Si and Sj. Therefore, 
S’i={ (si2 - si1) / (Si_max - Si_min), (si3 - si2) / (Si_max - Si_min), ..., 
(sin - si(n-1)) / (Si_max - Si_min) }={ s’i1, s’i2, ..., s’i(n-1) } and 
S’j={ (sj2 - sj1) / (Sj_max - Sj_min), (sj3 - sj2) / (Sj_max - Sj_min), ..., 
(sjn - sj(n-1)) / (Sj_max-Sj_min) }={s’j1, s’j2, ..., s’j(n-1)}. Each 
element in S’i and S’j was normalizing the ranges of value 
between 0 and 1. Besides, S’D is the difference series that 
from S’i and S’j. Then, The difference series S’D={s’i1 - s’j1,
s’i2 - s’j2, ..., s’i(n-1) - s’j(n-1)}. Further, Ri is the rank series 
from S’i. And Rj is the rank series from S’j. From minimum 
value to maximum value in one series is assign as 1 to n-1 in 
the rank series. The rank series such as Ri={ri1, ri2, ..., ri(n-1)}
and Rj={rj1, rj2, ..., rj(n-1)}, respectively. RD is a rank 
difference series that from Ri and Rj, to compare the rank 
difference between these two series. Such as RD={ |ri1 - rj1| + 
1, |ri2 - rj2| + 1, ..., |ri(n-1) - rj(n-1)| + 1 }={ rd1, rd2, ..., rd(n-1) }. 
Each element in RD is adding 1 as the base value. And |RD|=| 
rd1 + rd2, …, + rd(n-1) |.
The main ideal of TS3 is use Min-max normalization to 
normalize each series in the same range to handle the 
Shifting and Scale factor. And use rank difference series RD
to be the weight of Trend to estimate the similarity between 
two series. As the function (1), TS3 computes the S’Dk in the 
absolute value symbol, to estimate the difference value of 
expression. The range of |S’Dk| is between 0 and 2. Then, use 
rd1 as the weight in Trend difference. If the elements S’ik and 
S’jk have rank difference rdk, then the difference S’Dk will be 
enlarge as the weight rdk. After sum up the weighted value, it 
use 2×|RD| to normalize the value between 0 and 1. After all 
of above stage, we get the dissimilarity between Si and Sj. In 
the last stage, Subtract dissimilarity from 1 and get the TS3
similarity.

III. PROPOSED METHOD
In this research, we proposed the 3D-TDAR-Mine to 
discover the Temporal Dependency Association Rules in 3D 
microarray datasets. Figure 2 is the flow chart of our method;
it can divide into two phases. First, the Coherent Pattern 
Phase discovers the Frequently Coherent Pattern for each 
gene from the 3D gene expression data. We define the 
Frequently Coherent Pattern as reaction in this paper. The 
second phase discovers the Temporal Dependency 
Association Rules rely on the Frequently Coherent Pattern. 
We define the Temporal Dependency Association Rules as 
the reaction relationship between genes. Detailed 
illustrations of the method are given below.
Figure 2. 3D-TDAR-Mine algorithm flow chart
A. Finding Coherent Patterns
The purpose of finding Coherent Patterns stage is aim to 
discover the Frequently Coherent Pattern for each gene. And 
???
Frequently Coherent Patterns is focus on one gene in one 
continuous time segment have similar expression value in 
enough samples.
Suppose the method discover the 3D microarray dataset 
that has 3 genes, 7 samples and 9 time points. We named 
these 3 genes as G1, G2 and G3. And we named these 7 
samples as S1 to S7, sequentially. Then, we named these 9 
time points as T1 to T9. And the user defined Pattern 
Minimum Length Threshold is assuming as 4 time points 
length. Figure 3 is the flow chart of discover Frequently 
Coherent Patterns. In the first step, the method discovers the 
Frequently Coherent Patterns in the Sample-Time microarray 
of G1. In the beginning, time window cover time points T1 
to T4. Then, the method estimates the Coherent Patterns 
similarity between each two samples under window. In the 
second step, the method annotates the similarity between 
each two samples in the Coherent Score Matrix. In the third 
step, estimates the similarity in the Coherent Score Matrix. 
The sample similarity of Coherent Pattern must large than 
user define threshold.  If satisfy the threshold then annotate 1 
in the Boolean Similarity Matrix. Otherwise, annotate 0. In 
the fourth step, the method discovers the Frequently 
Coherent Patterns from the Boolean Similarity Matrix. The 
Support Sample Ratio for a Frequently Coherent Pattern 
must large than Minimum Support Threshold that user 
defined.
Figure 3. Flow chart of discover Frequently Coherent Patterns 
After these four steps, the method sliding the window 
begins from T2. Then repeat these four steps to discover the 
Frequently Coherent Patterns, until the window contains T9. 
After all of these steps, the Frequently Coherent Pattern of 
G1 has been discovered. Then the method repeat the steps 
like G1 to discovers the Frequently Coherent Pattern for 
other genes, respectively.
B. Merging Coherent Patterns
Different gene reaction maybe has different time length 
in the real life. Use a fixed Pattern Minimum Length 
Threshold for each gene will cute a complete reaction into 
many sub reactions. Therefore, in this stage, the method will 
try to merge the Frequently Coherent Patterns in the adjacent 
window for the same gene. Then, the method will estimate 
the common Support Sample Ratio. If the ratio still satisfies 
the Minimum Support Threshold then merge these two 
patterns as a longer one. The method will repeat the merge 
procedure, until check all of the Frequently Coherent 
Patterns in the adjacent window for the same gene. After 
merge pattern stage, each sub patterns will be deleting when 
merge be the longer Frequently Coherent Pattern.
C. Producing Candidate Rules
In the real life, each gene reaction will regulate other 
gene reaction in the finite time length. Therefore, any two 
Frequently Coherent Patterns have regulation mechanism 
will not separate in a long time range. For this purpose, the 
method discovers candidate rules that have Temporal 
Dependency.
On the purpose of discover Temporal Dependency 
between Frequently Coherent Patterns. In the first step, the 
method sort the patterns depend on their beginning time 
point. Figure 4 show the diagram for the Frequently 
Coherent Patterns after sorting. In the second step, the 
method producing the candidate rules that perhaps have 
Temporal Dependency between two Frequently Coherent 
Patterns. On the purpose of avoid producing the candidate 
rules that impossible have Temporal Dependency. The 
method restricts the adjacent beginning times point lengths 
between the patterns in the candidate rule. The adjacent 
beginning times point lengths cannot longer than leading 
pattern length adds the user defined Time-delay Threshold. 
Figure 4 show the candidate pattern in the restrict time point 
length with dotted line window for the leading pattern G1_1. 
In the third step, the method estimate the Temporal 
Dependency between the patterns in the restrict time point 
length. The process discovers the candidate rules from the 
first time point to the last time point; Table 2 shows the 
producing result of candidate rules.

D. Temporal Dependency Examination
The first step in this stage, the method estimates the 
common Support Sample Ratio from the candidate rules that 
producing in the producing candidate rules stage. The 
candidate rule must large than Minimum Support Threshold 
that to represent the patterns in this rule is in the same 
regulation mechanism. In the second step, the method will 
estimate Confidence in the candidate rule. The ratio of 
following pattern Support Samples in the leading pattern 
Support Samples named Confidence for this candidate rule. 
The Confidence large than the user defined Minimum 
Confidence Threshold represent that have enough dependent 
relation between these two patterns. The candidate rules 
satisfy above two thresholds will enter the third step to 
estimate the Temporal Dependency. The candidate rule 
satisfies one of the Temporal Dependencies that will be 
named as Temporal Dependency Association Rule. The rule 
also named as Temporal Dependency Association Rule with 
2-Length.
Table 2 shows the Support and Confidence of candidate 
rules. Supposed user defines Minimum Support Threshold as 
0.5 and Minimum Confidence Threshold as 0.8 in this 
example. If satisfy these two thresholds, then will to estimate 
the Temporal Dependency. Figure 5 shows the estimative 
result of Temporal Dependency Association Rule with 2-
Length.
Figure 5. Diagram for the rule with 2-length
After these steps, the method will merge the Temporal 
Dependency Association Rule with longer length when the 
longer rule still satisfies these thresholds. The stage will 
terminate when the method can not to merge Temporal 
Dependency Association Rule longer. Figure 6 shows the 
estimative result that longer than 2-length in this example.
Figure 6. Diagram for the estimative result that longer than 2-length. 
After producing one rule, the method will delete the rule 
that contain in other longer rules. The process will avoid to 
producing redundant rule with the same regulation 
mechanism. Therefore, the rule G1_2 Overlap G3_1 is the 
sub rules in the rule G1_2 Overlaps G3_1 Overlaps G2_2. 
And the rule G3_1 Overlaps G2_2 is the sub rules in the rule 
G1_2 Overlaps G3_1 Overlaps G2_2. The redundant rules 
will be deleting. Table 3 shows the final result of this 
example.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
Our experimental evaluation on real life datasets will 
demonstrate that the proposed 3D-TDAR-Mine to discover 
the Temporal Dependency Association Rules. And to prove 
the rules really have Temporal Dependency and biological 
meaning in the real life.
A. Experimental Dataset
In the experiment, we use the Yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae microarray datasets from the Stanford University 
yeast cell cycle analysis project website on http://genome-
www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/. We used 6810 yeast genes, 13 
samples and 14 time points in this datasets. And the time 
length between adjacent time points is 30 minutes. Several 
previous researches also use the same yeast datasets [5] [10]
[11].
The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) 
Pathway Database [4] is a collection of manually drawn 
pathway maps depend on experts. It annotates the validly 
metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental 
information processing such as signal transduction, various 
other cellular processes and human diseases regulation 
mechanism. We use this database to estimate the rules that 
we discover is really have Temporal Dependency and 
biological meaning in pathway. The yeast KEGG Pathway 
database that use to verify is downloading from the official 
website on http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html.
However, it still have many regulation mechanisms may 
not be confirmed. Besides, the regulation mechanisms may 
not exist between any genes. Therefore, we will use the Gene 
Ontology (GO) Semantic Similarity method that Wang 
proposed [9] to verify the gene relations with GO database
[1]. The yeast annotate GO database that use to estimate is 
downloading from the official website on 
http://www.geneontology.org/.
B. Describe of Parameters
Table 4 shows the parameters that user define in this 
method. The strictest value of Minimum Support Threshold, 
Coherence Threshold and Minimum Confidence Threshold 
is 1. Moreover, user can define the Pattern Minimum Length 
Threshold to restrict the meaningful minimum continual time 
point number of a reaction. Furthermore, Time-delay 
Threshold to restrict the continual time point number of a 
regulation.

C. Coherence Threshold Analysis
In this section, we discuss the PCC and proposed TS3
influence of pattern and rule numbers satisfied different 
Coherence Threshold. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the result 
that Minimum Support Threshold defines as 0.7 and 0.8 
respectively. Pattern Minimum Length Threshold defines as 
5. Minimum Confidence Threshold defines as 0.9. Time-
delay Threshold defines as 3.

Figure 8. Rule number under different Coherence Threshold. 
Figure 9. MF Semantic Similarity under different Coherence Threshold. 
Figure 10. BP Semantic Similarity under different Coherence Threshold. 
Figure 11. CC Semantic Similarity under different Coherence Threshold. 
It was observed that PCC produced more patterns and 
rules than TS3 in the same parameters. Further, when 
Minimum Support Threshold raises, satisfied pattern and 
rule numbers sink.
Furthermore, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the 
result that we verify the rule with GO Semantic Similarity 
under MF, BP and CC of GO respectively.
It was observed that when define Coherence Threshold 
strictly, the gene expression are more coherently. Therefore, 
the GO Semantic Similarity rises. But, due to satisfied 
pattern and rule numbers sink. It will be more easily to be 
influence of meaningless rules. Therefore, we recommend 
the Coherence Threshold should be defined between 0.88 
and 0.8 in this datasets.
D. Rule Analysis
In this section, we verify the rules that discovering 
depend on proposed TS3 similarity measurement. First, we 
used the parameters on Table 5 to discover rules. After that, 
we observe these rules mapping to this Pathway. The 
Overlapping type rule “Fus3;0;4?Far1;3;7” can mapping to 
the Cell Cycle Pathway. Gene Fus3 (YBL016W) will 
regulate gene Far1 (YJL157C) to active a Phosphorylation 
[8]. Moreover, the Overlapping type rule “Swi5;0;4?
Sic1;1;5” also can mapping to this Pathway. Gene Swi5 
(YDR146C) will regulate gene Sic1 (YLR079W) in the cell 
division stage [7]. This is an important regulation to the next 
Cell Cycle.
Secondly, we used the parameters on Table 5 to discover 
rules. After that, we observe these rules mapping to the 
Glycolysis Pathway. The rule “PGI1;0;4? PFK2;0;4?
PFK1;3;7” can mapping to this Pathway. Gene PGI1 will 
regulate gene PFK2 and gene PFK2 will regulate gene PFK1 
[2].

Minimum Confidence Threshold 0.9 0.9

E. Similarity Factors Analysis
In this section, we will discuss the similarity factors in 
the rules that we discovered. Figure 12 show the Coherent
Patterns in the rule “Fus3;0;4?Far1;3;7” that measure with 
???
TS3 when the Coherence Threshold define as 0.9. We 
observed that it has Scale relations between the samples in 
this Coherent Patterns for gene Fus3. And in the Coherent
Patterns for gene Far1, it has Shift relation between samples. 
However, if we want to discover this rule that measure the 
Coherent Patterns with PCC. The Coherence Threshold must 
define less than 0.75. It will discover a lot of rules that 
maybe without biological meaning. 
Figure 12. Similarity factors in the Coherent Patterns that TS3 discovered. 
F. Rule Redundant Rate Analysis
One gene maybe can discover different Coherent Patterns 
with different sample set, in the same times points. But, these 
Coherent Patterns maybe have the same biological meaning.
In this section, we will discuss the Rule Redundant Rate 
between PCC and TS3. And observe the efficiency of rule 
discovery. We define the Rule Redundant Rate as follow 
function 2.

parameters, TS3 is more efficiency then PCC manifestly.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This research proposed the 3D-TDAR-Mine algorithm to 
discover the Temporal Dependency Association Rules in 3D 
microarray datasets. The rules discovered by 3D-TDAR-
Mine can reveal gene expressions reactions and the 
regulation mechanism between reactions. Meanwhile, we 
proposed the TS3 similarity measurement to estimate the 
Coherent Pattern that considers the Shifting, Scale and Trend 
factors in the real life. After rule discovering, we verify the 
Temporal Dependency Association Rules with KEGG 
Pathway and GO Semantic Similarity. It’s also confirmed 
that the discovered rules are really with Shifting, Scale, 
Trend relation and biological meaning.
In the future, we will enhance the algorithm to discover 
the rules more efficiently in terms of time and memory cost. 
Furthermore, we will also try to use other data mining 
methods and biological information to filter out the rules 
without biologic meaning so that. we may help biologists use 
the rules more easily and efficiently.
