Abstract—This paper introduces improving rate and 
proposes the incremental mining algorithm with the 
weighted model for optimizing association rules based on 
CBA mining algorithm. The risk analysis of the strong 
association rules is proposed for trend forecasting. And the 
risk degree of the lost rules based on the incremental mining 
is also analyzed. Comparing with the traditional algorithm, 
the improved algorithm is fast, efficient in incremental data 
mining and can find trends in association rules. The decision 
making reliability is enhanced by the association rules 
obtained from the improved algorithm. The algorithm was 
used in bank cost analysis with test results showing that the 
prediction precision of the algorithm is better than that of 
the traditional algorithm.

?.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Data Ming means extracting potential and valuable 
information from a mass of data and forecasting 
development trends. Data mining is the new field with 
fast development, and it is the crossover application field 
of many study fields. Data mining is very important for 
the decision-making system in every walk of life. 
Association rules mining in transaction data is the 
important portion of data mining research. 
Apriori algorithm is the way that is commonly used 
for mining association rules’ frequent item set. But it 
mostly finds association rules from the static information 
database. In factual application, this algorithm has some 
shortcoming. The paper analyzes the change of the strong 
association rules with data updating in database by 
incremental mining algorithm according to factual need of 
decision-making. We analyze the strong association rules 
by the weighted model and consider the risk degree of the 
lost association rules. Accordingly, we improve the 
significance of incremental updating association rules 
mining and efficiently forecast the trend of rules. 
 
?. TRADITIONAL CBA ALGORITHM 
 
Although association rules roots in POS, it can be 
used in many fields. The basic data mining processes of 
association rules are: first, choose right element, decide 
different statistic level, choose specific degree, and only 
with element appearance degree in data is the same. The 
effect of association rules is the best; second, produce 
rules, then propose sup. and cof. Given one transaction 
data set D , association rules mining’s work is to find 
association rules that is not less than the appointed min-
sup and min-cof. 
CBA is one traditional mining algorithm using in bank 
cost analysis. CBA is classification based on association. 
This algorithm integrates classification mining algorithm 
and association rules mining. CBA algorithm produces 
classifier through two processes. The first process, find 
classification association rules(CAR). The second 
process, choose high prior degree rules for cover training 
set from the discoverable CAR, that is, if the left of the 
associations rules are the same and the right of them are 
different, we choose high-cof. rules as possible rules. 
After obtaining association rules that satisfy the min-sup 
and min-cof. between the conditional attributes and the 
decision attributes, the importance of the rules is defined 
as[4]: the importance of rule A is ( )imp A , rule A   and 
B  is given. 
If  ( ) ( )cof A cof B> ,then, ( ) ( )imp A imp B> ; 
If  ( ) ( )cof A cof B= , sup( ) sup( )A B> ,then, 
( ) ( )imp A imp B> ; 
If ( ) ( )cof A cof B= , sup( ) sup( )A B= ,rule A  is 
created before rule B ,then,  ( ) ( )imp A imp B> ; 
The algorithm is as follows: 
( )R sort R= ; 
for each rule r R?  in sequence do  
tcmp = ?  
for each case d D?  do 
if d   satisfies the conditions of r then store .d id  in 
tcmp  and mark r  if it correctly classifies d ; 
if r  is marked then insert r  at the end of C ;

delete all the cases with the ids in temp from D ; 
select a default class for the current C ; 
compute the total number of errors of C ; 
end 
end 
find the first rule p  in C  with the lowest total number 
of errors and drop all the rules after p  in C ; 
add the default class associated with p  to end of C , and 
return C . 
 (our classifier) [4]. 
Traditionally, CBA was used in bank cost analysis.  In 
part 2 and part 3, we’ll discuss a new mend of the original 
algorithm. 
 
?. INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPROVING-RATE FACTOR 
 
The higher the cof. is, the stronger the association 
rules is, namely, the strong association rule. But 
sometimes it is wrong. In circumstance of precondition 
and conclusion both with high-sup, although the 
precondition and conclusion are irrelative, their 
association cof. is high. One better way to judge the 
intensity of association rules is to compare the cof. with 
the standard value of the rule, here we suppose that 
relative item set’s generant probability created with every 
rule and generant probability of former item set is 
independent. We can use frequent item set’s frequency to 
calculate the standard value. Standard cof. is the 
concomitantly generant association’s sup divided by the 
number of transaction in database. And this can help us 
calculate “the improving-rate” of the rule. “The 
improving-rate” is the cof. of the rule that is divided by 
the cof. of generant association supposed to be 
independent. If the rate is bigger than 1, it means that the 
rule is useful. And the bigger “the improving rate’’ is, the 
higher the association rule’s intensity is. 
 
?. INCREMENTAL MINING ALGORITHM 
 
Apriori algorithm is the way that mines and analyzes 
the static information data. When the data in database 
keeps invariability, it is useful. But when the data is 
changed, it needs to scan the new database over again for 
adapting the increase of data in database. With the 
updating of the database, the original rules are not likely 
to keep identical. In the modern data management 
circumstance that information increases rapidly, it results 
in much repeated work and over-load of database’ s 
operation. And it wastes the original result obtained by 
old database mining. 
We use the incremental mining algorithm to mend the 
original algorithm. The incremental mining algorithm 
takes full advantage of the old mining results and mines 
updating association rules with the incremental portion of 
the database. And it can efficiently decrease the database 
scanning times and sufficiently improved the efficiency of 
data mining. Suppose D for the original database, and d 
for changing data set. The incremental updating of the 
association rules mostly means how to get association 
rules of D d?  when the new data set d is added to the 
original database D or d is deleted from D with the 
changeless min-sup and the changeless min-cof 
(sometimes they can changed). For the incremental 
updating database, incremental mining concerns the 
following four instances of item set: (1) frequent in D , 
frequent in d , then frequent in D d? ; (2) frequent in D, 
not frequent in d , then uncertain in D d? ; (3) not 
frequent in D, frequent in d , then uncertain in D d? ; 
(4) not frequent in D , not frequent in d , then not frequent 
in D d? . 
For satisfying high efficiency updating of association 
rules, it creates many kinds of data mining algorithm as 
FUP, IUA, AIUA, NEW FUP and FUFIA. 
FUP algorithm solves (1), (2) and (4), but it can not 
solve the third. IUA and NEW FUP algorithm solve (3), 
but the efficiency isn't high. 
 
?. IMPROVEMENT OF ORIGINAL ALGORITHM BY 
INCREMENTAL MINING ALGORITHM 
 
In Apriori algorithm of original association rules 
mining, if the database is updated, the rules created by 
original database mining will be not appropriate. The 
ecumenical way is to mine the new database again using 
the algorithm. In the modern data management 
circumstance that information increases rapidly, it results 
in much repeated work and over-load of database’s 
operation. And it wastes original result obtained by old 
database mining. The ameliorative algorithm pays 
attention to the trends of rules development when mines 
database by association rules algorithm. The new 
algorithm reduces the number of database scan, and 
improves efficiency of data mining. It has better precision 
in decision-making support. 
We use incremental mining algorithm to mend the 
original algorithm. For protecting rules, we present a rule 
protection model with weight. This rule protection model 
with weight will exert forecast function in the latter work 
of incremental mining. Suppose 1W  and 2W  are the 
weight of D  and d respectively. For association rule 
X Y? , we define the sup and cof. as the following[5]: 
1 1
2 2
( ) ( )
( ), ( )
( ) / ( )
Supp w X Y W Supp X Y
W Supp X Y confw X Y
Supp w X Y Supp w X
=
+ ? =
  
? i ?
i ?
?
 
11
Here, 1( )Supp X Y?  and 2 ( )Supp X Y?  are the 
rule’s X Y?  sup. in D  and d  respectively. 
( )Suppw X Y?  and ( )confw X Y? are the rule`s 
X Y? sup. and con. in D d?  respectively. 
For association rule X Y? , its sup. and cof. are 
defined as the following[5]: 
1 1
1 1
( ) ( )

( ) ( )
( ),
n n

Supp w X Y W Supp X Y
W Supp X Y
Confw X Y W Conf X Y
W Conf X Y
 = + +
? = ? + +
?
? ? "
?
"
 
Here, ( )iSupp X Y? and ( )nConf X Y? are rule’s 
( X Y? ) sup. and  cof. in incremental set iD . 
First, we use AIUA( advanced incremental updating 
algorithm ) to mend  incremental association rules when 
min-sup isn’t changed. The algorithm need respectively 
scan only once the original database and the new 
incremental database. 
The algorithm is as the following [6]: 
Input: DB , the original transaction database 
L , the set of DB ’s frequent item set  
db ; 
0S ,the min-sup 
Output: ''L , the set of DB db? ’s frequent item set 
(1) ''L ?=  
for each X L?  do begin 
if X .count 0 (| | | |)L S DB db? × + , then     
{ }'' ''L L X= + ; 
{ }FL L X= ? ; 
Else max max{ sup | }D i iS x D x L? =  ?  
end 
(2) min 0 max 0( )d DS S t S S? ?= ? × ? ; 
for each x db? do begin 
if X . count 0 (| | | |)db S DB db? × + then 
{ }'' ''L L X= + ; 
{ }db db x= ? ; 
else 
'
min{ | .

end 
(3) for each FX L?  do begin 
for each 'x L? do begin 
if X .count FL X+ .count 
'
0 (| | | |)L S DB db? × +   
then 
'' '' { }L L X= +  
' ' { }L L X= ?  
else  { }F FL L X= ?  
end 
end 
(4) ' ' min 0{ | , }d dL L x S x Supd S?= ? ?  ?  
(5) if 'dL ?=  then output ''L  
else for each 'dx L? ,do begin 
max max{ sup | }d i iS x d x L? =  ?  
min 0 max 01/ ( )D dS S t S S? ?= ? × ?  
  end 
end 
(6) min( , )D k DL aproiri gen L S ?= ?   
(7) for each 'dx L?  do begin  
for each DX L?  do begin  
if X .count DL X+ .count
'
0 (| | | |)dL S DB db? × +   
then 
" " { }L L X= +   
else delete X  
end 
end 
(8) output "L  
Here: X .count L , X .count db , X .count FL  , X 
.count L?  , X .count DL  and X .count dL?  are item set X 
sup in L , db , FL  , L?  , DL  and dL?  respectively. 
Then, we calculate significative association rules’ 
sup and cof in new database using the rule protection 
model with the weight. Calculate sup( x ) in 
/ sup( )D d x?  in 1D ?  and cof( x ) in 
/ ( )D d cof x?  in 1D ? , then we get 1T  and 2T  . 
Here we call them T. T reflects change trend of the 
strong association rules on the basis of incremental 
mining. We analyze and forecast the useful association 
rules by the change trends with database updating every 
time. Thereby, it supports the decision-making better. 
On the other side, we study the lost rules that were the 
strong association rules in the original database after 
database updating. Calculate sup( x ) in D d?  and cof( 
x ) in D d? , and get T . The absolute value of T shows 
the eliminated risk when the strong association rules in 
the original database are changed with updating data. The 
12
absolute value of  T for the lost association rules, it is 
defined as risk degree of the lost. In practical application, 
people often concern the risk of the strong association 
rules in the original database, which is the risk of being 
weak with periodic increase of database. We can also 
regard the risk degree as the risk that the strong rules turn 
into the weak rules or the weak rules turn into the strong 
rules. Higher the risk degree is, lower the universality of 
the rule is. The introduction of risk degree is for the need 
of solving the practical problem. It forecasts the trends of 
association rules based on incremental mining from the 
different aspect and increases the reliability of 
forecasting. 
 
?. THE APPLICATION OF IMPROVED ALGORITHM IN BANK 
COST ANALYSIS 
 
In process of bank cost analysis, we analyze the basic 
product attributes and product cost. Based on it, we get 
the rule that product’s profit is relative to one or some of 
the attributes and obtain idiographic association rules. The 
data mining process of bank cost analysis includes: 
gathering of data, data pretreatment, model training and 
model evaluating. 
We analyze the six months statistic information of 
bank product. The former five months’ data is the original 
database. And the sixth months’ data is the incremental 
data. We use the original algorithm and the improved 
algorithm to mine the bank cost analysis database. 
The result shows that the improved algorithm is better 
than the original CBA algorithm. The precision of cost 
analysis is improved 30 percent. So, with the improved 
algorithm, we can efficiently mine association rules and 
mend incremental data mining in database, then improve 
precision of decision-making. 
 
?. CONCLUSION 
 
We introduce the improving-rate factor to increase the 
precision for optimizing the original algorithm, and 
present the improved algorithm for mining incremental 
data in database. With the data of one bank’s six months 
statistical information, we test the new algorithm and 
compare it with the original algorithm. The result shows 
that the improved algorithm improves the reliability of 
data mining, and provides more information for decision-
maker.
