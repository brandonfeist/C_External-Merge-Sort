Abstract—Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most 
useful techniques, which are used to detect the incipient faults 
of power transformer. In the past decade, various fault 
diagnosis techniques have been proposed that include the 
conventional ratio method to detect the incipient faults of 
power transformer. In the paper, rough set is presented to 
generate association rules which are used to fault diagnosis of 
power transformer. Rough set can mine the deep relation, 
association rule of power transformer is gained by rough set. 
By reduction of rough set, redundant feature attribute which 
affects the classification performance will be deleted. Then, 
association rule of power transformer is gained. The 
experimental results indicate that the method has very good 
results.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most useful 
techniques, which are used to detect the incipient faults of 
power transformer[1]. The fault related gases include 
methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), ethylene 
(C2H4).In the past decade[2], various fault diagnosis 
techniques have been proposed that include the 
conventional ratio method to detect the incipient faults of 
power transformer[3]. The conventional gas ratio method is 
based on experience in fault diagnosis using DGA data. 
Rough set is a new mathematical approach, which has the 
function of imprecision, vagueness and uncertainty[4,5]. 
Rough set philosophy is founded on the assumption that we 
associate some information[6-8]. In the paper, association 
rules will be gained by rough set, and used to fault 
diagnosis of power transformer. Rough set can mine the 
deep relation, association rules of power transformer is 
gained by rough set. CH4/C2H4,C2H2/C2H4, C2H4/C2H6, 
C2H2/C2H6, C2H6/CH4,C2H2/CH4 can reveal the relation 
between the gases ratios and failure in power transformer, 
and the feature gases are used to construct 6 ratios. By 
reduction of rough set, redundant feature attribute which 
affects the classification performance will be deleted. Then, 
association rules of power transformer is gained. The 
experimental results indicate that the method has very good 
results. 
II. ROUGH SET 
Rough set is a very important information processing 
tool, by the tool, the problem with imprecise, uncertain and 
vague information will be solved. Define an information 
system S <U, A, V, f>, where U denotes a nonempty finite 
set, A denotes a nonempty finite set of attributes, A=C?D , 
where C represents the conditional attributes, D represents 
the decision attributes. V is the value domain, f is an 
information function. It is necessary for us to find out the 
key conditional attributes with the reference to the 
decision-making because the decision table obtained may 
be huge. The process of rough sets will comprise the 
following parts: 
1) If the data is not discrete, the data must be scattered; 
2) Decision table will be constructed by using all 
descriptors, and discernibility matrix will be constructed by 
using all descriptors; 
3) Decision table will be constructed by using specific 
reduct, discernibility matrix will be constructed by using 
specific reduct; 
4) The redundant condition attributes are deleted, and 
the repetitious rows are deleted.  
III. ASSOCIATION RULES GAINED BY ROUGH SET 
The fault related gases include methane (CH4), 
acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), which 
can reflect the states of transformer. 
CH4/C2H4,C2H2/C2H4,C2H4/C2H6,C2H2/C2H6,C2H6/CH4,C2H
2/CH4 can reveal the relation between the gases ratios and 
failure in power transformer, and the feature gases are used 
to construct 6 ratios. As shown in Tab.1, condition attribute 
of decision table of power transformer is composed of the 
following ratios: CH4/C2H4, C2H2/C2H4, C2H4/C2H6, 
C2H2/C2H6, C2H6/CH4, C2H2/CH4,which are represented as 
F1~F6 respectively. Condition attribute of diagnostic 
decision table is the five states of power transformer 
including normal, high energy discharge, low energy 
discharge, high temperature overheating, low temperature 
overheating, which are represented as 1,2,3,4,5 respectively. 
By the reduction of rough set, minimal decision table is 
gained, which is given in Tab.2.
