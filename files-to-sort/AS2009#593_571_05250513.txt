Analyze Large-scale Communication Network Behavior Through
Mining TCP Control Segment Information
Weisong He and Guangmin Hu
Abstract- One difficult task when managing large-scale net-
work traffic flows is that the network operators must deal
~ith a very large number of flow records. In this paper, we
Introduce a new defined TCP flags information analysis method,
proportion-based analysis, which is a better way to narrow the
analyzable flow records. We compute the percentage of different
type of TCP flags among total traffic flows and consider these as
multivariate time series over a duration of time. Furthermore,
we may obtain frequent pattern of different type of TCP flags
using multivariate time series association rule mining method.
Experimental results with backbone network (Internet2) data
confirmed our method.
I. INTRODUCTION
Today,millions of users across the globe communication
with each other via an complex infrastructure, composed
of thousands of networks, which together constitute the
Internet. These networks carry,exchange and deliver traffic
among each other. Network operators try to ensure that
customer traffic is delivered correctly and efficiently. The
popular way of monitoring traffic has been to measure the
amount of traffic exchange between two parties,or passing
over a special network link. In this sense, one typically
consider traffic as a time series of the number of bytes
or the number of packets over a duration of time, and
at certain specified time scale. Monitoring traffic in this
manner gives operators a summary of the traffic load in
their network. As more advanced monitoring technologies
become feasible, operators have more data to process. Except
for traffic volume, operators can also analyze traffic features
in the form of packet headers or packet content. These
comprehensive views of traffic give additional information
about how the communication network is being used, for
example, which applications are dominative, who is talking
to whom, and so on. But, such traffic measurements also
translate to massive datasets, which become obstacle to
manage and analyze. Thus a great challenge is to know
how to effectively process network traffic and propose new
approach to understand network behavior. Let take vehicle
traffic of trunk road for example, if we want to perceive
whether the suspicious car exists or not among the huge
vehicular traffic without checking every car in detail, we
may compute proportion of each type of cars among total
vehicles, construct proportion value multivariate time series.

By analyzing proportion value multivariate time series, we
can monitor vehicle traffic situation.
In this paper, different from volume-based and entropy-
based traffic analysis method [7][8], we analyze large-
scale network behavior by mining TCP flags informa-
tion (accumulation from all packets in the flow) with
proportion-based analysis method. Our contributions are
as follows. Firstly, aiming at analyzing large-scale com-
munication network behavior and compress information,
we propose a new approach, proportion-based analysis,
to comprehend large-scale network situation by comput-
ing the percentage of four types of TCP control segment
flags(SYN,ACK,ACK+FIN,ACK+PSH). Secondly, with pro-
portion information of TCP flags, we may identify the abnor-
mities which appear intangible amongst the immense amount
of legitimate traffic more effectively and accurately. Finally,
in order to determine the pattern of abnormal behavior,we
apply multivariate time series association rule mining method
to obtain association rules of four types of TCP flags.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces
TCP control segment and proportion-based analysis method.
Section 3 introduces Apriori algorithm and multivariate time
series association rule mining method. Section 4 discusses
the concrete experiments. Section 5 concludes the paper.
II. NETFLOW AND TCP CONTROL SEGMENT
A. Netflow
As is shown in Fig. 1, the Netflow which is passive
monitoring tool include: Statistics about groups of related
packets (e.g., same TCP/IP headers and close in time);
Records header information, counts, and time. As can be seen
from Table I, the flow record contents can be divided into two
parts: One is the basic information about the flow; The other
one is information related to routing. The basic information
about the flow are as follows: the first information is source
and destination, IP address and port; the second one is packet
and byte counts; the third one is start and end times; the
fourth one is ToS and TCP flags. The information related to
routing are listed as follows: the first Next-hop IP address;
Source and destination AS; Input and output.
B. tcr Control Segment
The Internet Protocol (IP) provides unreliable datagram
service between hosts.The Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) provides reliable data delivery:It uses IP for datagram
delivery; Compensates for loss, delay, duplication and similar
problems in Internet components. The TCP control segment
structure is shown in Fig.2.

amount of legitimate traffic that is typically found in a
large-scale commun ication network . In order to identify the
abnormities more effectively and accurately, a better way to
narrow the analyzable flow records is required. Fortunately,
for most types of TCP-based worms and other abnorm ities,
there is another useful field in flow records: analysis based
on the TCP flags. In this paper, we propose a new approach
that compute the percentage of four types of TCP control
segment f1ags(SYN,ACK,ACK+FIN,ACK+PSH), construct
proportion multivariate time series. Proportion-based Analy-
sis algorithm is shown in Algorithm I.
J) Features of Tep: The features of TCP are as fol-
lows: connection oriented(an application requests a "con-
nection" to destination and uses connection to transfer
data); point-to-point/a TCP connection has two endpoints,no
broadcast/multicast);reliability(TCP guarantees that data will
be delivered without loss, duplication or transmission cr-
rors) ;full duplex(endpoints can exchange data in both di-
rections simultaneously );reliable connection startup(TCP
guarantees reliable, synchronized startup between endpoints
using "three-way handshake") ;gracefully connection shut-
down(TCP guarantees delivery of all data after endpoint
shutdown) .
2) Three Way Handshake: Three way handshake is
shown in Fig. 3. Detail steps can be described as follows:
Step J: Client (active open) sends TCP SYN segment
to server;
Step 2: Server (passive open) host receives SYN, replies
with SYNACK segment;
Step 3: Client receives SYNACK, replies with ACK
segment, which may contain data .
3) Proportion-based Analysis Method: We've seen many
times there are moderately intensive worms and other abnor-
mal activities which appear intangible amongst the immense

process is repeated until no more large itemsets are found.
Apriori is more efficient during the candidate generation pro-
cess [2]. Apriori uses pruning techniques to avoid measuring
certain itemsets, while guaranteeing completeness.These are
the itemsets that the algorithm can prove will not turn out to
be large. However there are two bottlenecks of the Apriori
algorithm. One is the complex candidate generation process
that uses most of the time, space and memory. Another
bottleneck is the multiple scan of the database.
2) Multivariate TIme Series Association Rules Mining:
Unlike general association rules mining, the time of data
point should be focused on when we using multivariate time
series association rules mining. Each feature elements have
different value at each time, so we apply association rule
mining to different values of different network feature within
the same time interval. We can regard the change of different
proportion value with time as a multivariate time series. It
is necessary for us to find out the frequent pattern of such
multivariate time series. The anomalous changes which are
resulted from one time series may affect the changes of other
time series simultaneously. This rule lays the foundation for
us to analyze the complex network behavior. Multivariate
time series association rules mining(MTSARM)algorithm is
shown in Algorithm2.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Data Sets
The sampled flow data collected from the backbone
networks: Abilene [1]. Abilene is the Internet2 backbone
network, connecting over 200 US universities and peering
with research networks in Europe and Asia. It consists of
11 Points of Presence (PoPs), spanning the continental US
which is shown in Fig.4. Sampling is periodic, at a rate of
1 out of 100 packets.
B. Experimental Results
We collect Netflow data of IPLSng router from
08:05 a.m. on January 14th, 2007 to 08:00 a.m. on
January 15th, 2007. We firstly compute proportion
of each type of TCP flags within each time bin.
We analyze four time series of proportion value
S(SYN),S(ACK),S(ACK+FIN),S(ACK+PSH) by
multivariate time series association rules mining
method. We apply PAA and SAX to the proportion
value time series to obtain symbolic series. Let
S(SYN)=I,S(ACK)=2,S(ACK+FIN)=3,S(ACK+PSH)=4,'A'
to 'D' denotes entropy value that change from low to high.

n i=N(i-1)+1
n is the length of sequence, N is the number of PAA
segments. Pi is the average value of the ith segment.
The basic idea of Symbolic Aggregate approxima-
tion(SAX) [3][5]is that it converts the time series into an
discrete symbolic sequence. Having transformed a time series
data into the PAA, we can apply SAX to obtain a discrete
symbolic representation. Since normalized time series have a
Gaussian distribution, we can determine the breakpoints that
will produce c equal-sized areas under Gaussian distribution
curve [6]. Breakpoints are a sorted list of numbers B ==
/31 ,/32, ... ,/3c-1, such that the area under a N (0, 1) Gaussian
distribution curving from /3i to /3i+1== ~ ( /30 and /3c are
defined as -00 and 00, respectively).
B. Symbolic Representation of TIme Series
The basic idea of Piecewise Aggregate Approxima-
tion(PAA) [3][5]is that it represents the time series as a
sequence of rectangle basis functions. It is a dimensionality-
reduction representation method in essential as in Eq.(I):

where a(X) == l{tilX ~ ti.t, E T}I.Given an itemset X,
we find all the rules X --+ Y with minimum support and
confidence. Support is a probability that a transaction con-
tains , denoted as Sup (X U Y).Confidence is a conditional
probability that a transaction contains X as well as Y, denoted
as Sup(XU Y)jSup(X).Frequent Itemsets is used to generate
all frequent itemsets in a given database T.
Generally, an association rules mining algorithm contains
the following steps: The set of candidate k - itemsets is
generated by l-extensions of the large (k - 1) - itemsets
generated in the previous iteration. Supports for the candidate
k - itemsets are generated by a pass over the database.
Itemsets that do not have the minimum support are discarded
and the remaining itemsets are called large k- itemsets. This
A. Preliminaries
Consider a time series X == X1X2·· ·XT, which is an ordered
sequence of measurements taken for a real-valued variable
X at timestamps 1,2,··· ,T. A multivariate time series ~ ==
{Xi}~ 1 is a collection of time series that corresponds to
measurements for m real-valued variables spanning the same
time interval.
C. Multivariate TIme Series Association Rules Mining
1) Apriori Algorithm: I == {iI, i2, ... , ik} is a set of items.
X is an itemset if it is a subset of I. T == {ti, ti+1,... , tn } is a
set of transaction. A transaction t contains itemset X iff, for
all items, where i E X, i is a t - itemset. All itemset X in a
transaction database has a support, denoted Sup(X) [2] [4],
see as in Eq.(2).

We define rmrurnum support as 0.05(14 instances) and
minimum confidence as 0.9, and we apply association rules
mining to alphabet sequence to get association rules of the
feature pattern in the backbone IPLSng router. Generated
sets of frequent itemsets :
Size of set of frequent itemsets L(l): 16
Size of set of frequent itemsets L(2): 57
Size of set of frequent itemsets L(3) : 22
Size of set of frequent itemsets L(4) : 1
The best rules is shown as follows:
Rule 1 : 3A,4B ==* 1D,supp = 14,conf = 100%
Rule 2 : 3D,4A ==* 2A,supp = 14,conf = 93%
Rule 3 : 2D,3C,4C ==* 1A,supp = 25,conf = 93%
Rule 4 : 2B,3A ==* ID ,supp = 19,conf = 90%
Rule 5 : lC,4A ==* 2A,supp = 19,conf = 90%
With these rules obtained above, we may comprehend
current network behavior.

mining to discrete symbolic sequence to obtain association
rules. From experimental results, we can conclude that our
approach is feasible .

future .
