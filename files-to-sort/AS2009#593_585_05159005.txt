Abstract—currently those algorithms to mine the alarm 
association rules are limited to the minimal support, so that 
they can only obtain the association rules among the frequently 
occurring alarms. This paper proposes a new mining algorithm 
based on spectral graph theory. The algorithms firstly sets up 
alarm association model with time series; Secondly, it regards 
alarms database as a high-dimensional structure and treats 
alarms with associated characteristics as part of it. The 
algorithm discovers the underlying mapping low-dimensional 
structure embedding in high-dimensional space based on 
spectral graph theory. Experimental results based on synthetic 
and real datasets demonstrates that this algorithm not only 
discoveries association among alarms, but also acquires the 
fault in the telecommunications network based on the spectral 
graph transformation.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
A telecommunication network produces daily large 
amounts of alarm data. We could obtain hidden valuable 
association rules from those alarms, find the root reason of 
alarm, and then locate problems by alarm association 
analysis. Currently, the main mining algorithm are: Apriori 
[1], improved algorithm [2~4], and incremental association 
rules algorithm [5]. Those algorithms to mine the alarm 
association rules are limited to the minimal support, so that 
they can only obtain the association rules among the 
frequently occurring alarm events. 
Discovering the association rules algorithm, with the 
minimum support and the minimum confidence, have some 
problems. Because the appropriate minimum support 
threshold could not be selected by the current frequent 
pattern mining algorithms. If the threshold is too low, 
frequent association rules mining approaches may lose 
efficiency and the frequent association rules usually contain 
some items which are weekly related to each other. On the 
other hand, if the threshold is too high, many strong 
association rules involving items with low support levels will 
be missed [6]. 
Analyzing sequential  60,000 alarm records in a true 
alarm database of telecom service providers , we find that 
there are 1738 network elements to report alarms, but only 
28 alarm network elements among them whose support are 
more than 1%, and 1669 network elements whose support 
are less than 1%. It is obvious that it’s important to study the 
associated-rules on non-frequent alarms. In addition, as the 
non-frequent alarm datasets is massive, the mining algorithm 
[1-5] is inefficient to mine non-frequent alarm because it 
needs to scan all of the datasets.  
It’s the key to find and locate the associated alarms in 
mining non-frequent alarms. The clustering algorithms are 
usually used, which firstly divide the alarms into several 
categories with the inherent characteristics, secondly mine in 
different categories. Each category of elements have the 
same characteristics as much as possible, the difference of 
characteristics in different types is as larger as possible. 
Although some clustering algorithms are proposed, such as 
K-means algorithm, DBSCAN algorithm. There are some 
problems in clustering alarm data: 1) it is difficult to 
determine the number of cluster and different data sets 
alarms may have different number of cluster; 2) sometimes 
the types of categories are uncertain. 3) It is very difficult to 
cluster a high dimensional data due to massive data in 
Telecommunication network. This makes it a little difficult 
to use the traditional clustering algorithm in 
Telecommunication network alarms datasets. 
This paper presents a new mining algorithm AAASG 
(Alarm Association Algorithms based on Spectral Graph 
Theory). In AAASG , the alarms database is regarded as a 
high-dimensional structure, all points in the structure is 
partly related, and alarms with associated characteristics can 
be treated as low dimensional structure embedded in it. 
AAASG algorithm clusters the alarm data by finding 
potential low-dimensional manifold structure of cluster in 
high-dimensional data space. The algorithm first clusters the 
alarm data by frequency of alarm, then reduces the 
dimension and projects the alarms into low-dimensional 
space, finally provides the relationship between alarms to 
administrator in visualization methods so that the 
administrator can effectively limit mining scope with visual 
results and do directional mining to reduce the scope of the 
data scanning.

A.  Alarm associated window 
We consider the input as a sequence of alarms, where 
each alarm has an associated time of occurrence. Given a set 
E of alarm types, an alarm event is a pair(A,t), where A?E 
is a alarm type and t is the occurrence time of the alarm. An 
alarm sequence S on E is a triple(s, Ts, Te), where 
s=<(A1,t1),(A2,t2)……(An,tn)>?is an ordered sequence 
of events such that Ai?E for all i=1,…n, Ts is called the

starting time and Te is the ending time , and Ts?ti?Te for 
all i=1,…n 
Formally, a window on a alarm event sequence S= (s, Ts, 
Te) is a alarm event sequence W=(w, ts, te), where ts<Te and 
te>Ts, and w consists of those pairs(A,t) from s where ts?ti
?te. The time span te - ts is called the width of the window 
w, and it is denoted width (w). Given an alarm event 
sequence S and a win, we denote by W(S,win) the set of all 
windows w on s such that width(w)=win.  
Example: <(A,13), (A,36), (B,36), (B,119), (C,142), 
(A,168), (E,293). (F,312)>.  
As shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure.1 The Example of alarm series 
 
The essence of the width of the window is to determine 
the largest interval of associated alarm. It is thought that 
only alarms that have taken placed in the width of the 
window are associated. The width will affect the 
granularities of the associated rules. 
The sliding step of the window must be selected in 
scanning alarm datasets. If the step is longer, the algorithm 
efficiency will be higher and the accuracy of the rules will 
be lower; on the other hand, if the step is short, the 
algorithm efficiency will be lower, while the accuracy of the 
rules will be improved. In order to ensure windows 
overlapped sufficiently, the slide step is usually selected 
more than half of sliding window. 
B. Alarm association 
The purpose of alarm association analysis is to 
discover the root alarm caused by fault and locate fault by 
analyzing the association of the massive alarms and filtering 
the redundant alarms. Alarm association analysis can not 
only be used to assisting locating fault but also to predicting 
the fault. Some equipment’s alarms have strong associations 
because network faults have the characteristics of spread 
and there are associations in various equipments and the 
modules of the equipment. 
Definition1 association alarm 
There are two or more alarms, if the frequency of 
alarms which appeared simultaneously in associated 
windows w is greater than the threshold, they are called 
association alarms.  
If 1 2, ,..., iA A A?  are association alarms, we say that

Where freq(Ai) is the frequency of alarm Ai  occurred in

freq(A1 ? A2… ? Ai) is the frequency of alarm 
A1,A2, …,Ai  occurred simultaneously in different associated 
window. 
III. ALARM ASSOCIATION ALGORITHMS BASED ON 
GRAPH MODEL 
Alarm data can be seen as a high-dimensional Euclidean 
space?={A1,A2,…,AN}, Ai?RD. Each alarm type is a point in 
the space of RD, every point is partially associated with each 
other, and different faults correspond with different point 
structure of high-dimensional space. We mine the associated 
point structure embedding in the space of RD based on 
spectral graph theory. Firstly, the algorithm builds the 
association alarm model with time series; secondly, 
discovers the structure of low-dimensional manifolds 
embedding in the high-dimensional space based on spectral 
graph theory and displays the point structure by 
visualization.  
The AAASG algorithm works as follows:  
1) Sets up the alarm association graph with time series; 
2) Calculates the similar matrices of alarm and 
discovers low-dimensional manifolds structure in the high-
dimensional space.  
A. sets up the alarm association graph  
Studying the spectrum map of the matrix, we discovery 
the implicit information in the graph. There are some 
associations among the alarm data in the associated window 
w. Therefore, the algorithm extracts alarms within time 
interval T with time series and obtains the frequency of 
alarms in associated window. To create the alarm associated 
graph, our AAASG algorithm takes the parameters shown in 
Table 1.

Where fmn is the frequency of alarm An in m’th window. 
Step 2: We then generate set V=(A1,A2,…,Ap), V??, by 
using the alarm type set ?  as the vertex of the graph. 
Finally, we generate the set E by using the Co-
occurrence(different alarm types appeared in same alarm 
windows ) relationship  to construct the edge, where the 
weight of edge is the Co-occurrence strength Wij of different 
321
alarm types appearing simultaneous in the window w. it can 
be expressed as the adjacency matrix.

Where Wij is the weight of edge between vertex Vi and Vj. 
If Wij is not equal to zero, it means there is an edge with 
weight Wij between the vertex Vi and Vj; otherwise there is no 
edge between them. Thus, the alarm dataset can be expressed 
as a associated map GT(V,E), where T is the identification of 
the Time interval. GT(V,E) is the alarm associated map in the 
time interval, such as 1 hour’s, 2hours’ alarm distribution 
map. Obviously, the map of alarm association is changing 
with time; similarly, the weight of edge in the graph model is 
changing with time too. 
B. Alarm Data Visualization Algorithm 
Alarm data is the sample data of high-dimensional (D 
dimensional) space. Generally, the alarm is not filled in the 
space of RD, otherwise there is no useful information in 
dataset. In fact, those data exist in low-dimensional 
manifolds of the high-dimensional space, where the 
dimension of manifolds is the intrinsic dimension of the data. 
Classic techniques, such as principal component analysis 
(PCA) algorithm[7] and multi-dimensional scaling analysis 
(MDS)[8] algorithm, to deal with high dimensional data is to 
lower the dimension by linear methods, but these algorithms 
can only find the linear structure in high-dimensional space. 
Isomap algorithm [9] is an effective algorithm based on 
manifold learning to nonlinear higher-to-lower 
dimensionality, which is not only able to reveal the intrinsic 
structure of the high-dimensional observation data, but also 
to discover the map of low-dimensional parameter space. It 
first calculates manifolds geodesic distances, and then 
applies it as input to classical MDS. The [10] proves the 
existence of Isometries between a continuous high-
dimensional data and low-dimensional manifolds parameter 
space. 
AAASG algorithm, based on Isomap, first calculates 
geodesic distance on Manifolds; and then creates weighted 
similar distance matrix with the alarm characteristics; finally 
finds the low - dimensional structures embedded in high-
dimensional space by applying MDS to the similar distance 
matrix. It uses geodesic distances between data to reserve 
inherent geometric distribution. The algorithm consists of 
four steps to obtain low-dimensional manifolds structure in 
the high-dimensional space. 
Step1: Compute shortest paths. 
According to the alarm associated relationship graph 
GT(V,E), the algorithm estimates the geodesic distances 
dM(i,j) on the manifold M by computing their shortest path 
distance dG(i,j) between all pair of points in the graph G to 
obtain the matrix DG=dG(i,j), which is in the shortest 
distance between any two points in graph G. 
Step 2: Generate a similar distance matrix  
The purpose of the algorithm is to discover the 
association between alarms, so it need to calculate the 
similarity matrix S=(sij) by using DG T = {dG(i,j)}, where 
S’=S, and sij?sii. A similar distance matrix DS T = d(i,j) can 
be gotten from S because there is some association between 
Similarity coefficient and distance. When the similarity 
coefficient matrix is a non-negative matrix, it is concluded 
that DS  is a Euclidean distance matrix by theorem in [11] . 
Step 3:  Construct d-dimensional embedding  
Apply classical MDS to construct an embedding of the d 
dimensional Euclidean space Y, as detailed in [9]. 
IV. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS 
In order to demonstrate the validity of our proposed 
algorithm AAASG, two experiments are shown here. One is 
on the artificial data sets, and the other is on the data sets 
obtained from a province’s Network Management Center 
alarm dataset. 
A. Experiment on the artificial data sets 
In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm 
AAASG, our experiment use the same data in [1] to compare 
with WINEPI Frequent result set. As shown in figure1. We 
generated 2 maximum frequent item sets: CEF, CEAB by 
setting windows W = 5S and step s = 2s. 
It is clear in figure 2 that maximum frequent item sets are 
CEF and ABCE, and D is far from the other alarms. 
Therefore, in mining association rules alarm, we can mine in 
2 different dataset respectively with CEF and ABCE. This 
can not only improve the efficiency of algorithms by 
reducing the data sets, but also can improve the accuracy of 
the algorithm by reducing the impact of interference noise on 
the association rules. 
 
Figure.2 The structure of alarm in synthetic datasets 
B. Experiment on actual alarm data sets 
The simulated alarm in [1] is frequent, but there are a lot 
of non-frequent alarms in the actual network management 
dataset. The key to this algorithm is to classify these alarms 
and observe their trend. A province’s Telecom network 
management center’s alarm dataset (about 150,000 records) 
is used in the experiment. Alarm identification (name of 
alarm network element, equipment manufacturers, network 
element type, alarm type, alarm level, the reasons of failure) 
and the occurrence time (unit s) are selected as keywords 
322
,window is set to 5 min and sliding step is set to 2 min. After 
visualization, the (N-1) T-interval point structure and the N 
T-interval point structure respectively are shown as in Figure 
3 and Figures 4. Every graph is a mined alarm point structure 
distribution in 1 hour. (The alarm type is expressed by 
numbers in the figure, such as 2952 in categories A stands 
for the 2952th alarms). 
  
Figure.3 The structure of alarms in No. (N-1) interval 
 
Category A and B in Figure 3 and 4 are the same parts 
in two continuous intervals and C is the increased alarm 
mode (that is a fault) at the N T-interval time. 
 
Figure.4 The structure of alarms in No. (N-1) interval 
 
The change of alarm mode can be observed in the 
distribution maps of alarm, it means that the distribution of 
alarms will be changed to Figure 4 from Figure 3 due to a 
failure.  If there is no new fault, the alarm distribution and 
point structure will not change. When a new fault takes 
place, the distribution of alarm will be obviously changed.  
V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we present a fast algorithm; Alarm 
Association Algorithms based on Spectral (AAASG), which 
is totally different from the framework of support - 
confidence. The algorithm can mine the association not only 
among the frequently occurring alarms but also among the 
non-frequently occurring alarms. Experimental results 
demonstrate that the algorithms has the following 
advantage: 1) it can effectively reduce the search data set by 
the distribution of alarm; 2) it can intuitively get association 
between alarm through the point structure graph of alarms; 
3) it can quickly find fault by the changes in the point 
structure and help the networker to quickly locate and clean 
the fault.
