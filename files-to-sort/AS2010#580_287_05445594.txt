Abstract—The purpose of association rule mining is to reveal 
patterns of kinds of knowledge that are not easy to find. 
However, it may constitute a threat to privacy and information 
security, even more, seriously limit the development of the 
application of data mining, if we can not properly use this 
knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a concept of distributed 
oblivious transfer protocol, then propose and simulate a good 
safe and high efficient association rule mining algorithm with 
distributed oblivious transfer protocol. It can avoid the 
deficiencies caused by centralized data mining, and ensure that 
users can safely interactive statistical information but do not 
involve concrete privacy details, it also can be conveniently 
applied to business management and business decisions.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Along with the computer processing power, storage 
technology, Internet’s fast development, as well as the 
explosive growth of the information that people possess, 
which has inspired people to seek for the desire of “treasures 
of knowledge”, and promoted the development of the 
association rule mining[1,2]. 
The purpose of association rule mining is to reveal 
patterns or kinds of knowledge that are not easy to find. 
However, every thing has two sides, with the development of 
the society and people’s attention to privacy, it may 
constitute a threat to privacy and information security, even 
more, seriously limit the development of the application of 
data mining, if we can not properly use this knowledge; 
besides, a traditional association rule mining algorithm exists 
some shortcomings: (1) Regarding a database may have 
many branch nodes, the network transmission load is 
substantial, if we excavate knowledge from a central server 
for all data; (2) Relative to distributed data mining, 
centralized data mining’s efficiency is very low; (3) Carrying 
out central excavating in the same place for all data will do 
harm to data privacy preserving. In view of the above 
questions, we have proposed and simulated a good safety 
and high efficiency association rule mining algorithm with 
distributed oblivious transfer protocol[3, 4]. 
In this algorithm, it not only can avoid traditional 
drawbacks of centralized data mining but also can find all 
global frequent itemsets satisfying a given support threshold 
under the condition that each site can not obtain others’ 
privacy. In order to ensure that all participants can safely 
interactive statistical information but do not involve concrete 
privacy details, such as the content of the database, size, 
local frequent itemsets, local itemsets thresholds and so on, 
we need to do the following works: each site adds a random 
number to each local frequent itemset of his own so as to get 
corresponding surplus thresholds; all participants carry out 
n
rDOTmk ?),(  protocol; each site subtracts the random 
number that he has added, then sends the final result to R; R 
decrypts it and finds all global frequent itemsets satisfying 
the given support threshold. 
II. TERMINOLOGY AND PRELIMINARIES 
A. Association Rule Mining 
Association rule mining[5,6] is the process involving the 
discovery itemsets that frequently co-occur in a transaction 
database so as to produce association rules that hold for the 
data. 
Assume that a large transaction database D is distributed 
to n sites: ,,...,, 21 nSSS and those local transaction databases 
located in these sites are denote as },,...,,{ 21 nDDD where 
,21 nDDDD ?"? ?= and iD locates in the site 
n)i(1 ??iS . 
Let },...,,{ 21 niiiI = be a set of literals, called items, 
where ),...,2,1( mkik = may be goods in shopping basket or 
insurance customers. Let },...,,{ 21 n
i TTTD = be a transaction 
database, where each transaction iT contains a set of items 
from I , such that ITi ? . A unique identifier TID (stands for 
transaction id) is associated with each transaction. Each 
association rule is defined as an implication of the 
form ,YX ?  where YX  , are frequent itemsets in the 
transaction database, such that ?=?YX . Assume that 
items in an itemset are sorted in lexicographic order. 
Definition 1: sX '  support threshold in D is defined as:  
||/|},|{|:)( DTXDTTXs ??= . 
Definition 2: The confidence of the association 
rule YX ? is defined as: 
)(/)()|(:)( XsYXsXYPYXc ?==? .

Definition3: We assume that sup.X and iX sup. are 
thresholds for a given itemset X in transaction database 
D and iD respectively (If there are iX sup. transactions 
contain ,X the itemset sX ' local threshold is iX sup. in iS and

B. Distributed Oblivious Transfer Protocol 
As we are known that all OT [7] schemes not only require 
public-key operations, such as modular exponentiations, but 
also have high computational complexity, low efficiency, 
high bandwidth consumption, which is likely to become the 
bottleneck in many applications. Therefore, in order to solve 
above questions, Naor and Pinkas[8] first proposed a 
distributed oblivious transfer protocol, in which the task of 
the sender is distributed between several servers. 
A nrDOTmk ?),( scheme involves three types of parties: 
- A sender S which has n secrets .,..., 10 ?nss It is 
convenient to assume that these secrets are elements 
in a finite field .F  
- A receiver R that has a set of inputs ),...,,( 10 r??? , 
where .10 ??? nr . 
- Additional m servers, .,...,1 mSS  
A nrDOTmk ?),( scheme must guarantee the following 
properties: 
Reconstruction. If a receiver gets information from k out 
of m servers, she can compute the secret ,?s  
).,...,,( 10 r???? =  
Sender’s Privacy. Given any k values, a receiver can 
gain information about selected secrets but no information 
about the others. 
Receiver’s Privacy. Any coalition of less than t servers 
can not obtain any information the receiver has recovered, 
where t is a parameter in the range .1 kt ?? The 
parameter t should be as close as possible to k . 
Receiver-servers collusion. A coalition of the receiver 
with l corrupt servers can not learn anything about 
the n secrets more than can be learned by the receiver 
herself. 
An additional requirement is that if the receiver gets 
information from less than k servers she gains no information 
about the n secrets.  
III. THE IMPLEMENT OF DISTRIBUTED OBLIVIOUS 
TRANSFER IN ASSOCIATION RULE MINING 
A. The description of ARDMDOTmk nr ??),( scheme 
First of all, we need to do the following assumptions:  
(1)The number of sites is 3?i , and let 4=i in this paper;  
(2) All participants are semi-honest and provide true 
information.  
The problem that is going to be solved in this paper is 
finding all global frequent itemsets satisfying a given support 
threshold under the condition of each site can not obtain 
others’ privacy. Now we will give a concrete description 
about this algorithm: 
Step 1: S equally distributes the data locates in a large 
transaction database to m sites; 
Step 2: Randomly select a site as the receiver R, after 
that, R sets the value of k and sends it to electronic bulletin 
board for other sites downloading. 
Step 3: R and other sites excavate local frequent itemsets 
using data mining algorithm and send the mining results to 
electronic bulletin board; 
Step 4: S downloads all local frequent itemsets and keeps 
count of the standard frequent itemsets, then publishes them 
to electronic bulletin board; 
Step 5: Every site updates his own local frequent itemsets 
after downloading standard frequent itemsets from electronic 
bulletin board in order to ensure his frequent itemsets’ order 
is consistent with standard frequent itemsets’ (If an itemset 
locates in standard frequent itemsets but not in local frequent 
itemsets, we will add this itemset to the right position for 
local frequent itemset and set its threshold is 0), then they 
add a random number ? for each frequent itemset’s threshold 
and send them to S independently. 
Step 6: all participants execute nrDOTmk ?),( protocol; 
Step 7: After execution above protocol, R can get a set of 
sums of surplus threshold corresponding to each itemset in 
standard frequent itemsets, then sends these results 
)(),...,( 1 rEE ?? that are encrypted by Paillier homomorphic 
encryption algorithm [9] to one of sites iS . 
Step 8: The site iS deducts the random number ? that is 
added in step 5 for each itemset’s threshold, when he 
receives message from R, and sends results 
)()(),...,()( 1 ???? EEEE r ?? to next site until all sites have 
done the same operations. After that, the final result is sent to 
R. 
Step 9: R decrypts a set of surplus thresholds 
corresponding to each itemset in standard frequent itemsets 
and deducts himself random number, then he will be able to 
judge which items are global frequent itemsets satisfying the 
given support threshold. 
B. The scheme of nrDOTmk ?),(  
At present, the study on 1-out-of-2 distributed oblivious 
transfer protocol has a lot and is going to be perfect, but for 
the general form of the n -out-of r distributed oblivious 
transfer protocol has not given a description in detail. Now, 
we will propose a nrDOTmk ?),( scheme bases on 
a nDOTmk 1),( ? scheme. 
Let 10,..., ?nss are sums of surplus thresholds 
corresponding to each itemset in standard frequent itemsets. 
In this paper, considering the requirement of finding all 
205
  
global frequent itemsets that meet given support threshold, 
we not only need to let the number of R’s choices is equal to 
the number of the standard frequent itemsets, in other words, 
satisfying nr = , but also we need to ensure that all 
participants can interact with each other, namely, mk = . 
Initialization Phase: 
(1) S generates 1?n random polynomials

IV. SYNTHETIC EXPERIMENT AND RESULT ANALYSIS 
A. Synthetic Experiment 
To further test our scheme can have high efficiency and 
robustness of the mechanism in practical operation, we 
design a synthetic simulation for ARDMrDOTmk n ?? 1),(   
and ARDMDOTmk nr ??),( . 
With the development of bar code technology, the typical 
example of association rule mining is shopping basket 
analysis. Association rule mining is widely used in the 
transaction database to find patterns in different commodities 
(items), to discovery the model of the customer’s buying 
behaviors, such as the effect of purchasing a commodity on 
purchasing others. The analysis results can be applied to 
shelf layout, warehousing arrangements as well as carrying 
out the classification according to the purchase pattern to the 
user and so on. Therefore, the dataset used in this experiment 
is intercepted from a Belgian supermarket’ real transaction 
records of three times during 1999-2000 years, which 
generates 3.9Mb transaction data according to the normal 
distribution. In this experiment, we have selected 400 records 
and distributed them equally to 4 sites. 
The practical execution performance of two algorithms 
are shown in Figure 1 with support threshold is 2% and 3=k . 
 
 
Figure 1.  Synthetic Result 
B. Result Analysis 
We will give some analyses for our algorithm from the 
following aspects: 
(1) A coalition of all sites cannot learn about R’s choices. 
As we all know, the standard frequent itemsets are 
maintained by all sites in addition to the sender S, therefore, 
except R other sites can obtain some itemsets that are the 
same with R’s, but can not be able to learn corresponding 
threshold, what’s more, they are also unable to learn whether 
R does have other frequent itemsets as well as their 
information in detail. 
Therefore, all sites can not learn R’s choices, even if they 
have acted in collusion with each other. 
(2) Any site can not be able to learn other sites’ 
information, which makes each site’s privacy to be protected. 
In the ARDMDOTmk nr ??),(  algorithm, each site 
carries out excavating local frequent itemsets in their own 
local database, which does not involve the problem of 
privacy infringement. further more, all other participants are 
executing a distributed oblivious transfer when the receiver 
R determines if a itemset is a global frequent itemset or not. 
After execution of the protocol, the receiver reveals these 
secrets at her choices, but obtains no information on others, 
while the sender does not know which secret the receiver has 
recovered, according to the definition of the distributed 
oblivious transfer protocol. In addition, we also do some 
206
  
modifications for transaction information in this algorithm, 
for example, adding a random number for local frequent 
itemsets’ threshold so that a malicious third party can not 
infer concrete information, even if he has captured some 
information. 
(3) Algorithm Complexity 
The main consumption of this algorithm is to be involved 
in the implementation of a distributed oblivious transfer 
protocol. The two algorithms ARDMrDOTmk n ?? 1),( and 
ARDMDOTmk nr ??),( all can solve the problem that 
makes R can obtain all global frequent itemsets under the 
condition of protecting all sites privacies, but the difference 
only lies in the implementation of a distributed oblivious 
transfer scheme. Now, we will give some communication 
complexity and computational complexity analyses: 
Communication Complexity Let u represent the output 
bits of the information that S sends to other sites, v represent 
the output bits of R’s requiring information, w represent the 
output bits of feedback information receiving from other 
sites, then we can learn that the former algorithm’s 
communication complexity is ))(( wvurmO ++ , the later 
algorithm’s communication complexity is 
))(( rwrvumO ++ . 
Computational Complexity For the former, it needs to 
execute r times nDOTmk 1),( ? , but for the later, it only 
demands to execute 1 time nDOTmk 1),( ? and 1?r times 
Lagrange's interpolation. Through some analyses, we can 
learn that 1 time nDOTmk 1),( ? consumes less time cost than 
1?r times Lagrange's interpolation, therefore, our scheme is 
more efficiency. 
Based on the above, we can learn that the algorithm used 
in this paper is better for communication complexity and 
computational complexity, especially confronting massive 
data and the number of frequent itemsets that need to 
determine whether they are global frequent itemsets or not is 
very large, our scheme has better efficiency. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
Not only the network is playing more and more important 
role in today’s social life, but also the association rule 
mining is receiving more and more attention in the business 
management and business decisions, therefore, how to 
efficiently solve the problem of privacy protecting in data 
mining is becoming a hot spot day by day. In the view of the 
practical need of society and the shortcomings caused by 
centralized data mining, we propose and simulate a good 
safety and high efficiency ARDMDOTmk nr ??),(  
algorithm, which not only can meet consumers' demand but 
also can be widely applied to business management and 
business decisions.
