Abstract—This research uses association rule generation and 
classification techniques to support decision making, by 
considering a data set of diabetes type 1 & type 2 patients. 
There are advanced and reliable data mining techniques which 
leads to the discovery of unseen and useful information. The 
main focus of this research is to identify the yet undiscovered 
decision factors of diabetes which increases the possibility of 
the onset of diabetes, as well as to identify the undiscovered 
consequences of diabetes. 
Through the data mining analysis, gender female is identified 
as a major decision factor of high FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar) 
level. Furthermore wheezes and edema were identified as 
unknown side effects of diabetes.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
People all around the world develop various types of 
diseases due to many reasons, and from among them, 
diabetes is one of the most deathly disease. Globally, 
approximately 7 million people develop diabetes each year 
and approximately 3.8 million people die annually due to it, 
which is higher than that due to HIV aids [1]. 
Physicians always work towards saving the lives of their 
patients. Therefore, before prescribing medicines to a patient, 
they usually request the patient to do various tests to ensure 
proper diagnosis of the illness. When diagnosing a disease, a 
physician always takes into consideration the factors or 
attributes which have been identified as risk factors for that 
particular disease.  
As an example, a physician asks a patient to do a glucose 
tolerance test (blood sugar test) after considering his age, 
family history, dietary practices, daily routine complications, 
wounds of the body etc. But there can be several other 
factors such as the sodium level or potassium level in the 
body, educational level, monthly income etc., which also 
increase the risk of developing diabetes. At present, 
physicians do not consider the contribution of gender 
towards the risk of developing diabetes. If all the factors 
which contribute towards the development of diabetes are 
known, then the efficiency of predicting the occurrence of 
diabetes will be greatly enhanced.  
 Advanced analysis need to be carried out to discover the 
unknown factors which contribute towards the development 
of diabetes. In the medical field, physicians usually collect a 
data set and do statistical calculations to extract simple 
patterns from the data. However, by combining IT and using 
data mining techniques, which are advanced and reliable 
methods that have been used in many previous research 
studies [2, 3], undiscovered patterns may be extracted from 
such data sets. The results obtained by those methods can be 
used to treat the patients in more meaningful way.  
 The critical questions addressed through our 
research are, “What are the main undiscovered decision 
factors of diabetes which increases the possibility of the 
onset of diabetes?” and “what are the undiscovered effects of 
diabetes?” 
The main objectives of the research are: 
• To identify the factors which are not considered as 
decision factors of diabetes at present 
• To recognize the undiscovered  patterns of the 
combination of factors which lead to diabetes  
• To identify the effects of diabetes 
• To provide the extracted knowledge from the data 
mining process to domain experts in order to verify 
the results through medical experiments 
This paper is based on preliminary results. The second 
phase of this research is underway at the time of writing this 
paper. The analysis and recommendations presented here are 
preliminary, but provide insight into the landscape of the 
utilization of data mining techniques in knowledge extraction 
for the reduction of diabetes. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II describes the literature of the research, followed 
by research methodology in section III which includes the 
data design and data mining process. Section IV is on the 
results generated by the research. Section V is the discussion 
which contains the comments made by domain experts and 
the key contributions of the research. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
The literature review includes the previous finding about 
diabetes, usage of data mining techniques, diabetes risk 
factors and their relationships and diseases that occurs 
because of diabetes.  
A very large number of people, 246 million suffer from 
diabetes worldwide. 16% of the urban population and 8% in 
the rural areas suffer from diabetes. Mostly people with risk 
are individuals who have not done proper screening to

determine if they have it. The high risk factors include 
diabetic patients in the family, obese people who do not do 
physical exercises and people with unhealthy lifestyle partly 
due to eating more than they require. The age group is also a 
risk factor which has seen more 20-30 year olds being 
affected by diabetes than the 40-50 year olds [4]. 
Most of the people are unaware of the causes of diabetes. 
This has resulted in them not taking sufficient precautions 
and thereby being struck down with the illness. Physicians 
not diagnosing the illness at the early stages also result in 
patients suffering the consequences of the disease.  
Diabetes was selected for this study as it is a serious 
disease which affects all organs and is suffered by many 
people worldwide. The results obtained through this research 
will be invaluable in many ways for many different 
purposes. Physicians, patients and students will all benefit 
through this research. 
Data mining is an essential step of knowledge discovery. 
In recent years it has attracted a great deal of interest in the 
Information Industry. Data mining requires the use of 
advanced statistical algorithms and modeling. In other 
words, it is the combination of Statistics and Artificial 
Intelligence which allows us to explore for patterns in large 
data sets. [5] 
When considering the literature, data mining techniques 
have been used for data analysis in several studies. The 
Health Insurance Commission (HIC), Australia has 
conducted a new research called Data Mining in Disease 
Management in diabetes [2] an application of data mining in 
the management of diseases. This is an attempt to apply data 
mining techniques to analyze the medical service transaction 
data for disease management. They say that their discoveries 
obtained through data mining can be used to educate medical 
practitioners to improve their practice to provide the best 
medical treatment with minimal cost. 
A. Kusiak, K.H. Kernstine, J.A. Kern, K.A. McLaughlin, 
and T.L. Tseng in their research, have addressed the problem 
of predicting outcomes in medical and engineering 
applications [3]. They have solved it with a data mining 
approach which they selected over regression analysis and 
neural networks. They state that neural networks and 
regression models are population based, while the data 
mining approach follows the individual (data object) based 
paradigm, and that this is why they selected the data mining 
approach over the other two.  
Thus, a survey of the literature indicates that many 
researchers have used data mining theory to conduct their 
data analysis.  
Since the focus of this research is to find attributes and 
attribute relationships of diabetes, a study of the literature on 
these aspects was carried out. The following section is a 
discussion of the findings.  
It is often assumed that there is little or no gender bias in 
either type I (insulin-dependent) or type II (non-insulin-
dependent) diabetes [6]. Type I diabetes is the only major 
organ-specific autoimmune disorder that does not show a 
strong female bias [7].  
The equalization in risk is due to the disproportionately 
greater increase in risk in women who develop diabetes 
compared with men who develop diabetes [8]. Identifying 
the causes for this is critical. A previous work has discovered 
risk factors such as HDL and LDL levels in the blood. In that 
work it was established that both male and female diabetic 
patients have lower HDL levels [9].  
A previously conducted research [10] describes the 
factors associated with diabetes for both men and women as, 
being aged 40 years and over, having a low gross annual 
household income, obesity, and a family history of diabetes. 
In addition, being an ex-smoker and having low cholesterol 
levels were associated with diabetes among men [11]. 
Among women, having a high waist-hip ratio, high blood 
pressure and reporting a previous cardiovascular event or 
mental health problem were associated with diabetes [12]. 
But there could be several other factors which increase the 
risk of developing diabetes in both genders. These studies 
have not indicated whether there is a gender bias related to 
diabetes. 
Spanish researchers Asensio Sanchez, Gomez Ramirez, 
Morales Gomezi and Rodriguez Vaca have researched [13] 
the influence of non-ophthalmic parameters as risk factors of 
clinically significant macular edema. Through the research 
they have identified that over half of our CSME (Clinically 
Significant Macular Edema) cases (56.3%) occurred in 
diabetes type 2 in treatment with insulin, against 15.6% of 
diabetes type 2 patients in treatment with oral anti-diabetics.  
Torron Fernandez Blanco, Ruiz Moreno, Ferrer 
Novellae, Sanchez Cano and Honrubia Lopezfm have carried 
out a research [14] to determine the incidence of Cystoids 
Macular Edema (CME) by means of Ocular Coherence 
Tomography (OCT), and to compare the incidence of CME  
between diabetic and non-diabetic groups of patients. Their 
results indicate that OCT showed increased macular 
thickness in both groups of patients in a small percentage of 
cases, and significantly increased macular thickness in 
diabetic patients. 
The literature indicates that there is some relationship 
between diabetes and edema. In the next sections these 
findings are used to prove our results. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
A. Data Design 
This section consists of ‘Data design’ which describes 
gathering data, preparing the gathered data in a way suitable 
for analysis, and the knowledge gained about the project 
domain through the initial data analysis.  
The General Hospital of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka’s main 
national hospital) gave their ethical committee approval to 
access the non sensitive details of diabetes patients. 10,000 
diabetes patients’ records were gathered from the General 
Hospital diabetes clinic patient database. There were more 
than 30 different attributes in the database such as patient ID, 
age, diabetes type, cholesterol level, etc. Due to the sensitive 
nature of the database, it cannot be made public.  
After performing necessary data cleaning processes and 
by running several MS SQL queries, certain attributes were 
selected and a flat table was generated. The attributes 
selected for the flat table were; age, gender, diabetes type, 
4
education, occupation, monthly income, FBS (Fasting Blood 
Sugar), BMI (Body Mass Index), Potassium level, 
Cholesterol level, Sodium level, Diastolic blood pressure, 
Systolic blood pressure, Edema, and Wheezes. 
The flat table prepared in this manner contained more 
than 10,000 records of diabetes patients. But the problem 
with the data table was that other than very few attributes 
(such as salute, gender, married, etc) all the other attributes 
contained missing values. About 7000 data records which 
contained missing values in significant number of attribute 
were removed to reduce the inaccuracy of the data set. 
Remaining 3265 records were divided into small sub groups 
and for each sub group the mean value replacement missing 
data handling mechanism was carried out. Through that 
approach, a table with no missing values was created.  
  Next, a domain analysis was performed. Before the 
data was analyzed using data mining techniques, a domain 
analysis was used to gain an initial understanding of the 
overall project domain. A filtering process was used to do 
the domain analysis.  But a filtering process only looks at the 
data set outwardly and does not include algorithms that 
perform in-depth data analysis to discover the information 
behind the data set. 
Because of this, it is impossible to make highly accurate 
discoveries and draw conclusions about the patterns hidden 
in a data set by performing only a simple analysis. The 
filtering process helps to make assumptions but advanced 
techniques are required for further analysis to identify the 
validity of the assumptions. An advanced data analysis not 
only analyzes the data but it can also extract the hidden 
information behind the data set. The filtering process is not 
sufficient to perform this and therefore further data mining 
process need to be used towards this end. 
B. Data mining process 
The software which was used to perform the data mining 
process is WEKA. WEKA is machine learning/data mining 
software written in Java (distributed under the GNU Public 
License) which is used in research, education, and 
applications. The following are the reasons for selecting 
WEKA for this research [15]. 
• Simple and user friendly interface. 
• Includes a whole range of data preparation, feature 
selection and data mining algorithms. 
• Automatic features are provided in order to simplify 
the mining process 
This section describes the entire data mining process 
followed in order to generate the final results, the 
discretization of the data set and the visualization 
functionality in WEKA to handle the error values in the data 
set.  
1) Discretization of data 
Discretization is an instance filter that discretizes a range 
of numeric attributes in a data set into nominal attributes. 
Data mining techniques require having only nominal 
attributes in the data set. Therefore, data discretization was 
required in order to convert all the numeric attributes into 
nominal attributes. 
The attributes selected for the data table were mentioned 
under the section ‘Data Design’. From those selected, no 
discretization was required for the ‘gender’ attribute (which 
has “F” and “M” groups) and the ‘diabetes type’ attributes 
(which was divided into type 1 and type 2 diseases). Edema 
and wheezes were the last two attributes of the data set 
which contained Boolean values, either ‘true’ or ‘false’. 
Since they are nominal values, no discretization was required 
for them either.  
All the other attributes were discretized to change the 
numeric attribute values into nominal attribute values. 
Discretization was performed by minimizing the number of 
categories for each attribute, to facilitate the data mining 
process and to reduce the complexity. 
2) Handling of error values 
Even after discretization was completed, there were 
still several records that had some mismatching attribute 
values. These errors may have occurred during the missing 
value handling process. These error values needed to be 
removed using WEKA before the data mining technique 
could be continued. WEKA has a feature known as 
“visualize” which enables easy identification of errors or 
abnormal values. The error values of the data set were 
removed using this feature. 
Following Figure 1 shows a sample of the number of 
instances of the final flat table which is used for the 
association rules generation.

IV. RESULTS 
A. Association rules generation- for Diabetes type 2 
• Rule no 1 
age=57_75 gender=F diabetesType=Type 2 
cholesterol=<5.17 wheezes=Yes ==> edema=Yes     
conf:(0.95) 
In this rule “conf:” refers to the confidence of the rule.  
This rule only considers the female, diabetes type 2 patients 
in age range between 57 and 75, whose cholesterol levels are 
greater than 5.17 mmol/L and having wheezes. Confidence 
of the rule defines that out of the above considered set of 
patients, 95% of them are having edema.  
This rule has a higher confidence level as 0.95. The 
cholesterol level in the rule lay below the cholesterol range 
which a normal person has in his blood (normal cholesterol 
level is 5.17-6.21 mmol/L). The rule has also mentioned that 
there is a high probability for the Diabetes type 2 patients to 
occur wheezes, which is not currently proved in the medical 
field. The most important thing which is discovered from 
this rule is that, there is a clear relationship between Edema 
and Diabetes type 2.The following rule which indicates the 
direct relationship between Edema and the Diabetes type 2 
also has a confidence level of 0.94.  
 
diabetesType=Type 2 ==>  edema=Yes conf:(0.93) 
There is some sort of relationship identified in the 
medical field between edema and Diabetes type 2 (mostly 
the cerebral Edema and macular Edema). That relationship is 
further proved with this generated rule. 
With this attribute combination the overall conclusion 
that can be gained is, female Diabetes type 2 patients in 
between 57 and 75 years old who are having low cholesterol 
level in the blood and who are suffering from Wheezes, have 
a higher probability of getting edema disease as a side effect 
of the Diabetes type 2. 
• Rule no 2: 
gender=F occupation=Housewife Sodium Level=135-
145 diastolic=60-80 cholesterol<5.17 edema=Yes 
diabetesType=Type 2 ==> wheezes=Yes     conf:(0.92) 
This rule has a confidence level of 0.92. The sodium 
level and the diastolic blood pressure specified in the rule are 
the general ranges which a normal person has.  
 With this attribute combination the overall conclusion 
that can be gained is, people who are female housewives, 
having normal range of sodium level and diastolic blood 
pressure, low cholesterol level and who are suffering from 
Edema and Diabetes type 2 have a higher probability of 
getting Wheezes. The following rule which indicate the 
direct relationship between the wheezes and Diabetes type 2 
has a confidence level 0.91. It clearly shows that there is a 
relationship between the Wheezes and diabetes type2.  
diabetesType=Type 2 ==> wheezes=Yes  conf:(0.91) 
So, a clear conclusion can be made that there can be a 
strong relationship between the wheezes and the Diabetes 
type 2 and there is a high probability for the diabetes patients 
to get wheezes. 
 
• Rule no 3: 
age=39_56 gender=F cholesterol=<5.17 Sodium 
Level=135-145 ==> diabetesType=Type 2     conf:(0.95)  
This is a rule which has a high confidence level of 0.95. 
The cholesterol level in the rule lay below the normal 
cholesterol level. The sodium level specified in the rule is in 
the general range which a normal person has and the age 
range is 39–56 years. With this attribute combination the 
overall conclusion that can be made is, females in between 
39 and 56 years old who are having normal range of sodium 
level and low cholesterol level in the blood are having a 
higher probability of getting Diabetes type 2.  
Most important thing discovered from this rule is that, a 
relationship exists between gender female and the Diabetes 
type 2.The rule which indicates the direct relationship 
between gender female and the Diabetes type 2 also has a 
confidence level of 0.94. The rule is given below. 
gender=F  ==> diabetesType=Type 2    conf:(0.94) 
Generally the doctors’ belief is that, there is no special 
relationship exists between gender and diabetes. But with the 
above mentioned rules it is possible to say that there is a high 
possibility of occurring Diabetes in females.  
B. Association rules generation- for Diabetes type 1 
The three rules described in section A are based on 
Diabetes type 2. In the medical field and also from the 
doctors’ point of view it is true that most of the Diabetes 
patients are suffered from type 2 diabetes.  According to 
National Diabetes statistics 2007, in adults, type 2 Diabetes 
accounts for about 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of 
Diabetes and type 1 Diabetes accounts for 5 to 10 percent of 
all diagnosed cases of Diabetes [13].  
Even though a very few amount of type 1 are available in 
the database records, association rules to see the relationship 
of different attributes and type 1 Diabetes also have been 
generated. Following are the results generated from that 
study.  
• Rule no 1: 
age=57_75 gender=F diabetesType=Type1 
cholesterol=<5.17 wheezes=Yes ==> edema=Yes     
conf:(0.97) 
This rule is mostly similar to the rule generated regarding 
type 2, but the confidence level is 0.97. This shows that 
wheezes, low cholesterol level and gender female have 
stronger relationship with Diabetes type 1 than type 2. 
One important consideration is that the age group here is 
57-75 years, which is not similar to the rule of Diabetes type 
2. It is said that Diabetes type 1 usually strikes children and 
young adults, although Diabetes onset may occur at any age 
[8]. Asian pacific Diabetes type2 policy group also has stated 
that Diabetes type 1 mostly occurred for the people who are 
below the age limit of 30 [9]. But, according to the above 
association rule that statement can be considered as wrong. 
The below given association rule also can be used to prove 
that most of the older people have got Diabetes type 1 than 
children and young people.  
age=57_75 ==> diabetesType=Type 1    conf:(1) 
The most special finding of the above first rule is the 
relationship between edema and the Diabetes type 1.The 
6
following rule which indicates the direct relationship 
between edema and the Diabetes type 1 also has a 
confidence level of 1, which clearly shows that there is a 
strong relationship between type 1 diabetes and edema.  
diabetesType=Type 1 ==> edema=Yes   conf:(0.95) 
• Rule no 2: 
Gender=F occupation=Housewife Sodium Level=135-
145 diastolic=60-80 cholesterol <5.17 edema = Yes 
diabetesType=Type 1 ==> wheezes=Yes conf :( 0.95) 
With the above attribute combination the overall 
conclusion which can be obtained is that, diabetes patients, 
who are housewives, having edema and low cholesterol 
level, having normal range of sodium diastolic blood 
pressure are the most common people who are having 
wheezes.  
When considering Wheezes; according to the doctors’ 
comments received and literature, there is no any 
relationship between Wheezes and Diabetes. The following 
rule which indicate the relationship between the Wheezes 
and Diabetes type 1 has a confidence level 0.92. It clearly 
shows that there is a strong relationship between Wheezes 
and Diabetes type1.  
 
diabetesType=Type 1 ==> Wheezes=Yes  conf:(0.92) 
So, a clear conclusion can be made that there can be a 
strong relationship between the wheezes and the Diabetes 
type 1 and there is a high probability for the Diabetes 
patients to get Wheezes also. 
• Rule no 3: 
age=39_56 gender=F potassium=2.5-3.6 
cholesterol=<5.17 Sodium Level=135-145 ==> 
diabetesType=Type 1   conf:(1)  
This rule is more similar to the rule no3 of diabetes type 
2. But in this rule a new attribute, “potassium=2.5-3.6”, is 
added. This is the range of low potassium level which should 
be there in the human body. When considering the 
confidence levels in two rules, in the rule of Diabetes type 2 
the confidence level is 0.96 and here the confidence level has 
increased up to 1. This shows that age, gender, low 
cholesterol level, low potassium level and normal range of 
sodium level have much stronger relationship with Diabetes 
type 1 than Diabetes type 2. Also there is more significant 
relationship between Diabetes type 1 and potassium level of 
2.5-3.6. The doctors said that the medical field has already 
found some relationships between high potassium level, high 
sodium level and Diabetes. But when considering this rule a 
decision can be made that there may be no strong 
relationship between those attributes and Diabetes type 1. 
Therefore it can be proved that the major relationship exists 
between gender, age and Diabetes type 1. 
Another important thing we have identified is that 
although some of the risk factors for Diabetes Type 2 are 
identified; still most of the risk factors for Diabetes Type1 
are unknown [14]. The researches which were carried out to 
identify the risk factors for Diabetes Type 1 also have 
identified a small number of risk factors such as family 
history and ethnicity [10]. Therefore, that will be an 
important discovery because; until now most of the risk 
factors for Diabetes type 1 is unknown.  
V. DISCUSSION 
This section contains the comments of the diabetes 
domain experts which were obtained through interviews as 
well as the key contributions of the research towards the 
diabetes field and research community. 
 
A. Comments from domain experts 
Several domain experts such as physicians, nurses and 
medical students were interviewed.  According to the 
comments received, physicians are unaware of a link 
between diabetes patients and those prone to wheezing. 
Diabetes is not considered as a risk factor of wheezing and 
vice versa. But the data mining analysis indicates such a 
relationship and if this is verified through medical 
experiments, then this will be an enhanced contribution 
towards the medical field. 
Physicians and medical students were also unaware of a 
link between gender and diabetes.  The belief is that the 
probability of developing diabetes is equal for both genders 
[6].  If the relationship between gender and diabetes is 
verified through medical experiments, this too will be a 
positive contribution.  The general public could be educated 
about these discoveries and it would help to reduce the 
number of diabetic cases. 
B. Key contributions of the research 
The Business values of this type of a research can be 
identified from the users by gathering information from 
them. Since Diabetes has become a common and very 
annoying decease, people are very interested with this 
research. The key contribution of this research is to identify 
hidden risk factors of Diabetes and to identify weather there 
are relationships between different combinations of risk 
factors.  
The value of this key contribution can be further 
described focusing different end users such as physicians, 
medical students, and the people who have or who do not 
have Diabetes. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this research, association rules were generated using a 
data set of diabetes patients in order to identify the hidden 
risk factors of diabetes.  Type I and Type 2 diabetes were 
considered and some interesting results were obtained. 
Currently in the medical field, although some research 
has been conducted regarding Type 2 diabetes, it is rare for 
Type 1 diabetes.  With the knowledge gained from this 
research and with guidance from experts in the medical field, 
the following conclusions were made. 
A relationship between edema and diabetes has been 
identified in previous studies.  Through the generated 
association rule regarding edema, a direct relationship 
between these two diseases was identified.  A strong 
relationship was also identified between wheezing and 
diabetes.  This relationship between wheeze and diabetes is 
currently not considered in the medical field. 
In the literature and according to the views of physicians, 
both men and women have an equal probability of 
7
developing diabetes. But through this research it was 
discovered that women were at a higher risk of developing 
the disease.  A strong relationship was identified between 
gender, age and Type 1 diabetes. 
Although all the above discovered relationships were 
evident for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, they were 
stronger for Type 1 diabetes. 
The above results were generated through the data 
mining process and evaluated through the related literature 
and the knowledge of domain experts.  But they have to be 
further validated through medical experiments and real life 
applications.  This is the next stage of this research. 
As only an association rules based analysis of diabetes 
patients was carried out in this phase of the research, the next 
phase will concentrate on a classification based analysis.  
The final goal of the entire research project is to identify 
hidden risk factors of diabetes and the dependencies between 
these risk factors by using association rules and classification 
techniques.
