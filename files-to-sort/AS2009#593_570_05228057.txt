Abstract-Mushrooming of e-business has been at a swift rate
during past decade. In this scenario every day a new e-retailer is
entering the world of e-business thus increasing competition in
the area [I). Any e-retailer would be able to sustain in this neck
to neck competition if he is capable of attracting new customers
along with retaining persistent customers . The data mining
techniques, when implemented on the data available with the
store is capable of understanding interesting patterns in the
transactions made by customers (2) (3). The paper presented
discusses the usage of OLAP and data mining in detecting buying
patterns from the data lying with the log files.
architecture consisting of OLAP server and data base server.
However, accessing data alone is not sufficient rather data
stored in multiple dimensions need to be mined to answer
these queries. Thus OLAP and data mining are accepted to be
integral parts of any decision support system reinforcing each
other thus providing correct results.

For Data Mining some machine assistance is required as
if done manually, users may not have enough time to analyze
data in every dimension and consider all relevant scenario that
may result in generating ambiguous or incorrect results. OLAP
data mining systems are capable of mining the data along
multiple dimensions, finding patterns along dimensions and
considering all relevant scenarios.

III.DATA MINING
Data Mining is a key tool to help make sense of all of the
data and better understand and facilitate electronic commerce,
as it provides hidden information about customers buying
patterns, browsing patterns, usage times and preferences. Web
mining techniques can be applied to understand and analyze
such data, and turning into information that can support a web
enabled electronic business to improve its sales and customer
support [7].
Information regarding browsing and buying patterns of
existing customers can be used to generate customized offers
[8]. Better revelation about navigation patterns of the web
pages by using web mining techniques can lead to
II. DATA WAREHOUSING AND OLAP
While new e-retailers are entering into the business they are
necessitated to have data security and integrity to survive into
this neck to neck competition. Mushrooming into the area
demands for analyzing the data available that is maintained in
data warehouses, a repository of an organization's
electronically stored data that is designed to facilitate mining
the data [6]. Apart from providing a common data model Data
warehouses also facilitate decision support system
applications such as frequent item sets (e.g., items with
maximum sales), sequential patterns (e.g., if an item is
purchased then another item is likely to be purchased in near
future) and association rules (e.g., if a n item is purchased
then probability for purchase of another related item is very
high).
Web history log files can be maintained in form of
multidimensional data where each axis represents a dimension
of the information. Figure 1 represents data mining

I. INTRODUCTION
The evolution of e-business comes with handling various
challenges as retaining the persistent customer base along with
attracting new customers. To achieve the said objective some
policies should be evolved to attract the customers. This paper
discusses the importance of maintaining records of visitors,
buyers and transactions made by buyers [4]; techniques that
can be utilized in doing so and consequent benefits of the same.
In this paper, the methodology of Data mining is discussed [5].
Section 2 discusses the storage of web log files for mining
purpose and OLAP. Section 3 discusses techniques for data
mining in the web log files.

customization for existing customers. Steps in Data Mining
are
Figure 2. Web Usage Mining
A. Mining ofweb usage
Web Usage Mining, commonly termed as Web Log
Mining, is to discover patterns in the browsing and navigation
of Web users. It discovers interesting patterns in Web Logs.
Process of Web Usage Mining is depicted in Figure 2.
B. Frequent Item sets
Web Mining can help in finding Frequent Item Sets
from the web log. This helps in finding items with fewer
sales, which needs to be promoted to increase sale.
C. Pattern Detectionfrom Web Transaction
Patterns can be associative in nature or sequential patterns.
Associations refer to the pattern that if an item A is purchased
then item B is likely to be purchased. Example for association
is vehicle and petrol. Sequential patterns are the patterns in
which if an item is purchased then item B is likely to be
purchased in near future. Contact lens and lens solution are
examples of sequential patterns. All such patterns are to be
generated from the data in web log history available with web
log history. Such association rules help e-business in
developing cross-selling and up-selling strategies.
D. Clustering ofCustomers and Products
Number of users visit e-store site on regular basis out of
which some are mere visitors to the site while others are
promising customers of the e-store. Client browsers hold some
of the very important information in the history files, cookie
files that can further facilitate to analyze and classify data.
These customers can be classified as persistent customers and
just visitors to the e-store, Clustering techniques can be used to
classify the customers among different clusters. Further
persistent customers can be classified on the basis of web
server which they access most of the times, which is going to
help identify customers of particular products or brand [9] [10].
The process is going to help in finding the product that gives
maximum returns to the e-retailer along with finding product
having least sale. Some measures need to be taken to promote
sale of such products either by giving luring schemes or
marketing the product. Sometimes even relocation of such
products on the shopping site or highlighting the product may
help to boom the sale.
Some corrective measures should also be taken to convert
mere visitors into persistent customers of the store. Persistent
customers can be retained by giving them some extra benefits;
where benefits can be monetary or even non-monetary.
E. Applications ofanalyzed data to e- business
Classification of customers into infrequent and persistent
customers helps to customize offers to retain persistent
customers while measures are also taken to convert infrequent
customers into persistent customers. Understanding the
navigational patterns of the customers on the web store may
be used to customize web site so that associated items are put
on same web page. Mining the data may also help in
forecasting sales in the future to estimate the stock.
IV.CONCLUSION
It has been extensively shown in the paper that Web
mining can serve as the backbone of any e-business as it can
be appropriately utilized for the mushrooming of e-business,
To survive this neck to neck competition in e-retailing; it has
become demand of time to take correct action at very right
time. Manual analysis of data may result in producing some
incorrect results therefore discovering and extracting
information from Web documents services need to be
automated. With the inherit nature of Internet, e-businesses are
bound to tackle massive, random and sometimes incomplete
data, so integration of e-business with web mining is
inevitable and this combination is bound to progress.
