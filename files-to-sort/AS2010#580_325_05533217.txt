Abstract—Intelligent evaluation? as an important branch in the 
field of artificial intelligence? is a decision-making process of 
simulating the domain experts to solve complex problems. In this 
paper, we puts forward a kind of intelligent evaluation method 
based on improved Apriori, which can be used to mine different 
levels of association rules and evaluate the teaching quality 
automatically. Firstly, we do some improvement on traditional 
Apriori algorithm due to its shortcomings. Secondly, we describe 
the procedure of the teaching quality evaluation based on such 
improved algorithm. Finally, we give an example and the results 
show that this method is feasible and effective.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, artificial intelligence is one of the frontier 
disciplines in the development of contemporary information 
science and technology, and a host of researchers have paid 
attention to such field. In order to evaluate teaching quality in a 
scientific and justice way, the vast majority of colleges and 
universities have gradually established a series of systems on 
teaching quality evaluation [1]. Some valuable information is 
hidden in the ocean of evaluation data, which will affect the 
level of individual teacher's teaching quality directly or 
indirectly, even the decisions [2, 3]. So how to mine such 
useful knowledge from the huge data and what methods should 
be taken so as to get a better accuracy and more effectiveness? 
Data Mining is the non-trivial process of acquiring 
efficient, innovative, potential and ultimately comprehensible 
knowledge from data warehouse or other information sources 
[4]. The data mining in teaching evaluation is that applying the 
appropriate ways to extract, convert, analyze and process the 
data from the teaching-related database, in order to make 
critical decision [5]. The major mining methods of teaching 
quality evaluation are dynamic prediction ?  association 
analysis and clustering [6]. 
With the purpose of doing teaching evaluation objectively, 
intelligently and accurately, we introduce Apriori algorithm [7] 
presented by Agrawal et al. into the process of teaching quality 
evaluation. In this paper, we propose an intelligent evaluation 
model based on Apriori algorithm, which can be easily applied 
into do evaluation in the domain of adult higher education. 
II. EASE OF USE
A. Problem Analysis 
We can see from the above description of the Apriori 
algorithm that the algorithm exists two major shortcomings: 
1) It needs to repeat scan the database to count: For a 
given candidate set Ck, we can calculate the number of each 
item set through a scan of the database. When scanning to 
encounter the records of the candidate set, the number of the 
candidate set is increased by one. The time complexity of the 
Apriori algorithm is O(?k|Ck|*n*v). Where |Ck| is the number 
of the item set; n is the number of records in the database; v is 
the average volume of each record. We can see that the total 
time and the database capacity required by the calculation of 
the candidate set are proportional to the product of the number 
of all the candidate sets. 
2) It needs to generate a large number of candidate sets: 
In general, generating the n items of the frequency set, the 
number of the different candidate sets is as follows:
12... n
2
n
1
n ?=+++
nnCCC
When the generated Ck is large, the efficiency of the 
algorithm is not satisfactory. These two defects seriously affect 
the performance of the algorithm. In order to improve the 
efficiency of the Apriori algorithm, we will improve it, 
including:  
a) Compress the size of the database and reduce the 
number of scanning the database. 
b) Reduce the number of the candidate sets that can’t be 
the frequent item sets. 
c) Improve the speed of the frequency statistics in the 
data item sets. 
B. Algorithm Improvement 
In the analysis of the Apriori algorithm, we discover that 
the Apriori algorithm needs a great deal of operations to 
determine whether the previous k-1 items are the same and the 
last one item is different in the two k item sets. And many of 
the repeated operation are to generate the same k+1 item sets. 
If we can reduce the number of the implementation times in 
this operation, then we can improve the running efficiency of 
the Apriori algorithm.

Education Research Plan of Guangdong Province (ycx092015).

The thought of the connect-step improvement: when 
generating the k item set by the k-1 item sets, the Lk-1 make 
their own connections. If previous k-2 sets in the two items are 
different, we give up the concatenation of the two item sets 
because the resulting item sets are either repeat or non-
frequent. If the l1and l2 are the item sets of the Lk-1, items are 
ordered by ascend according to its occurrence frequency in the 
database. When executing the connection Lk-1×Lk-1, if l1[k-
2]?l2[k-2], then abandon the connection of the l1 and l2.
Otherwise, generating k item set must be redundant, so that can 
reduce the computational complexity. 
The improvement ideological of the frequent items: 
Between the Lk and Ck, introducing the Lk', when one item has 
been validated that it is not a frequent item set, it will be 
inserted into Lk', but not be deleted. In order to distinguish an 
item set whether it is frequent item sets or non-frequent item 
sets, we introduce the flag bit into the item sets. When it is the 
frequent item set, we use 1, or else use 0. At the same time, the 
verification process and the pruning process also need to be 
modified: when verifying the candidate set Ck, each time, we 
select items from the item set Ck to verify. However, each time, 
we select items from Lk' in the pruning process as the pruning 
conditions and iteratively generate Lk +1'.
When generating Ck and re-scanning the database, and if 
the transaction T is the same as a set of Ck, but its support is 
less than min-support, then the transaction T does not work to 
the right behind of the Ck +1. Meanwhile, in the process to 
generate Ck by Ck +1, if there is a transaction in the database D 
and the number of the item is less than k +1, it is very clear that 
the transaction T don’t need to be re-scanned. 
The specific method is as follows: 
1) Firstly define a class Record, having three members: 
Item (r_item), the item length (r_length), the counter (r_count):
Every time, when we read data from the database, we assign 
the value to the Record object. When reading the first 
transaction T1, we make all the items of the T1 broken down 
into a variety of possible combinations. If the number of the 
combinations is n, then create n objects, the property values of 
the various item (r_item) are the number of the combined item 
r_length.
2) When reading the second T2, the way of the 
decomposition items is the same as the first step. If the number 
of the broken combinations is m, it does not necessarily create 
m objects. But, first of all, we determine whether the newly 
generating combinations are in the created object. If it already 
exists, it will accordingly r_count + +, or creating a new 
object, and completing the initialization. Repeating the second 
step until you read all the T. 
We make use of the above steps to complete the 
improvement of the Apriori algorithm in order to enhance its 
efficiency. 
III. THE MODEL OF INTELLIGENT EVALUATION
Teaching evaluation is based on the certain educational 
principles and policies. We propose the targeted advice process 
of the further improvement and development. Teaching 
evaluation system is the platform that the school leaders and 
managers make use of to master the teaching goals and 
improve the quality of the teaching. Based on the school 
network platform, we make the design method of the teaching 
evaluation system. For the characteristics of the adult higher 
education school database, this paper presents the education 
quality assessment framework based on an improved Apriori 
algorithm. The model consists mainly of data collection, data 
selection, data standardization and rules recommended, as 
shown in Fig. 1. 
Figure 1. The teaching evaluation model based on an improved Apriori 
Algorithm 
A. Data Acquisition 
The goal of the data acquisition is to achieve the integrity 
of the large-scale evaluation data, and accurately to collect the 
data. Teaching quality analysis and evaluation system uses the 
computer's data conversion function to directly open source 
database for data collection. We integrate the various types of 
data from transaction-oriented real-time operation database to 
data warehouse based on the data mining analysis, mainly 
including the students' evaluation information, teacher 
information, evaluation criteria and class teachers' instructor 
information integration. 
B. Data Preprocessing 
Data cleaning usually consists of the inconsistent data 
processing, the vacancy value padding, the data conversion and 
so on. The inconsistent data and noise data processing in the 
system has been completed in the information initial module. 
Here, we focus on resolving the vacancy value padding and 
data transformation. As the Apriori algorithm is applied to the 
data mining in the transaction database, it needs to convert the 
data of the teaching information table to the corresponding 
transaction table to provide data mining objects for the entire 
data mining module.  
Through the above pre-processing operation, the system has 
a complete, clean, and suitable for data mining output to ensure 
the follow-up data mining producing useful rules. 
C. Data Normalization 
Data normalization ensures that the pre-processing data can 
be transformed into the unified standard data. It is the premise 
to carry out the rule mining. Pros and cons of the data in this 
step will directly affect the results of the association rule 
mining. Teaching quality assessment data is a numeric type 
data. So it requires the dispersion processing to the continuous 
standard data sets. Through the discrete processing, we get the 
standard data sets suitable for the algorithms to make the 
association rule mining. For example, the evaluation data is 
divided into five levels: H1 ~ [0-60], H2 ~ [61-70], H3 ~ [71-
80], H4 ~ [81-90], H5 ~ [91-100]. 
D. Rule generation 
We will apply the improved Apriori algorithm to the 
method which mainly includes the following steps: 
1) Generating the transaction database: We extract the 
property from the teachers’ archive database. And we merge it 
with the students' assessment results to group a table. That 
provides data mining objects for the entire data mining module. 
As the Apriori algorithm is fit for the data mining of the 
transaction database, it needs to convert the corresponding 
relationship table to the transaction database. 
The field values in the record are converted to the 
corresponding project using the code table. We make use of the 
data mining technology to analysis the collected evaluation 
data. We try to discover useful knowledge hidden in the data 
and extract the useful knowledge for the schools and teachers. 
2) We introduce the improved Apriori algorithm in the 2.2 
part to the rule mining process: mainly including the 
transactional data connections, as well as the frequent item set 
pruning, trying to find the largest item set.
3) After generating the frequent item sets, and for any 
frequent k item sets, we find out all possible subset as the 
antecedent of association rules based on the given association 
rule algorithm: We calculate the confidence of the 
corresponding rules. When the confidence degree of a rule is 
greater than the minimum confidence level, it output that rule. 
Once finding the frequent item sets from the transaction in 
the database D, we can directly generate the strong association 
rules (strong association rules satisfy the minimum support 
degrees and minimum confidence degrees). 
E. Recommended Rules 
Recommended rules refer to recommending the excavated 
usefulness association rules to the user, and can accept the 
user's evaluation. This includes the parsing steps of the rule. It 
is the display section of the result information. In order to 
allow users to more intuitively understand the extracted 
knowledge, we will usually visualize the resulting information 
and return the results to the user. 
IV. CASE STUDY
In order to prove the correctness and effectiveness of the 
model proposed in this paper, this section will validate the 
method through a real-life example. The goal of this test is to 
mine and analysis the evaluated data information based on the 
existing quality of education in order to provide basis of 
decision-making for improving the teaching quality of teachers 
and the school's overall standard of teaching. 
A. Data collection and data cleaning 
Based on resources needs in system analysis, we collect the 
personal basic conditions data of 696 teachers in school, and 
the teaching quality assessment data to 696 teachers of 2478 
students and other assessment data in second semester of the 
2008-2009 school year. As the data has been made 
requirements when inputting, there is no empty data and dirty 
data, so no need doing special cleaning treatment. 
As affected by different factors, different survey objects 
share different weight in teaching quality evaluation grades, so 
that the different survey objects have various weighting in 
teachers teaching quality assessment, as shown in Table 1. 
TABLE I. ASSESSMENT WEIGHT

Weight 0.5 0.3 0.2 
Evaluation methods can be divided into qualitative 
assessment and quantitative evaluation. Due to the position of 
every evaluation index that is different in teaching quality, 
therefore, every index shares the different weight when 
comprehensively assessing the teaching quality, as shown in 
table 2. Table 3 shows the teachers' score calculated by the 
parameters from Table 1 and Table 2.

B. Data Discretization  
In the table of teachers status and the table of teaching 
quality assessment, few of data (such as age) are the same in 
exactly, if mining the data directly, the test will not get the 
desired result meeting the degree of support and confidence, so 
data in the table must be transformed, and combined the same 
or similar attribute values into a single attribute value in order 
to satisfy the degree of support and confidence. Specific data 
transformation rules are as follows: 
1) Age discretization, the transforming age of data is 
divided into 6 grades as follows: 
A: [0-30]. B: [31-35]. C: [36-40]. D: [41-45]. E: [46-50]. F: 
[51- +?]. 
2) Teaching attitude discretization, transforming teaching 
attitude into four grades. 
A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20]. 
3) Teaching method discretization, transforming teaching 
content into four grades. 
A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20]. 
4) Teaching level, discrete data will soon be teaching 
methods of data transformation for the four grades of data. 
A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20]. 
5) The effect of data discretization of the teaching is about 
teaching efficacy data transformation for the four grades of 
data. 
A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20]. 
6) Language discretization of the teaching is 
transformation for the four grades of data. 
A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20]. 
C. Rules Mining 
By using the method described in section 3, scanning the 
data set D to find the candidate set of data items C1 by Apriori 
algorithm, and obtain frequent item sets L1 by the minimum 
support, generate candidate data item sets C2 from the L1 by 
algorithm, then get the frequent data item sets L2 by the 
minimum degree of support, at last, can get the whole frequent 
data items sets. Set minimum support degree as 15%, minimum 
confidence level as 15%, the evaluation score>=80. Some parts 
of the results are given in Table 4.

D. Rules Analysis 
Table 4 shows that the preliminary data show that 
association rules, for example: the possibility of the age of 
range A, and the evaluation score>=80 is 45.3%, support rate 
was 21.1%. These rules show that high academic and title 
young teachers have rich teaching experience and a high 
degree of confidence, the quality of teaching has been well 
received. According to the preliminary association rules, the 
intrinsic relationship of some properties can be found, such as: 
the relationship among teaching effectiveness, age, job title and 
education.  
It can be also found that the teachers with title of associate 
professor and master's degree education have higher research 
levels, wider range of knowledge and a high level of teaching 
quality. The teachers with better teaching attitudes and teaching 
methods have better level of teaching quality. It indicates that: 
when taking efforts to improve the operational capacity, the 
professional accomplishment also should be improved. 
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we suggested a model of teaching quality 
evaluation based on a refined Apriori algorithm, including its 
analyzing, design and implementation. We described the data 
acquirement and preprocessing of how to obtain a useful 
teaching evaluation data and created an appropriate database 
for mining. Using the improved Apriori-based algorithm, we 
established a way of mining some valuable knowledge from 
the database abovementioned, aiming at finding the most 
influence factors of the teachers' teaching and providing 
decision support to improve and enhance teaching quality. 
Through the improved algorithm, we can get a better mining 
results and more effectiveness, achieve do teaching evaluation 
quality in combination with technologies in data mining.
