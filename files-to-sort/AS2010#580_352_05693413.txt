Abstract—An important problem that arises during the data 
mining process in many new emerging application domains is 
mining data with temporal dependencies. One such application 
domain is activity discovery and recognition. Activity discovery 
and recognition is used in many real world systems, such as 
assisted living and security systems, and it has been vastly studied 
in recent years.  However, the temporal features and relations 
which provide useful insights for activity models have not been 
exploited to their full potential by mining algorithms. In this 
paper, we propose a temporal model for discovering temporal 
features and relations of activity patterns from sensor data. Our 
algorithm is able to discover features and relations, such as the 
order of the activities, their usual start times and durations by 
using rule mining and clustering techniques. The algorithm has 
been validated using 4 months of data collected in a smart home.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Activity discovery and recognition has been recently 
utilized in many different application domains, such as security 
and health monitoring of elder adults. Health monitoring of 
elder adults based on using assistive technologies such as smart 
homes, has attracted many researchers in recent years due to 
the increasing aging population. An estimated 9% of adults 
over age 65 and 50% of adults over age 85 need assistance with 
their everyday activities.  The resulting cost is significant both 
for the government and for families. To function independently 
at home, elderly people need to be able to complete the 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) [1] such as taking 
medication, cooking, eating and sleeping. 
Assistive technologies such as smart homes can greatly 
help in monitoring the activities of elder adults at home. By 
using a large number of different types of sensors deployed in 
an everyday setting, and using techniques from activity 
discovery and recognition, smart homes are able to discover 
and recognize patterns of resident activities.  
Activity discovery and recognition has been vastly studied 
in the context of smart environments [2], [3], [4] and [6]. 
Despite the increasing progress in this area, a key component in 
these activities, namely temporal features and relations, has 
been largely ignored. One of the few works in this area by 
Rashidi and Cook [5] provides a method for discovering and 
representing basic temporal features of the activities, such as 
the usual start times at multiple granularities. However, they do 
not address discovering other temporal features and relations, 
such as the relative order of the activities. Discovering the 
order of the activities can be of great use in many different 
scenarios, such as for predicting the next activity in an activity 
reminder application or a home automation system. 
In this paper, we provide a framework for discovering and 
representing the temporal features of activity patterns. Our 
framework called “DTFRA” (short for Discovering of 
Temporal Features and Relation of Activities), discovers the 
usual start times of the activity patterns in form of a normal 
mixture distribution [7], using a k-means clustering technique 
[8]. DTFRA discovers a similar representation for duration of 
activities using a normal mixture distribution. We also discover 
the order of activities using temporal association rule mining 
techniques. 
The temporal information that is discovered by our 
algorithms can be beneficial in many different applications. 
Here we mention just a few such applications: 
- Reminder systems: The discovered temporal 
information can be used to construct a schedule of 
activities for an upcoming period. Such a schedule is 
constructed based on the predicted start time intervals, 
as well as the relative order of the activities. For 
example, it can be used as part of an activity reminder 
system for an Alzheimer patient, in order to 
automatically generate prompts to remind the patient to 
initiate activities, if s/he does not follow the usual 
schedule within the expected start times. 
- Anomaly detection: Discovering a confidence level for 
the order relations, as well as finding the typical start 
times and durations as mixture models allow us to 
assign a probability to a particular activity occurring in 
a given interval. Using the assigned probabilities and 
using the anomaly detection methods [9], one can 
exploit such information to detect the any anomalous 
or suspicious activities.  
- Context aware system networks: Last but not least, 
such information can be used in designing an activity-
aware wireless sensor network. Activity aware sensor 
networks aim to augment wireless sensor network with

context awareness by taking advantage of the 
behavioral pattern information such as temporal 
information. Temporal information allow the sensor 
networks to act more intelligently by determining 
which sensors need to be awake at any given time, in 
order to route data more efficiently with respected to 
the predicted activities within a given time period. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First we will 
describe the related works. Next we will explain our model in 
more detail, followed by the results of our experiments on the 
data obtained from an elderly smart apartment. Finally we end 
the paper with conclusions. 
II. RELATED WORK 
In recent years, the data mining community has observed 
remarkable progress in discovering association rules from 
transactional data. The notion of association rules was first 
proposed by Agrawal et al. [10] to capture the co-occurrence of 
items in transaction events. Because a transaction typically 
includes a timestamp as well as the transaction items, an 
interesting extension to the concept of association rule is to 
augment it with the time dimension. This extension suggests 
that we may discover different rules when different time 
intervals are considered. As a result, some rules may hold 
during some time intervals, while not during the others. When 
we consider the association rules augmented by their temporal 
intervals, we refer to them as temporal association rules [11]. 
Activity patterns in smart environments also include a 
timestamp. The timestamp indicates when a particular activity 
has occurred, or more specifically when a specific sensor was 
triggered. Just like the association rule mining, adding the 
concept of temporal features to the activity patterns can be 
quite useful, and in some cases necessary. For example, in a 
home automation system, the concept of time needs to be taken 
into account to anticipate the time when activities should or 
would occur. Despite the potential use of temporal features in 
activity patterns, this key aspect has usually been ignored and it 
has not been exploited to its full potential. Gottfried et al. [12] 
mention that reasoning about time and space in smart homes is 
necessary, because certain things have to be done at certain 
times and places, and in association with other contexts. Our 
study goes beyond just highlighting the importance of using 
temporal features. Here we present a framework to discover 
and present the temporal features of activities by inferring 
temporal association rules among different activities. As 
another related work, Rashidi and Cook [5] have suggested a 
method for discovering and representing temporal features of 
the activities. They propose a method for presenting the usual 
start times of the activities. However they do not consider other 
temporal features and relations, such as the order of the 
activities. Galushka et al. [13] also discuss the importance of 
temporal features for learning activity patterns; however, they 
do not exploit such features for learning activity patterns in 
practice. Jakkula and Cook [14] show the benefit of 
considering temporal associations for activity prediction. Their 
main focus is on investigating methods based on using Allen’s 
temporal logic [15, 16] to analyze smart home data, and to use 
such analysis for event prediction. 
In the framework presented in this paper, we will provide a 
method for discovering various temporal features, and we will 
present and discuss the results of applying our methods to a 
real smart home dataset. 
III. MODEL DESCRIPTION 
The architecture of our model called DTFRA is illustrated 
in Fig. 1. It consists of two main components: temporal feature 
discovery, and temporal relation discovery. Each component 
will be described in more detail in the following subsections. 
 
Figure 1.  DTFRA architecture. 
The input to DTFRA is an activity pattern dataset, and its 
output is a set of temporal relation rules. To make it easier to 
follow the description of our model, we will consider the 
“taking medication” activity as an example throughout our 
discussions. More activities will be discussed in the 
Experimental Results section. 
A. Activity Pattern Dataset 
The input dataset consists of a set of individual sensor 
events collected from various sensors deployed in the space. 
Each sensor event consists of a sensor ID and a timestamp

B. Temporal Activity Features Discovery 
In this study, we consider two temporal features for every 
activity: the start time of the activity and the duration of the 
activity. For this purpose, we extract the start times of every 
activity instance, and then we cluster the start times to obtain a 
canonical representation for the start time of a specific activity. 
Here we use the k-means clustering algorithm to construct a 
mixture model for each activity ai. If we denote the start time 
of an activity instance ai as ti, then the probability that ti 
belongs to a certain cluster k with parameters ?? = (?, ?), can

I. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented DTFRA for discovering 
temporal features and relations of activity patterns. Our 
algorithm is able to discover features and relations, such as the 
order of the activities, their usual start times and durations by 
using rule mining and clustering techniques. These discoveries 
can be used in many applications, such as developing activity 
reminder and anomaly detection systems, as well as designing 
activity-aware wireless sensor networks.
