Abstract—Hailstone is one of main meteorological disasters and it 
is difficult to forecast effectively. In this paper, a new hail echo 
detection method based on time series association rules was 
proposed and a hail echo automatic detection system was built. 
Compared to the existing methods, the test results have shown 
that this method eliminated hail alert failure completely and also 
reduced the proportion of false alarm, raising the accuracy of 
hail forecast. The system was able to assist forecasters to make 
correct hail forecasts and provide reference to other disastrous 
weather forecast.

I. INTRODUCTION 
At present, the detection, identification and application of 
the hail clouds include the following two aspects [1-2]: (1) the 
accurate detection of the hail cloud by collecting much more 
particle information using Doppler radar. This typed method 
include the radar echo pattern detection, radar echo parameter 
detection and hailstone detection based on mutual information 
network model, etc. (2) The application of cloud model. This is 
a validity check method which explores the early features of 
the hail cloud by using observation accompanied by numerical 
simulation, such as the optical information detection, energy 
analysis method and GMS real-time data detection, etc. The 
cloud model is not high accurate in detecting the hail cloud, 
while the application of the radar echo data can greatly improve 
the accuracy. However, there still exists alert failure and false 
alarm and the hail forecast is not satisfactory.  
Based on the time series database of the hail features, a hail 
echo detection method with time series association rules is 
proposed. By applying the objective and effective association 
rules which are obtained from FP-tree data mining to identify 
and classify the hail echoes, the alert failure is eliminated 
completely and the false alarm is reduced. The effectiveness of 
this method is validated using the test results.  
II. SYSTEM FRAMEWORK 
Fig.1 shows the whole framework of the hail echo detection 
system based on the time series association rules. 
The following subsections mainly introduce the formation 
of the time series database, hail echo detection and forecast. 
The technical issues related to the system framework can be 
referred to [3].

III. TIME SERIES RULES DATABASE  
A. Construction of Time Series Database[3-5]  
Generally, a process described by time series is a 
combination of long-term trend changes, seasonal variations, 
periodic variations irregular changes and so on change factors. 
However not all processes contain these four variations. For 
the hail echo problem, its time series variable Y describing the 
characteristics of radar images is a function of time t, namely 
Y = F(t). Time series demonstrates some characteristics 
varying with time by using the time series charts. The curves 
in Fig.2 describe the hail echo developing process (including 
generating period, developing period, hailing period and dying 
period).  
The 4 curves in Figure 1, 2, 3, 4 express the characteristic 
quantity ——entropy variety process in 4 hails respectively. 
The time series database mainly included the following three 
parts of attributes: 
a) Static attribute: Radar image information included the 
imaging time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second), radar 
product number, elevation and so on. This unique ID could be 
used for queries, updates of the image database. 
b) Application attribute: Radar image features database, 
including the typical hail echo monomers and other 
disturbance cloud’s intensity features, texture features, shape 
features and comparison before and after, etc, was the main 
raw data for data mining.

c) Statistical attribute: Weather condition description 
corresponding to the current image. For example whether hail 
or not and the hail state. 
The above attributes were input attributes, correspondingly 
whether is going to hail was taken as the objective attribute. 
Attribute features in the time series feature database 
included: Average gray, Correlation, Energy, Entropy, Inertia, 
Local calm, Grads uniformity and the other more than ten 
kinds of features. 
B. Kmowledge Discoverry Based on Time Series Database—
—Time Serises Association Rules Data Mining[6-8] 
1) Frequent Pattern Tree——FP-tree 
Frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) shown in Fig.3 was 
defined as following: 
• It consisted of one root node marked as "null" and a 
series of frequent item nodes, as well as a frequent item 
header table. Items in the table should meet the 
minimum support. 
• In addition to root node, each node in the tree 
contained three fields: item name, count and node link. 
Item name referred to the item represented by the node; 
count was used to record the number of things passed 
through the node; node link pointed to the next node 
which had the same item name, as shown in the figure. 
When the dotted arrows had not a next node, its pointer 
was empty. 
• Frequent item table was composed of three parts: item 
name, count and head of node link. Head of node link 
was a pointer which pointed to the first node with the 
same item name in the node chain. 
Figure 3.  FP-tree examplet 
FP-tree data mining was realized by FP-growth algorithm. 
Firstly the condition pattern base was constructed from the 
frequent itemset whose length is 1. Then the condition FP-tree 
is built by the condition pattern base and recursively mining 
was performed on the FP-tree until the condition FP-tree only 
contained one single path. Finally the frequent itemset 
information could be obtained. 
2) Effective Rules Generation 
By mining the FP-tree data mining the frequent itemsets 
could be obtained and then the strong association rules could 
be generated if the confidence of the rule is greater than a 
given threshold value min_conf. The confidence calculating 
formula is: 
support _ ( )( ) ( | )
support _ ( )
count A Bconfidence A B P A B
count A
?? = = , 
where the support_count?A?B?is the number of things 
which contain item set A?B, support_count?A? is the 
number of things which contain itemset A. The generation 
process of strong association rules was as follows: 
• For each frequent itemset L, generate all non-empty 
subset. 
• For each non-empty subset S of L, if 
                    support _ ( ) min_
support _ ( )
count L conf
count S
? , 
then output rule “S? (L?S)”. 
The output rule's form is: If S (union input attribute) then 
L-S (target attribute). 
Based on the time series feature database constructed by  
14 hails’ Doppler radar samples provided by a city’s weather 
bureau (as shown in Fig. 4), the time series repository 
generated is shown in Tab.?. 
For the meaning of rule No. 1: If Inertia= (0.393157, 
1.374235) then HaiState =0, conf=1?that is, when the Inertia 
value was in (0.393157, 1.374235), the echo monomer was in 
the hail generating period and its confidence was 1.   
For the meaning of rule No. 7: If Energy= (0.028399, 
0.206661) then HaiState =2, conf=1?that is, when the Energy 
value was in (0.028399, 0.206661), the echo monomer was in 
the hailing period and its confidence was 1.

IV. INFERENCE 
A. Rule Activation 
If the features data in time series database matched the 
condition part of time series repository the rule was activated. 
Activated rule was not necessarily used, because there may be 
several rules’ condition part matched. In such a case the 
conflict management was used to choose between them. 
B. Conflict Management 
Because the rules were consist of input attributes and 
possible objective attributes, there may be a few rules which 
had the same conditions while the decision part was not 
completely the same. This indicated that conflicts existed in 
these rules. The solution was: 
• Found out the conflict rules. Selected the rules which 
had the most joint attributes first. 
• For the rules having the same joint attributes, selected 
the rule which had the max confidence and ignored the 
other rules. 
V. EXPERIMENT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
A. Hail Echo Detection and Forecast 
Use the rules generated by FP-tree mining algorithm to 
identify radar images and classify hail echoes. The whole 
detection and forecast process are as follows: 
a) Image pre-processing: Removed radar image’ text 
information and geography information color and then 
converted the radar image to gray image. 
b) Image segmentation and filtering: Selected echo 
area with reflectance value 40 dbz above and pixel number 
no less than 500 in radar images (the threshold value was 
set under the instruction of experienced meteorologist). 
 
 
c) Feature extraction: Used black rectangle to mark 
connected domains, calculate color, texture and shape features 
of each echo connected domain, and stored the features in time 
series database. 
d) Hail echo classification: With the feature data in time 
series database (including time stamp), applied the rules we 
obtained to classify hail echoes, including hail generating, 
developing, hailing and dying four periods. 
e) Detection and forecast: According to the classification 
result, marked out hail echoes in radar echo images. The white 
rectangle represents the hail generating period, the brown 
represents the developing and hailing period and the black 
represents the hail dying period. 
B. Test Resulsts and Analysis

Using the hail echo detection system we constructed based 
on time series association rules, total 1851 monomers of 
history large and slight hails in the year of 2005 and 2006 
provided by a city weather bureau was tested. Compared with 
the detection method based on mutual information network 
model, the test results are shown in Tab.?. To the 44 time 
recorded hail processes, the time advance was tested. The 
results are shown in Tab.?.   
The statistical results of Tab.? show that: this method 
eliminated hail alert failure completely and also reduced the 
proportion of false alarm, raising the accuracy of forecast. 
Tab.? indicated that this method was slightly better than the 
existing methods and is to be further improved. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
• In this paper, the image mining technique has been 
used to excavate the potential rules (objective model) 
of hail weather, realize the hail echo automatic 
detection based on time series association rules for the 
first time. 
• A hail echo automatic detection system has been built. 
Compared to existing method, it has eliminated hail 
alert failure completely, reduced the proportion of false 
alarm and raised the accuracy of forecast. This method 
is feasible to assist forecasters to make correct hail 
forecasts. 
• The method has also achieved a good result on hail 
forecast and met the basic requirement of practical 
applications. 
It is a challenging and promising work in the paper not 
only to obtain the hail echo automatic detection method, but 
also to provide reference to other disastrous weather forecast.
