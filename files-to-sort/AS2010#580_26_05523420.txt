Abstract—Based on the daily operation data of the urban road 
traffic management system, this paper analysis the demand of 
data mining of the traffic violations, pre-processes the data to 
data sets by the detection methods of proximity-based outlier. 
According to the characteristics of data traffic offense, 
combining the advantages of rough sets and association rules 
data mining, proposed two methods based on the joint data 
mining method. Finally, a city in the year 2008 road traffic 
management data, for example, using the text method, 
regularity of the traffic offense causes were analyzed, 
indicating that the method is effective.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
With the rapid development of ITS, digital road traffic 
management becomes an inevitable trend. For the road 
traffic management sector, the completion of different 
functions in the development of the traffic management 
system, the face of the accumulated large amounts of data, a 
simple query and modify data, all of these relying on 
intuition for decision-makers traffic management decision-
making, has failed to meet the demand, need to adopt data 
mining analysis found that the potential relationship between 
the data.[1-2]  
Data mining technology has been studied and applied in 
the field of traffic management. In road traffic management, 
mainly at the theoretical level, the study will address the data 
transport features of database systems, traffic management 
and data mining platform, system framework and design; in 
traffic accidents cause analysis, mainly for rough set theory 
[3-4], association rules, and gray system approach to a specific 
application. 
 
II. DATA PREPROCESSING BASED ON ANOMALY 
DETECTION  
A. Database of data mining  
Faced with increasingly rapid growth of traffic 
management data, internal traffic management departments 
of many cities has integrated constructed the traffic 
management data: completed the traffic police law system, 
penalties for traffic police off-site system, traffic police 
incident processing system, traffic police driving them the 
data management systems, etc.[5] real-time information 
automatically collected, and built a centralized repository to 
access the data center consolidation, with the data for the 
comprehensive utilization of the operational data base. This 
paper studies have relied on data sheet for the driver database, 
illegal motor vehicles off-site databases, and the driver on-
site law database. 
B. The demand of data mining for traffic violate  
Through the analysis of historical data, use the 
management of vehicles and drivers to provide relevant 
statistical data for the relevant departments of the vehicle, the 
driver management of digital information as an auxiliary. 
The following are the major elements: 
?1?the analysis of traffic violate type 
Analysis the historical data on traffic models, time, 
location type to reflect the traffic violate and accident 
statistics in different situations, auxiliary reflect the vehicle 
driving characteristics and mechanical properties for vehicle 
management vetting and traffic management to provide 
supplementary support in order to improve management. 
?2?analysis the composition of the traffic violated 
people 
Analysis the driver's age, driving experience, gender, 
type of work and other information in order to statistically 
analysis the illegal the time, location type, type of driving a 
vehicle in different situations, reflecting the driver's share of 
various types of illegal incidents, auxiliary driver training to 
provide targeted learning content, and determine the 
corresponding transport publicity strategies and promotional 
focus. 
?3?comparative analysis between traffic accidents and 
weather, time, road type 
Illegal types of traffic analysis of historical data to reflect 
the kinds of cases, the traffic offense type as shown in the 
weight-assisted driver training. 
?4?analysis the situation of traffic violate and driver 
Illegal types of traffic analysis of historical data to reflect 
the kinds of cases that the account of the drivers’ specific 
physical and psychological situation (drinking, tired, illness, 
happiness, sadness). 
C. Anomaly detection theory  
In the traffic management data analysis, the pros and 
cons of the data quality has a direct impact on the deep-level 
mining, data preprocessing is an indispensable process[6,7,8].

The data pre-processing techniques generally include data 
cleansing, data filling, data integration, data conversion of 
several main parts. Anomaly detection theory commonly 
used statistical methods, based on proximity outlier detection, 
detection based on clustering technology. In this paper, based 
on proximity outlier detection methods, which can solve the 
statistical distribution model to bring the satisfaction of the 
restrictions, while easy to use, when an object far away from 
most of the points when the object is the exception. Specific 
principles are as follows: 
You can use the k-nearest neighbor distance to measure 
an object is far away from most of the points, that is, an 
object of the outlier points to its score from the k-nearest 
neighbor distance is given. Outliers’ scores highly sensitive 
to the values of k, if k is too small, then the small number of 
adjacent outliers may lead to lower scores. If k is too large 
then the points is less than k clusters in all the objects may 
have become outliers. Algorithm operation is generally the 
first, depending on the application, delete non-relevant 
attributes, to identify key attributes. Then from the distance, 
the density or characteristics to determine the other points 
away from the isolation, from the dissimilarity of data to 
determine differences between different points and thus 
determine the outliers. Finally, key properties into a matrix, 
according to above-average dissimilarity of the outliers of 
the size of the order, ahead of the front and the final score a 
few points, the largest and the possibility of becoming the 
biggest outliers. 
D. the example of data pre-processing 
Based on data from routine traffic management in 2008 
full year of a city, in order from the time dimension analysis 
of the efficiency of traffic management staff and abnormal 
conditions, according to two data sets already in the field 
through data preprocessing, get 10 export fields. Licensing 
moment, driving permit issued moment of registration 
certificate issued moment, certificate of compliance time, 
update time and its relationship with the initial time interval 
between the date of registration in order to improve 
efficiency of operation and does not break the law for the 
original data, from the total sample randomly selected from 
4916 records exception tests the final test results shown in 
Figure 1. 
We can see from the figure recorded in 4916, find 49 
found abnormal records, abnormal records will be divided 
into two groups, Group 1 found 12 records, the second group 
found 37 records, the details of each group as shown in 
Figure 2.

III. DATA MINING MODEL BASED ON ROUGH SETS AND 
ASSOCIATION RULES 
A. rough sets theory  
Rough set theory can in the absence of a priori 
knowledge and without any prior knowledge of the data or 
subjective assessment of the condition, using only the 
information contained in the data itself, analyze objectively 
and effectively and deal with imprecise, uncertain and 
incomplete data, and discovered implicit knowledge, reveal 
the law of the potential. 
Using rough set theory for decision analysis, that is, from 
a given data set to obtain usable information, from the rough 
set model built up in raw data, through data compression, 
reduction, the importance of attribute analysis methods to 
can generate a reasonable decision-making program. 
Rough set theory is given to discuss property-dependent 
methods. Suppose S = (U?A?F) is information system, 
, if , The attribute set B is called depends 
on the attribute set C, this is C . If C B  
and . The attribute set B is called with the attribute 
set C is equivalent. If the attribute set Q depends on the 
attribute set P, in the information system, Q derived from the 
attribute set of knowledge is superfluous. In this situation, 
and P provide the same knowledge (object features). 
Sometimes, the dependences of attribute set is partly, it 
means that the only part of the knowledge derived from the 
set Q were determined the knowledge of set P, this part of 
the relationship can be derived from the knowledge of the 
relationship between the positive domain to characterize. 
,B C A? CR R? B
B? ?
B C?
P Q
In decision-making table, different attributes may have 
different importance. For example, when the symptoms 
described by the patient's situation, It is significant to 
identify the physical condition of some of the symptoms the 
patient In order to determine a property of importance in the 
system, you can remove this attribute from the table, after the 
systematic classification , how kind of changes will occur 
considering without this property. If remove the 
corresponding classification of the property changed greatly, 
then the property in the system is more important, otherwise, 
the property is not very important. 
B.  Association Rules theory 
Data mining association rules is a typical method, a large 
number of traffic accidents can be studied in the correlation 
between different events, if the two events appear in the 
same time, they think that they are closely related; probably 
one of the incident was caused by another event.  
Agrawal in 1993 first proposed an association theory 
mining customer transaction database item set association 
rules and designed a basic algorithm, the core is a recursive 
method based on the frequency of set theory. 
(1) The basic idea of Algorithm 
The basic idea of Algorithm is, first, identify all the 
frequent sets, and then set the frequency generated by the 
strong association rules. 
(2) Core description of the algorithm Apriori 
Algorithm Apriori was put forward in 1994, the basic 
idea is scan the database repeat. A brief description of its 
core programs are as follows, 
L1 = { large 1 - itemsets}; 
for ( k = 2; Lk - 1 ?<; k ++ ) do begin 
Ck = apriori_gen (Lk - 1 ) ; the new candidate set?  
for all transactions t D do begin?  
Ct = subset (Ck , t) ; the can? didate set of t is included 
in t do 
for all candidates c Ct?  
c. count ++ ; 
end 
Lk = { c Ck | c.count? minsup}?  
end 
Answer = k
k
L  
C.  conjoint analyses based on rough sets and Association 
Rules
The above-mentioned two kinds of traffic data mining, 
although it can analysis the causes of traffic violations and 
regularity from a different perspective, methods have their 
own characteristics, can not independently accomplish the 
cause of mining traffic comprehensive, multi-angled and 
multi-level mining traffic offense and regularity of the task. 
In this paper, two kinds of single-edge mining technology 
proposed data analysis model of rough set - Association 
Rules, the basic procedure is, first, the use of rough set 
theory and method of analysis of the information contained 
in the Road Traffic violations in which information elements 
are most likely to affect the production of traffic violations, 
this is, which factor in a closer relationship with the traffic 
offense, and according to an important degree of factor 
weights to sort; Secondly, the use of association rules mining 
method in the top few elements of what kind of state were 
more likely to lead to the occurrence of traffic violations. 
Specific analysis process was shown in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3.  Mining Analysis Process 
D. Statistical analysis of the traffic offenses 
Based on traffic violate data regularly in the whole year 
of 2008, take violate behavior as decision attribute, take 
month and week ordinal of violate, code of vehicle type, date, 
plate type code, week and moment of violate as condition 
attribute, use the method of rough sets theory to get the 
weight of condition attribute showing in figure 6-3. Select 
the previous five condition attributes the analysis of 
association rules as condition attributes. The analysis results 
of principles of association rules are shown in Figure 4.
