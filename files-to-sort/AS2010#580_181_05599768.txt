?. INTRODUCTION
Multi-target track processing system based on the infrared 
sensor array is a key component of ship-borne infrared early 
warning system. Its main function is to achieve target file 
generated, target tracking and track management of multi-
target. Bearing-only tracking with a single station is high 
nonlinear in substance. For the certain constraints of target 
observability, real-time and hidden feature, traditional 
algorithms are difficult to perform well. As yet, resolving 
method of this issue has been difficult in maneuvering target 
tracking domain [1-5]. In reference [6-9], some target tracking 
approaches are presented directly based on bearing-only 
measurements in polar plane on the assumption that bearing-
only target movement is linear. The base of the assumption is 
that sampling time of passive sensor is shorter and target 
confirming accuracy is high enough. There is always an 
application example with JPDA-IMM algorithm in reference [6, 
7]. But, some key problems still exist in engineering 
application. And the stability of this fusion strategy needs to be 
further improved.  In order to track the target with a large range, 
the bearing-only measurements will be obtained by 
constructing infrared sensor array. This sensor system imitates 
compound eye of insect where every infrared sensor is a small 
eye in a single passive sensor system. Based on this sensor 
system, by deep analysis of simulation and engineering

application, some problems are caused by inherent properties 
of algorithm. Others are caused by direct bearing-only 
application of traditional algorithm. This paper gives some 
solution to these problems based on JPDA-IMM. Moreover, an 
adaptive track management approach will be presented in this 
paper.

JPDA[10-12] is advancing extending algorithm from 
PDA[13] (Probabilistic Data Association). It resolves the bug

always is considered as one of the most perfect association 
approach. The key technology of this bearing-only algorithm 
application [6] is listed as follows:

If and only if the target measurement involves in the target

2)   Clustering matrix  
If consider that clustering matrix (or confirmed matrix) 
have km rows and N?1 lines, clustering is defined as the most 
aggregate of conjoint tracking gate. All of targets are divided 
into different groups according to different clustering. There is 
a binary element matrix of clustering matrix which associates 
each of these groups all the time. Clustering matrix is defined 
as follows:

?. MODIFIED BEARING-ONLY DATA ASSOCIATION BASED 
ON JPDA ALGORITHM
1) Improvement of data association based on JPDA 
JPDA’s computational cost is high because the association 
hypothesis event number between target and measurement is 
exponential expanded. It is very disadvantage to the bearing-
only tracking system. For shortage of distance information, 
threatening target is hardly to identify quickly. So, the real-time 
of tracking processing is very crucial. At present, the problem, 
which is harmonizing the contradiction between computational 
precision and computational cost, hasn’t been resolved. 
Moreover, if the distance between the two targets is very near, 
it is still possible to bring estimation bias and track aggregation. 
Its radical reason is that the association measurement has made 
greater contributions to state estimation of all targets when this 
measurement falls into their association gates at the same time. 
As a result, the state estimation of every target intends to be 
identical.  In engineering application, some approach are 
presented as follow 
2) Anomaly  processing of over-expansion of  feasible 
event number 
Computational complexity mainly arises from the over-
expansion of feasible event number. For the distribution of 
dense clutter, feasible event from clustering matrix will 
expand out of control. It leads to long running time. Especially, 
system collapse potentially occurs in course of target tracking. 
Aiming at the problem, specify a decision approach for total 
number. It is depicted as compelling program to end the 
splitting of clustering matrix when feasible event number  
EN  Emax (22) 
where Emax is defined as upper limit number of feasible event.  
Then, the target in the clustering is treated as missing in 
the current cycle. And substitute one-step prediction for 
filtering state of the next cycle. 
3) Anomaly  processing of the probability of false event 
According to the splitting rules of JPDA algorithm, the 
first feasible event is false event. The fist column elements of 
its matrix are all 1, which indicates that all measurements 
come from false target. However, the probability under this 
circumstance is very small in target tracking phase with dense 
clutter. Therefore, the engineering system treats it as anomaly 
and compels the event probability to averagely process.  
4) Anomaly  processing of the probability of the feasible 
event 
In theory, the sum of all feasible event probability from a 
clustering matrix is 1. And the probability of every feasible 
event PE ? [0,1]. Whereas, some calculated probabilities 
wouldn’t satisfy this condition for machine’s miscalculation. It 
leads to target missed because of subsequent false association 
probability. Aim at this Anomaly, the probabilities of all 
feasible events are compelled to averagely process. That is, 
PE=1/n where n is total number of feasible event. By analysis, 
this approximation has little affected the actual tracking effect. 
5) Anomaly  processing of the association between 
measurement and target 
When the confirmed measurement number is more than 
one, the association probability between the certain 
measurement and the tracked target is large so that the 
probability is close to 1. The tracking system treats it as 
Anomaly. If the some false measurement exists in the 
association gate of the target and it is closer to the tracking 
target than real measurement in dense clutter, the anomaly will 
occur which is that false measurement has bigger association 
probability than the real one. Under the circumstance, false 
measurement contributes more to state estimation so that 
target missed is inevitably. Aim at this anomaly, this system 
still adopts averagely processing. 
?. POSITIVE DEFINITE GUARANTEE OF INVERSE MATRIX 
AND ELIMINATION OF ILL-POSED MATRIX
In course of target tracking, many inverse matrixes such 
as filtering covariance matrix need to solve inverse. These 
matrixes are positive definite in theory. However, for the 
reason of finite word length of computer, error is accumulated 
with time going so that the filtering covariance matrixes lost 
the feature of positive definite and symmetry. Obviously, 
filtering divergence will appear and it will lead to tracking 
missed. Moreover, ill-posed matrix might appear. When 
solving its inverse, the results are very unstable. Filtering 
divergence also will appear. Solution in the engineering 
application is shown as follow: 
1) Positive definite guarantee 
According to the condition of positive definite, first, 
compel the matrix to symmetry. Then, resolve to get its 
eigenvalue and determine if positive or negative. When all 
eigenvalues are positive, do nothing and go on. If there is a 
negative eigenvalue, the matrix isn’t a positive definite. Under 
the circumstance, all diagonal elements of the matrix will plus 
an appropriate positive number. The process will go on till the 
matrix is positive definite. 
2) Elimination of ill-posed matrix 
First, resolve to get eigenvalue of the matrix. Then 
verdict if its certain eigenvalueis is close to zero. If existing, 
the matrix is ill-posed, or else operation goes on. In this 
tracking processing system, the diagonal elements of the 
matrix will plus an appropriate number X, where X?[2,5]. 
The process will go on till the ill-posed matrix is eliminated.
?. DESIGN OF TRACK MANAGEMENT MODULE
 Track management exists throughout the tracking process. 
Its performance also directly determintes tracking effect. In 

tracking phase,  the establishment and management of the 
target file is a key indicator for tracking system. Good track 
management will effectively recognize varieties of targets and 
help to reduce computational complexity. More important, it 
provides a base for the posterior situation assessment and threat 
estimation. Tracking management is realized by a globally 
unique track number and track logo.  Since these processes 
such as formation of new target and  deletion of missing target 
all exist in tracking phase all the time, considering that 
economize  resource of system, traver every existing target 
number at the current moment before numbering new target. If 
old target is missing, its number is replaced by new target. 
Then modify old target logo of track property. Or else, 
continue to number based on old total targrt number with order 
and create new target logo.  
1)  Design track logo 
It is important to estimation of threatening level. So, target 
state devides into threatening target and ordinary target.  And 
track devides into new, old, missed and deleted. Considering 
the necessary to record the historical infmations of the target 
tracks, design the track logo as structure body array shown in 
tab.1. The difference of the target state is used to provide the 
guidance  of  logo change for target tracking. Its value is 
defined as array shown in tab.2, where i is target number.  
2) Some approaches of track management 
If the target displacement of radial position is little, 
namely satisfy formula 5, in the three consecutive sampling 
cycles, regard it as threatening target. 
1 mink kr r r !                                                           (23) 
where kr is bearing-only position vector at time k and minr  is 
settings for threatening level. 
       If the target state isn’t renewed by filter, namely nothing 
of measurements fall into the association gate of the target, in 
the three consecutive sampling cycles, regard it as missing. 
Obviously, if track initiation is completed within the three 
cycles, target track will be not intermittent when viewing track 
map of target.

?. THE PROCESSING OF SUSPECTED THREATENING TARGET
According to the characteristic of bearing-only tracking, 
the estimation of threatening target is very important for lack 
of distance information. The most intuitive feeling is that 
suspected threatening target whose attacking velocity is high 
and attacking angle change is small. Especially, those 
stationary targets need to be tracked first and foremost. In real 
application, if the equation 24 is satisfied in three consecutive 
scan cycles for the estimation state of the target, it is 
considered as a threatenting target and target threatening 
degree is upgraded.

where  k`  is bearing-only position vector in sample time k,
TC  is threatening decision angle given by system.  
Moreover, confidence measure based on this decision is 
not high. Where, some additional information from passive 
sensor can be used such as gray change information, area 
change information, etc.  Use of this information 
can   improve threatening estimation precision to some extent.  
?. SIMULATION
Where, three selective maneuvering targets are shown in 
fig.1 in Cartesian coordinate and in fig.2 in bearing-only 
coordinate. Assume that measurement noise is Gauss white 
noise whose coefficient is 0.005rad. In this tracking filtering 
algorithm, there is an IMM filter composed of 3 models. 
These models are depicted as: There is a different Q matrix for 
model 1 and model 2. Both of them are CV model whose state 
noise coefficient respectively are 0.1 and 0.01. Model 3 is 
chosen as CA model whose state noise coefficient is 0.01.

?. CONCLUSION
For presented improvement of data association and track 
management approach, simulation result indicates their 
effectiveness. Computational complexity is reduced clearly 
under the premise of better tracking precision. According to 
simulation result of whole track processing system and 
application of actual ship-borne infrared system, adopting the 
modified JPDA based on a series of anomaly processing is 
suitable for bearing-only tracking by using a passive sensor. 
Whereas, the phenomena of track aggregation sometimes still 
appear yet. This problem needs to be resolved in later work.
