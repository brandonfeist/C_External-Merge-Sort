Abstract—This paper firstly analyzes the current measures of 
association rules and then proposes a measure of match as the 
substitution of confidence. Considering that there are often two 
kinds of situations in transaction database: (1) the importance of 
different itemsets are different. (2) When new data are added, 
how to reflect the popular information of the added database 
while guaranteeing the correlation between the antecedent and 
consequent of the rule. In view of the above situations, this paper 
presents two weighted association rule mining methods, and 
compares them with the method under the traditional framework 
of support-confidence. The experimental results show that the 
antecedent and consequent of the rules generated by the 
proposed methods have higher correlation and the generated 
rules also highlight the important itemsets as well as the 
influences brought by the new data. The proposed methods can 
make the mined association rules have more practical 
significance.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In the research field of data mining, association rules 
mining is a basic but important research work. It is the base and 
prerequisite of many other data mining research areas. Mining 
association rules is aimed at finding correlations between the 
different items in a database, which can be used to find the 
patterns of customer’s purchase such as how the transactions of 
buying others. Such rules can be implemented to design the 
merchandise shelves, to manage the stock and to classify the 
customers according to the purchase patterns. At present, the 
main research work about association rules includes efficiency 
analysis, correlation analysis and the applications of rules.  
Efficiency analysis mainly studies how to generate frequent 
itemsets efficiently. Since R.Agrawal et al firstly introduced the 
association rules mining algorithm Apriori [1], many researches 
have done to make corresponding improvements according to 
the shortage of Apriori. FP-growth [2] is a mining method 
which doesn’t generate candidate itemsets. The key idea behind 
FP-growth is to use a data structure called FP-tree to obtain a 
compact representation of the original transactions so that they 
can fit into the main memory. The algorithm generates itemsets 
from shorter ones to longer ones adding items one by one to 
those itemsets already generated. It divides mining the FP-tree 
into mining smaller FP-trees, and it can greatly induce the 
research time. But when the database is dense or the support 
threshold is relatively small, the number of the frequent 
patterns will increase exponentially. It becomes an impossible 
task to find all the frequent patterns. In fact, there are a large 
number of redundant frequent itemsets. So the researches use 
several methods reduce the redundant frequent patterns. At 
present, the most popular method is to adopt the frequent 
closed itemsets mining algorithms, such as A-Close [3], 
CLOSET [4], CHARM [5], CLOSET+ [6] and FPClose [7] etc. 
The difficulty of frequent closed itemsets mining algorithms is 
to check whether itemsets are closed. Frequent closed itemsets 
mining algorithms generate a relatively smaller result set, so 
the algorithms have better expansibility and intelligibility.  
Aim at the correlation of the generated rules. (1) In order to 
make the rules more interesting, researchers have put forward a 
number of metrics of interestingness. In [8] three types of 
metrics: (any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond) are 
proposed to take place of support. In [9] a new metric of 
interestingness by using the information of classification is 
proposed. It gives a definition of interestingness: the support of 
rule is R times more than expected, or the confidence is R 
times more than expected. R is a constant that user specify. In 
[10] an improvement is made based on interestingness in [9]. It 
took account of generalization as well as specialization. In [11] 
a measure of interestingness is derived: P(AB)/sqrt(P(A)P(B)) 
from the correlation of statistics. It contains two important 
factors: interest factor and support. In [12] a significance 
measure for association is proposed by making use of 2?  
correlation test. Its interestingness was defined 
as ( ) /( ( ) ( ))IS P AB P A P B= . Because of the shortcomings of 
symmetric interestingness in [12], in [13] Certainty: P(A) P(?
B)/P(A??B) is proposed. But it is anti-symmetric for the 
rules. (2) Finding negative association rules. For example, in 
[14] the search space is limited through a combination of pre-
discovered association rules and the domain knowledge and it 
is possible to discover fewer amounts but more interesting 
negative association rules. According to negative rules, we are 
interested in finding the items that have been purchased with 
other items with a very low probability. That is to say, it needs 
to discover the items in a transaction that are rarely appear at 
the same time. In [15] a framework based on correlation is 
proposed. In this framework, it uses residual analysis to 
determine whether two items are independent. In [16] a method 
based on linear regression and reverse authentication is 
presented to verify the correlation of the association rules. The 
method is based on the analysis of the correlation of the 
incident and verifies the generated rules through the selected 
                                                                                                                                          2950
time period. Therefore, how to select the size of time period 
will become an issue which is worth exploring. 
In this paper, we firstly analyzes and studies the correlation 
of generates rules, and then propose a method of weighted 
association rules mining based on the existing related 
achievements. Use weighted association rules can highlight the 
influence brought by the important itemsets and it makes the 
generated rules not only have higher correlation but also have 
more practical significance.  
II. THE BASIC PROBLEMS AND MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION 
RULES 
The basic problems of association rules are described as 
follows. Assume },,{ ,21 miiiI …= is a binary set, in which 
parameters miii ,, ,21 …  are called items. Assume transaction T is 
the item set with the restriction of T ? I. Define D as the 
transaction set. Let X be the set containing some items in I, and 
the transaction T will include X if X ? T. The length of the 
item set is defined as the number of the items in it. Association 
rules are those implications that can be depicted as X? Y, 
where X ? I, Y ? I, and X?Y=?. The support of the rule 
X? Y in the transaction database D is the ratio between the 
transaction number including X and Y in the transaction sets 
and all the transaction number, which can be written as 
support(X? Y), that is to say support (X? Y)=|{T:XY ? T
? TD}|/|D|. The confidence of the rule X ? Y in the 
transaction sets is the ratio between the transaction number 
including X and Y and those including X, which can be written 
as confidence (X? Y), that is to say confidence (X? Y)=|{T: 
XY ? T, TD}|/|{T: X ? T, TD}|. 
Given a transaction set D, mining association rules is to 
find the rules whose support and confidence are respectively 
larger than or equal to the minimum support threshold 
(minsup) and minimum confidence threshold (minconf) given 
by user. Therefore the association rule mining can be divided 
into two sub-problems as follows: 
(1) Find out all the itemsets, the support and confidence 
of which are larger than or equal to the minsup required by the 
customers. The itemsets with minsup are called frequent sets. 
(2) Set up association rules through frequent sets. Finding 
out all M’s non-empty subsets ms to each frequent set M. 
Association rule m=>(M-m) can be obtained when 
support(M)/support(m)>=minconf. support(M)/support(m) is 
defined as the confidence of the rule m=>(M-m) where m is the 
antecedent of the rule and M-m is the consequent of the rule.  
The framework of support-confidence is always used to 
generate association rules. But it will also produce a large 
number of redundant and unrelated rules. Support denotes the 
frequency of itemsets’ occurrence. We can find that the 
regularities exactly only when itemsets can occur frequently. 
Otherwise, it is hard to find out the regularities included in the 
itemsets. Confidence can denote the probability that some 
itemset’ emergence will lead to others’ occurrence. But we 
notice that the confidence of association rule F=>E only 
considers the possibility of the case when E and F will occur 
simultaneously, without considering the possibility of the case 
when only E occur and the case whether E and F are 
correlated. Then many association rules obtained are 
ineffective. 
III. FRAMEWORK OF SUPPORT-MATCH 
According to those problems discussed above, we find that 
the depiction of confidence is not consummate. It is inadequate 
to describe the correlation among itemsets. The paper adopted 
the existing the research results [17] and applied the framework 
of support-match  to substitute support-confidence . So the 
generated rules must satisfy the minimum support and the 
minimum match. Match is defined as follows: 
Assume P(A) denotes the probability that A occurs, P(B) 
denotes the probability that B occurs, P(AB) denotes the 
probability that A and B occur simultaneously, P( A B) denotes 
the probability that A  and B occur simultaneously, P( A ) 
denotes the probability that A doesn’t occurs. Then, we define 
the match of rule A=>B as match = (the confidence of A=>B)-
(the confidence of A =>B), that is: 
P(AB) P(A B)
P(A) P(A)
match = ?                           (1) 
To facilitate the understanding and calculation of the 
formula, the above formula can be transformed as:  
P(AB) P(A) P(B)
P(A) (1 P(A))
match ? ×=
× ?
                      (2) 
We make the declaration that an itemset is unrelated to any 
other itemset when its support is 1, in which case we can 
overlook the match of this item set with other item sets. 
Consequently, the probability for any itemset A’s occurrence is 
0<P(A)<1. The range of match is [-1, 1] because 
0<P(AB)/P(A) ?1, 0<P( A B)/P( A )?1. If match>0, we have 
P(AB)>P(A)×P(B), which proves that A and B are correlated. 
If match=1, we have P(AB)=P(A)=P(B), which indicates the 
case that A and B appear simultaneously. 
Furthermore, we analyze the match theoretically. We 
define the concept of correlation. 
P(AB)
P(A) P(B)
cor =
×
                               (3) 
P(AB)1
P(A) P(B)
cor =
×
                             (4) 
Hence, we have ( 1) ( )match cor cor P B= ? × . We will get 
1 1cor cor= = when cor  equals to cor1 for the reason that  
1 P(A)1
1 P(A)
corcor ? ×=
?
. That is to say, A is unrelated to B when 
A is unrelated to B. Moreover, 1cor  will be smaller than 1 
while cor  is bigger than 1. In other words, A is negatively 
correlated to B if A is positively correlated to B. We can also 
find from the equation that the definition of match  not only 
                                                                                                                                          2951
includes some correlation factors but also some ( )P B  factors. 
Therefore, it can reveal the validity of rule A=>B with the 
definition of match. 
IV. THE WEIGHTED ASSOCIATION RULES MINING 
A. Horizontal weighted association rules 
In transaction database, the importance of different items is 
different, but we usually need to strengthen the influence of the 
important items. Therefore, we can weight different items so as 
to underline the importance of the important items. Such 
problems are called horizontal weighted association rules 
problems [18].  
Assume I={i1,i2,…im} is a set of items. If there are L items 
which are more important, and we set these items the 
corresponding weight hj (?1), the weight of the rest items is 1. 
The weighted support for itemset A={a1,a2,…alenth} whose 
length is length which is defined as follows. 
1
1sup ( ) ( )sup( )
lenth
h m
m
A h A
lenth
=
= ?                   (5) 
But if adopting the framework of support-confidence, the 
weighted confidence is defined as follows. 
( ) sup ( ) / sup ( )h h hcon A B AB A? =                 (6) 
From the definition of the weighted support we can find 
that the value of the weighted confidence may be greater than 
1. Hence, the obtained rules after weighting are hard to 
understand and the parameter of the minimum weighted 
confidence is difficult to determine. Besides, the value of 
confidence itself can’t reflect the correlation of the antecedent 
and consequent of rules. Therefore, we aim at defining 
weighted match that can not only reflect the correlation of the 
antecedent and consequent of rules, but also reflect the 
influences on the final rules after weighting items. We assume 
the weight of the itemset when it occurs is same to that when it 
doesn’t occur. The definition of the weighted match is as 
follows. 
AB
A
h P(AB) P(A B)( ) ( )
h P(A) P(A)h
match A B? = ?              (7) 
where Ah  is the weight of the itemset A, ABh  is the weight of 
the itemset AB. The definition of the weighted match not only 
guarantees the compatibility of rules when not weighting, but 
also considers the influences on rules after weighting. 
B. Incremental Updating Association Rules Based on 
weighting 
According to the problem about how to maintain the 
association rules after adding new data, the current researches 
mainly contain: (1) how to efficiently update rules using the 
existing rules; (2) how to reflect the popular information 
contained in the added database. This paper does some 
researches on the second problem. In order to find the popular 
information contained in the new added database, we use the 
weighted support to underline the influences on the final 
frequent sets brought by itemsets from the added database, and 
combine the framework of support-match to generate 
association rules. 
Assume DB is a transaction database, and db is the new 
added database. |DB| denotes the number of transactions in DB, 
and |db| denotes the number of transactions in db. For any 
itemset A, its support is defined as follows. 
0 0 1 1sup( ) sup ( ) sup ( )A w A w A= ? + ?             (8) 
where sup0(A) denotes the itemset A’s support in DB, and 
Sup1(A) denotes the itemset A’s support in db, w0 is the weight 
of itemset in DB, and w1 is the weight of itemset in db. 
Weights are set with the size of the database. The setting of 
the weight is relevant to the size of database. The weights are 
calculated using the following formulas.  
0
| |
| | | |
DBw
DB db
=
+
                                   (9) 
1
| |
| | | |
dbw
DB db
=
+
                                 (10) 
But the above formulas actually mean that the support of 
itemset A doesn’t weight and it is consistent with the 
incremental updating algorithm. In order to highlight the 
influence of the new data, the weights are usually set as 
follows: 
0
| |
| | | |
DBw
DB db
?
+
                             (11) 
1
| |
| | | |
dbw
DB db
?
+
                             (12) 
The rules can also be produced in the same weighting way. 
We define match as follows: 
0 0
1 1
( ) ( )
( )
match A B w match A B
w match A B
? = ? ? +
? ?      (13) 
where 0 ( )match A B?  is the match of itemset AB in DB, 
1( )match A B?  is the match of itemset AB in db. By using 
weighted match, the popular information contained in the new 
added database is highlighted. In real applications, we can use 
only weighted support, or just use weighted match to reflect 
the popular information according to actual needs. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
This paper uses the adult database to verify the 
effectiveness of the weighted association rules mining 
algorithm. Experiments are carried out on a Lenovo notebook 
computer with 256M memory and 2GHz main frequency. We 
use Apriori algorithm to produce the frequent itemsets. We 
compare the number of rules generate by our proposed method 
with that generated under the traditional framework of support-
confidence. 
The parameter setting for the adult database is as follows: 
In the framework of support-confidence, support=0.4, 
confidence=0.8; in the framework of support-match, 
support=0.4, match=0.4. The number of rules generated under 
the two frameworks is shown in Fig 1.  
                                                                                                                                          2952
Fig 2 shows the experimental results of horizontal weighted 
association rules mining. We use two ways to test the generated 
rules: (1) weighted support-confidence; (2) weighted support-
match. The parameter is set as follows: In the framework of 
support-confidence, support=0.4, confidence=0.8; in the 
framework of support-match, support=0.4, match=0.4. 
We weight the items whose codes are from 1 to 9 and their 
weights are 1.1, 1.2," , 1.9 respectively. The number of rules 
generated under the framework of support-confidence is 
multiplied by 10.  
Experimental results show that the framework of support-
match can not only mine the effective association rules, but 
also can reduce the weak-related rules. So it guarantees the 
rules provided to users have high correlation.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper discussed and analyzed the deficiency of the 
current framework of support-confidence and applied the 
framework of support-match to substitute support-confidence. 
It can greatly reduce the redundant and the weak-related rules. 
Besides, we can also use other improved methods to produce 
frequent itemsets. Based on the framework of support-
confidence, this paper presented two weighted association rule 
mining methods. The experimental results showed that the 
antecedent and consequent of the rules generated by the 
proposed methods have higher correlation and the generated 
rules also highlight the important itemsets as well as the 
influences brought by the new data. The proposed methods can 
make the mined association rules have more practical 
significance.
