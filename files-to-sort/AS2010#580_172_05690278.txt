Abstract—With the development of personalized recommendation 
research, it has become increasingly important that how to select 
proper technology to set up recommendation system. In this paper, a 
few familiar personalized recommendation technologies are 
introduced briefly at first, while their characters are also analyzed. 
Then, corresponding strategies are put forward according to 
characteristics of products and guests. Structures of personalized 
recommendation system are suggested and their work principles are 
analyzed.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The advantage of E-commerce recommendation system is 
that it can automatically analyze user’s materials so as to find 
guest purchase trend and give suggests accordingly. Internet 
surfers can get information and purchase suggestions when 
they visit E-commerce Website. Their purchase decisions are 
made with the help of the recommendation system attached 
Website. So personalized recommendation system in an E-
commerce website simulates a salesman in the business 
process. A well worked personalized recommendation system 
enables business website three advantages: 
• Turn a website visitor to a purchaser. 
• Improve e-business website cross-selling ability. 
• Improve user’s loyalty of an e-business website. 
Recently, researchers have down a great deal studies in 
personalized recommendation field. There are lots of scientific 
research results. In a certain condition, this recommendation 
algorithm may get ideal recommendations. However, so fast 
the development of internet based e-business and so 
complicated of recommendation system as to the available 
recommendation algorithm has its inaccuracy, delay, etc. 
Therefore, to analyze various recommendation algorithm has 
great significance to set up an e-commerce recommendation 
system. 
II.  FAMILIAR E-COMMERCE RECOMMENDATION 
ALGORITHMS 
Generally speaking, personalized recommendation has 
three stages. They are data gathering, data analyzing and 
forming recommendation result. Among which, the date 
analyzing is key stage to find knowledge [1]. 
A. User Bbehavior Based Product Recommendation 
Algorithm 
The custom’s purchase behavior can be evaluated by 
whether their demands are met. When they are doing shopping, 
actually, they are going through a cognition process. While 
they evaluate all characters of available products they know 
these products and thereby make decision of purchase. 
Customs may gather widely information of all kinds of 
products at beginning to know them generally. Gradually, the 
range they focus is shrunk, they will move their attention to the 
products in which they are interested. Therefore, we can learn 
custom’s demands according to their online behaviors. 
We can get product recommendation algorithm under two 
assumptions as below[2]: 
• Custom only clicks those items in which they have 
interesting, so as to learn further information about 
those products. 
• Custom stay at a page for a long time means he or she 
pay more attention on products in this page. 
User behavior based product recommendation method 
obtains custom’s information through analyzing their online 
behaviors without additional custom inputs. With this method, 
the custom’s information can be update in time. On the other 
hand, because system need dynamically track every custom, 
record their behaviors and analyze them, it will consume a 
great deal of computer resource. 
B. Recommendation Based on Association Rules 
Association rules is a statistical result which indicates how 
many customs bought product X and therefore bought product 
Y. This algorithm recommends products to customer by the 
rule and what he or she has bought. Association rule data 
mining technique can find products’ relativity. So it is used 
well in retail trade. 
C. Collaborative filter recommendation algorithm 
Collaborative filter recommendation algorithm built a 
model according to user’s information, such as registration 
data, product marks, and purchased items[7]. Using the model, 
the system gives recommendations to custom. There are two 
kinds of this algorithm: 
• User-based Collaborative filter recommendation 
algorithm 
978-1-4244- 7618-3 /10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE
  
It gives recommended list by custom purchase records. It 
works under an assumption, that is, if two customs have same 
purchase recorders they will also select same product. It finds 
some aim custom’s neighbor first. Then, the aim customer will 
give scores to the unmarked product referring to his or her 
neighbor’s doing. The recommendation results are at the top of 
the mark list. 
• Item-based Collaborative filter recommendation 
algorithm 
It is based on similar items scores for the user to predict the 
scores of aim item. It is also based on an assumption: If the 
majority of users are quite similar to the scores of some items, 
then, user at present, will give the same scores to the item. 
Items-based Collaborative filtering recommendation system 
uses statistical techniques to find certain items nearest 
neighbors. Because the present user and his nearest neighbors 
tend to give same scores to target item, therefore, the item 
scores predicted by current user can be get from his close 
neighbors. The algorithm choices a number of high scores as 
recommendation result to feedback to the user.  
Collaborative filtering algorithm recommendation is 
currently get studied in depth, and it is also get widely used as 
well[6]. However, it also faces many challenges. They are: 
• Product scores data is extreme sparsity. With the 
development of e-commerce, the number of users and 
product items increase rapidly, therefore resulting in 
extremely sparse score data. In the circumstances of 
extreme sparse score data, the quality of the 
recommendation will be significantly decreased, 
sometimes may have not any results.  
• Automation recommendation. At present, most of the 
collaborative filtering system asks users input 
requirements at first. Users must explicitly provide 
product scores. This may bring accuracy 
recommendation, but also causing inconvenience to 
users.  
III. CHOOSE STRATEGY BASED ON CUSTOMER 
CHARACTERISTICS 
The purpose of personalized products recommendation is to 
meet the individual needs. Then personalized recommendation 
system design and strategies should highlight the needs of the 
customers. Different customer Characteristics should use 
different strategy and recommendation system. Customers can 
be divided into familiar Customer and unfamiliar customers by 
the amount of his information. 
A. Strategy to Unfamiliar Customers 
Such customer includes all non-registered customers, and 
registered but inactive customers. Some of these clients might 
be potential customer. At beginning of his or her visiting, if 
system provides a consistent recommendation, these potential 
customers are likely permanent consumers. As system does not 
have these customer’s history information, it is necessary 
collect such customers’ online information and make 
recommendations.  
User behavior based product recommendation algorithm is 
applicable to such customer. System should catch those 
information include visiting path, sequential pattern and 
viewing time. Pay attention to exclude circuity time. The too 
short visits tend to reflect customer have no interest on the 
content, it could be excluded from the click-stream. Then, 
classify the pattern sequence to identify the types of customer 
want products. The key of this system is to optimize algorithm 
to enhance system real-time ability. 
B. Strategy to Familiar Customers 
Familiar customers frequently visit website, they are loyal 
customers of the e-commerce website and the main serve 
objects of recommendation system. As such customer’s 
information can easily get, so the collaborative filtering based 
recommendation algorithm is fit for using here.  
On the One hand, based on product attributes model, 
system recommends products by customer’s purchase history 
recorders, on the other hand, based on relations between 
products, system recommend products which has close 
relations for customers. Association rule algorithm can reveal 
the intrinsic relationship between the products. Some of them 
are ignored by people or difficult to find. Therefore the 
recommended result is creative. As a matter of fact, not only is 
it a recommendation, but often can help clients choose 
complementary products, such as clothes match.  
User-based collaborative filtering algorithms and item-
based collaborative filtering algorithm cooperate with each 
other and complement each other. Thus, the recommendation 
can avoid duplication and singleness. 
IV. CHOOSE STRATEGY BASED ON PRODUCT 
CHARACTERISTICS 
Different types of products should be recommended by 
different systems. According to being purchased frequency, 
products can be classified frequently purchased products and 
less frequently-purchased purchased products. 
A.  Frequently Purchased Products 
Being quickly consumed products, such as food, daily 
necessities and cosmetics frequently purchased products, such 
as books, CD, VCD, clothes, etc. are belong to this kind. To 
form recommendation of these products, the system analyzes 
the customer's personal information, their previous record of 
online shopping and browsing records to infer his personal 
parameters. The core of such kind of recommended system is 
to learn parameter which represents customer purchase trend 
and to make proper adjusts because of customer interest 
changes. 
 In the information-gathering phase, users may be given a 
form in which they can clearly indicate their interest. This is 
the most efficient method to obtain new customer’s parameters. 
Modularization system construction is suitable used to process 
these products. Each module independently carries out their 
respective mandates first, then recommend products in 
cooperation[4]. Figure 1 is the system architecture.  
  
In figure 1, Information Module and Monitoring Module 
are charged of collecting customer information. Information 
module submits a form enables users to show his interest. 
Monitoring module records what product pages, contents 
customers have browsed and classifies them in the background.  
Information Management module is the core of the whole 
system. It establishes and keeps maintaining personal profile 
for each customer. A personal profile consists of two parts: a 
personal forecasting model and a group of product items which 
attaches figures indicate the extent of custom prefer. System 
pre-defines some modules which can represent the most 
characteristic types of products, and keep analyzing these 
modules. When customer changes the parameters, client profile 
will be adjusted.  
Learning module establishes prediction model on the basis 
of its client profile. Those products can reflect custom 
character included in personal profile will be treated as 
eigenvector. Through training eigenvector, classifier can be 
established. Classification result is different degrees of 
preference on product parameters. Learning module always 
work passively, when new client register or custom parameters 
changes cause to system quality decline, it can be activated by 
information management module at any time.  
Performance module begins to work from customer 
entering the system. It decides whether or not to recommend a 
product to the corresponding customer through analyzing 
customer model. Performance module charge of tracking 
recommendations, and send feedback information to the 
Information Management module. Performance module will 
notice information management module to build a new 
forecasting model, when system quality decline to a certain 
extend. 
B. Less Frequently-Purchased Purchased Products 
Products such as appliances, durable goods, etc., they are 
not purchased frequently. So infer customers parameters will 
be very difficult because of lacking of history recording 
information. There little correlation between purchases. 
Moreover, the requirements are different for each purchase. So 
deducing the former parameters is not necessary any more. In 
such case, customers often have no corresponding knowledge 
to evaluate such a product, so expert’s recommendation 
become extremely important. Recommendation system must 
have a special knowledge in the field and can interact with 
customers at real time. 
Such a recommendation system is not built on the model of 
analyzing past clients, but access and analyze customer’s 
demand at the time so as to help him find a most suitable 
product. Of course, customers need to simply identify the 
product he needs first, describe the specific product 
characteristics or functions he wants. Comparing the 
description and products available to find the similarities, 
recommendation system selects products closing to his wants. 
Then, customer may revise his selects. Recommendation 
system will make out new recommendations based on the 
adjustment. This process may be repeated several times. 
Finally, customers will be gradually found his really wants. 
Helping with such system, customer can quickly approach 
to information he want. The system will enable customers 
chose products in their unfamiliar field or make their fuzzy 
demand became clear[8]. Figure 2 shows the system 
architecture of this recommendation[10].  
Interactive module is responsible for collecting customer's 
chose. Since most customers do not have sufficient knowledge 
of related fields to answer professional question or give 
quantitative description, interactive modules are usually give 
qualitative questions to their customer. For example, instead of 
asking custom how many pixel value of monitor he want, 
interactive modules will ask customers how about the clarity 
extent he prefer, which can be divided into five grades. The 
next step, interactive module passes his collects, customer’s 
qualitative demands to analysis module.  
Analysis module searches database to find proper products 
to meet the want according to the requirement. The key of this 
part lies in the similarity calculation. It is often get by calculate 
character value with a power. Here, the power is defined in 
advance by experts and customers. 
The expert module has two main functions, the one is 
translating quantitative characteristics of the products into 
qualitative features in advance, the other is correcting product 
items generated by analysis module. Because customer may 
give mutual contradictions requirements, in this case, it may 
cause system unable to work or poor performance without 
taking manual intervention.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
Personalized Product Recommendation System plays an 
important role in e-commerce. However, the current system 
still has many deficiencies. Many factors constrain its 
development, such as rapid increase amount of product, client 
and trade. All these elements may cause data sparse, 
scalability, real-time and accuracy problems. Other factors may 
also affect recommendation strategy. For instance, customers 
may have different product requirements when he shops for 
himself and select gifts for his friend.
