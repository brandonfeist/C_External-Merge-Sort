I.  INTRODUCTION  
   At present, data mining is the most active branch of 
database research, development and application, and it also 
has been studying the hot. In recent years, in the process of the 
rapid development of data mining research and application, 
our predecessors have achieved certain results [4-6]. With the 
new and improved algorithms for emerging, the richer the type 
of data study, the gradual expansion of application fields, data 
mining technology is gradually integrated into the multimedia 
database. 
Because of the large amount of data, data structure 
complexity, patterns and diverse characteristics, the study of 
multimedia database has been a difficult one. With the success 
of data mining technology, people will look into a multimedia 
database for knowledge discovery. Data mining technology and 
multimedia information processing technology are organically 
combined form in the multimedia data to knowledge discovery, 
like this information processing method is multimedia data 
mining. In multimedia miner, such as “Find all images 
containing human faces”, the user interface will be gradually 
shown in different countries, different color, different 
expressions of the human face, not some Houlian or Malian. 
Thus it can be seen, multimedia mining is from a large number 
of multimedia data sets, through comprehensive analysis of 
audio-visual features and semantic, finding implicit, effective, 
valuable, and understandable patterns, arriving at the incident 
trends and relations, in order to provide users with problem-
solving ability level of decision support [2]. Based on the 
characteristics of Multimedia Database, although the 
multimedia data mining has attracted wide attention, it is also 
at the study start-up and exploration stage, Multimedia mining 
architecture and framework will be further studied, and the 
suitable for multimedia data mining method has also yet to be 
made. 
II. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MULTIMEDIA DATA 
MINING  
With the popular and universal of the audio and video 
equipment, digital camera, CD-ROM and the Internet, 
Multimedia database system is becoming increasingly 
common. It stores and manages a large number of multimedia 
data sets in multimedia database system, such as audio, video, 
images, graphics, sounds, text, documents and hypertext data. 
These multi-media information don’t have uniform structure 
and a unified approach, that, multimedia data is usually a 
multi-dimensional, unstructured or semi-structured, each 
media data has different characteristics, their own way of 
presentation of information, each media cannot only present 
the information separately but also can co-express the 
different characteristics of the same events, co-describe the 
existence, development and result of the event. So, there must 
be the main features of information, attributes and the 
relationship between them in multimedia data sets, or some 
models what people cannot get intuitively. Multimedia data 
mining is an intelligent data analysis, aimed at finding 
necessary results for making decision, countermeasures and 
fusion analysis from specific multimedia data sets. 
According to the data stored in multimedia database, 
multimedia database is mainly used in content-based image 
retrieval, sound delivery system, video on demand system, 
World Wide Web and identify the password command voice-
based user interface, and etc. Multimedia Mining mainly from 
the following five fronts: Image Mining, Video Mining, Audio 
Mining, Web Mining and Multi-Media Integrated Mining. 
Image mining is introduced the data mining technology into 
the image field of study, to discover the information and 
knowledge that hidden in a large number of image data, the 
non-trivial process of identifying hidden, valid, novel, 
potentially useful, and ultimately understandable semantics of 
information and knowledge from complex image data. 
Multimedia database supports for large objects, such as video, 
audio this data objects may reach a few megabytes of storage, 
these continuous media data need to be stable, pre-determined 
rate of real-time search, in order to prevent the image or sound 
from intermittent and the system buffer overflow. For these 
two kinds of mining, they need to integrate store and search 
technologies and standard data mining together. Web mining 
is the applications of data mining on the Web, it uses data 
mining technology from the resources associated with the 
WWW and behavior of interest drawn, useful pattern and 
implicit information, related to Web technology, data mining, 
computational linguistics, information science and other

fields, it is a comprehensive technology. Web Mining contains 
the following two kinds: ?Web content mining. It refers to 
mine the Web page content and back-office database is the 
process of obtaining useful knowledge from Web document 
content and its described contents of the information. It also 
can mine between organizational structure and links, to obtain 
useful knowledge from the artificial link structure. As the 
interconnection between the documents, WWW can provide 
useful information in addition to document content. Though 
the use of this information, you can sort the page, find the 
important pages. ?Web usage record mining. It is through 
mining the corresponding sites’ log files and related data to 
discover the site visitor behavior patterns, is the process to 
obtain valuable information. Above four aspects of mining are 
belong to single media mining, Multi-Media mining is organic 
integration in the process of kinds of single media data 
mining, comprehensive utilization of various media to achieve 
the purpose of knowledge discovery. 
III. THE SYSTEM MODEL OF MULTI-MEDIA MINING  
Multimedia data mining system emerges based on the 
development of content-based multimedia data retrieval 
system. At present, multimedia mining exists in main issues 
include: system framework model, multimedia mining needs a 
practical system framework model. Its general system 
structure model is shown in Figure 1.Below it will describe 
briefly the main function of the module in Figure 1. 
?Multimedia database  Multimedia database contains vast 
amounts of multimedia information such as audio, images and 
video binary data that are needed computer to handle, it is 
unstructured, we can not simply be expressed in mathematical 
analysis. Multimedia database must obtain the interpretations 
of content and information features based on these media 
objects, to complete the storage and retrieval application, the 
interpretations which obtained are called metadata. Content-
based metadata is related to the media information attributes, 
can not complete individually or automatically according to 
their content, must use the user’s descriptions or 
characteristics of media content to outline the characteristics 
of media objects. Basic media metadata includes text 
metadata, audio metadata, image metadata and video 
metadata, they constitute the basis for data accessing, and this 
is a prerequisite for efficient multimedia data mining. 
  
  Figure 1. Based on multimedia data mining model 
?Data Pre-Processor   Data pre-processing is to clean the 
data, the data stored in the database must be the necessary 
checks and purification, used to identify and correct or 
eliminate conflicts, incomplete data and combination of a 
database shared by the incompatibility. Data preprocessing 
main includes data cleaning, data integration, data 
transformation and data reduction. ?Data Cleaning: It mainly 
through the fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify 
or delete outliers and to resolve inconsistencies to “clean up” 
data. If the users think the data is dirty, and then they will not 
believe data mining results, in addition, dirty data will cause 
chaos in data mining process and result in unreliable output. 
?Data Integration: It is data storage, which data what come 
from different data sources integrate into the same. Metadata, 
correlation analysis, data conflict detection and resolution of 
semantic heterogeneity have contributed to the smooth 
integration of data. The image on behalf of the sun has 
different name in each database, one is called ”taiyang”, 
another is called “sun”, now combination will lead to 
inconsistency and redundancy, it should be avoided. ?Data 
Transformation: It is transforming the original and real data in 
the database into the suitable form for data mining. There are 
many image formats, so formats should be standardized, 
consistent in the same database. ?Data Reduction: Data cube 
aggregation, attribute subset selection, dimension reduction, 
value reduction and discrimination can be used to obtain the 
data reduction, to minimize the loss of information content. 
  (3)Mining Engine It is composed by a group of highly 
efficient and fast algorithms; these include classification, 
clustering, association summary and trend analysis, etc. For a 
particular task multimedia database, we should accord the 
results of data preprocessing to judge, and to choose efficient, 
appropriate algorithms. 
(4)User Mining Interface It is the visual tool for artificial 
analysts using, and also is a platform for data mining to output 
the result. According to the end user’s mission requirements 
and objectives, for the model of the excavation or the most 
valuable thing, you can use forms to express, including: rules, 
tables, pie, cube, curve, etc. With easy and straightforward

IV.  MULTIMEDIA DATA MINING METHOD 
A.    Multimedia data cube 
For multimedia data mining, according to the 
characteristics of multimedia data, you need to integrate store 
and search technologies and standard data mining method 
together. Promising approach involves multimedia data cube 
construction, multi-feature extraction of multimedia data and 
pattern matching based on similarity [3]. 
Design and construction of multimedia data cube is to 
multi-dimensional analysis of large multimedia database, is a 
kind of method which is similar to structure the traditional 
data cube from relation data. Multimedia data cube can 
contain dimension and magnanimity for multimedia 
information, such as color, texture and shape. Data cube is 
created to contribute to multi-dimensional analysis and a 
variety of knowledge mining of multimedia data based on 
visual content, including the summary, comparison, 
classification, association and clustering. 
Multimedia data cube can be many dimensional, for 
example: color, position, texture, keywords, image size or 
video bytes, image or video format type, image or video of the 
Internet domain, etc. Some of these properties many of which 
are set-oriented values, rather than single-valued. For 
example, an image may correspond to a set of keywords. It 
may contain a set of objects; each object corresponds to a set 
of colors. When design the data cube, if each keyword or each 
color is as a one dimension, this will lead the Victoria 
Disaster. Other hand, the dimension is too small, resulting in 
scale modeling of the image is too rough, limited and 
imprecise. Therefore, the design should be based on actual 
needs to balance processing efficiency and expressive power 
of multimedia data cube. Figure 2 is a simple model of image 
data cube. Multimedia data cube is an interesting model of 
multi-dimensional analysis for multimedia data, through the 
appropriate number of operations: roll-up, drill-down, slice 
and dice, shaft (rotation) can be a powerful analysis.

B.     Clustering Technology of Multimedia Data Mining  
Cluster analysis makes a data object decompose or divide 
into multiple classes, or clusters, so that the same class of data 
objects has a high similarity, but with other types of data 
objects has a great difference as far as possible. It is also a 
collection of data objects for analysis, and it is different from 
classification is that classification is a good pre-defined data 
types, and selects the known class labels of training data sets, 
belongs to supervised learning or guide learning. The 
clustering is an unsupervised learning, does not rely on 
training examples of predefined classes and class labels. 
According to describe the object’s property values, the object 
dissimilarity between the commonly is used distance metric to 
evaluate. Commonly used distance functions include: 
Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Minknowski 
distance, Manhattan distance, etc.  
Cluster analysis has a wide range of applications, including 
market or customer segmentation, pattern recognition, 
biological research, spatial data analysis, Web document 
classification, etc. Cluster analysis can be used as separate 
data mining tools to gain understanding of the distribution of 
data, and can also be other the preprocessing step of data 
mining algorithms for found in clusters.   
C.     Classification Techniques of Multimedia Data Mining 
Classification is a technique for multimedia data analysis, 
can learn from each property of a given set of multimedia 
divided into a predefined class label, so as to achieve the 
purpose of classification. Classifier is shown in Figure 3.With 
the tuple (x, y) that, where x is the set of attributes, while the y 
is a sample class label. 
 
  Figure 3.  Classifier 
Data classification can be achieved through the following 
two-step: ? Establishing classifiers of describing the 
predefined data types or concept sets. Classification is usually 
based on a particular characteristic of the media data to 
determine, the characteristic in the Meta database is 
demonstrated as audio-visual descriptors. By analyzing the 
descriptor’s value of part data in Meta database to construct 
the model, and make the media data which were used to create 
model as a training set. Training samples can be randomly 
selected, and give class label in advance. ?Using model to 
classify. First, assess the prediction accuracy of classifier, with 
a given accuracy on the test set to determine the accuracy of 
classifier, if the classifier accuracy is acceptable, you can use 
it to classify the next tuple. Classification is a gradual process 
of fine, pairs with the same type of label of the media data sets 
can also be classified in accordance with the above steps to 
continue. Commonly used classification can also use decision 
tree classification method, rule-based classification, neural 
networks, support vector machines and Naïve Bayes 
classification, etc.

The association rules mining of Multimedia data is from 
relevant data sets of image and video database to find the 
model which is shown frequent data item sets in the database, 
to predict the powerful decision-making based on the model. 
A typical association rules is: X?Y[S%,C%],where X and 
Y are a group of characteristics described predicate, S% is the 
support of rule(In all possible cases, X and Y appear together 
with the probability ),C% is the rule confidence(the 
conditional probability of Y occur while under the conditions 
of X occurs). Similarly, supposing D for the image collection, 
image mining association rules can also be expressed as: P1?
P2?…?Pn?Q1?Q2?…?Qm[S%,C%],where P1?
P2…Pn?Q1?Q2…Qm is the description predicate of image 
in D, can be the image size ,color ,texture, density, keywords, 
objects, spatial location, text description, etc, S% still 
represents the support of rules, C% represents the confidence 
of rules. 
Definition 1 If containing the ratio of image attributes P?
Q in D is Sup, then the association rule P? Q in D has 
support(Support) Sup,

In which, Support(P?Q) is the number of attribute sets 
which support P?Q in the database, n is the total number of 
attribute sets in the database. 
Definition 2 If the ratio of D contains Q when D contains 
the attribute set of P is Conf, then the association rule P?Q 
in D sets with the confidence Conf.

Where Sup (P?Q) is the support of P?Q, Sup (p) is the 
support degree of p. The mining problem of association rules 
is to generate the association rules of which can meet all user-
specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum 
confidence (minconf), and then the support and confidence of 
these association rules were not less than the minimum 
support and minimum confidence. Image database is shown in 
Table 1, in which property I1 presents large size of image,I2 
presents the keyword ”sky”, I3 presents the texture 
”transparent”, I4 presents the color ”blue”, I5 presents the 
format “JPEG”.

Supposing minsup=50%,then I={I2,I3,I4} is the frequent 
attribute set, the non-empty subset of I is 
{I2,I3},{I2,I4},{I3,I4},{I2},{I3}and{I4}.The corresponding 
association rules are: 
I2?I3? I4     conf=2/2=100%                                     ? 
I2?I4? I3     conf=2/2=100%                                     ? 
I3?I4? I2     conf=2/3=67%                                       ? 
I2? I3?I4     conf=2/3=67%                                       ? 
I3? I2?I4     conf=2/3=67%                                       ? 
I4? I2?I3     conf=2/3=67%                                       ? 
If the minimum confidence minconf=80%, then the result 
of final output will only generate (1), (2) two rules, that is 
strong association rules. Under the strong association rules can 
be inferred the following two decisions: “The sky of texture 
transparent is very likely blue” and “The texture of blue sky 
most likely is transparent”. Through the above examples, as 
can be seen, association rules’ mining is divided into the 
following two sub-problems: ?To identify all frequent item 
sets. The appear frequency of each data’s described 
characteristics is at least the same degree of support, this 
belongs to the frequent item sets, as this to identify all; ?To 
generate the strong association rules by frequent item sets: 
Focus on identifying the frequent items to meet the minimum 
degree of confidence, that is, meeting the strong rules. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper introduces a framework for multimedia data 
mining system, to illustrate the general process of multimedia 
data mining. At the same time, it has proposed several mining 
methods, but a description is primarily based on association 
rule. Multimedia data mining is the combination of data 
mining and multimedia database, it isn’t only an emerging 
research direction, but is also a challenging field of study, in 
future multimedia database mining is mainly content-based 
intelligent data retrieval, cross-index of a variety of media will 
also become a research hotspot, mining for multimedia data 
and intelligent information retrieval are the needs of future 
development.
