Abstract—With the development of market economy and the 
intensification of market competition, corporations require not 
only quick business process reengineering and continuous 
business process changing, but also faster information system 
reengineering correspondingly. In the presented paper, the 
author clarifies and elucidates the novel idea entitled 
“workflow technology”. Additionally, the author discusses the 
application of “workflow technology” in concrete systems 
using case analysis. The paper aims to improve corporate 
governance performance with enhancement of corporate 
business process reengineering via workflow technology. And 
the author innovatively suggests incorporating this technology 
into articles of association as instructional rules and 
regulations of corporate information management.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The corporate business process consists of a series of 
related tasks. These tasks are serially or parallel executed 
according to the administrative rules. And the business 
objectives of the corporation are completed simultaneously 
with the successful accomplishment of above tasks.  Since 
industrial age, process organization, management and 
optimization is the hot research of corporate management. 
And the related work has been progressive. Previously, the 
work was finished artificially before the introduction of 
management information system.  
However, the artificial business process reengineering 
and the traditional function-oriented information computer 
system were very limited and inapplicable with the 
development of modern corporations. Therefore, the 
corporations require a more efficient software system to 
enhance business process reengineering and automation.  
With the application of computer technology, corporate 
information management has several new developmental 
directions. The traditional computer management 
information system has three major functions entitled 
“transaction processing”, “information processing” 
and “decision support”. Information transmission and 
processing is known as a main function of computer 
management information system and basis of transaction 
processing and decision support of corporations and 
administrative departments. As a result, it is an important 
part of professional work of corporations and administrative 
departments. In mid-1980s, the concept of workflow arose 
with the prompt development of computer network 
technology, distributed database technology and multi-
computer cooperation work technology. Presently, 
workflow technology provides an amazing approach for 
corporations to achieve these business objectives.  
Moreover, the article of association is an agreement 
binding upon all parties. It is common for articles of 
association of corporations to provide for corporate 
management system. As soon as workflow technology is 
combined with articles of association, the application of 
technology takes legal effect on the corporation, 
shareholders, directors, and managers. 
II. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO WORKFLOW 
TECHNOLOGY 
Workflow is an emerging technology which has been 
developed quickly in recent years. Workflow management 
is a kind of technical means of effectively controlling and 
coordinating the execution of complex activities and the 
mutual information between man and application software.     
Although workflow technology has different application 
ranges and multiple implementation modes, seen from its 
application process, most implemented workflow 
management systems undergo four stages, entitled “flow 
definition”, “flow optimization”, “system 
development” and “workflow management system 
implementation”, shown as

 Compared with these stages of corporate business 
process reengineering above, it is seen that workflow 
technology can be used to support flow analysis, flow 
optimization, system implementation and project evaluation 
well; and workflow management system can be applied to 
carry out real-time monitoring and scheduling of examples, 
and realize the management and control of corporate 
processes. Therefore, workflow management technology is 
often used for implementing corporate business process 
reengineering.  
. 
III. THE APPLICATION OF WORKFLOW 
TECHNOLOGY IN CONCRETE SYSTEMS 
 
Take the use of workflow technology in the business 
process reengineering of a food corporation as an example 
to simply explain how workflow technology is exactly 
applied.    
In traditional corporate organization forms, various 
flows have not received enough attention. At that time, flow 
activities were so scattered in different functional 
departments that it was unable to embody due relations and 
difficult to describe the global flow process and mention the 
further optimization of flow. In fact, the essence of flow 
management is flow. Nowadays, the corporation breaks the 
original hierarchical departments, recombine them 
according to all activities with added value, and establish an 
organization on the basis of flow. These activities make the 
trend of key flows in the organization more clear and 
suitable for computerized processing and implementation.                
The workflow mentioned by us is an integrated 
technology containing various stages of flow management. 
And the use of workflow in flow management is divided 
into three stages, namely flow modeling, flow simulation 
analysis and flow optimization. It is concretely embodied as 
follows:       
? A    Flow modeling 
Establishment of a flow model (workflow model) 
according to the business process in a corporation refers to 
the description of a business flow by a formal definition 
which can be processed by computer. Flow modeling is an 
important basis of flow analysis and optimization. The 
business flow in a corporation is the reflection of the 
production and operation process of the corporation. 
Application of workflow technology to the flow 
management of the corporation requires that the workflow 
products have extremely strong flow modeling ability and 
the current workflow technology can realize it maturely. In 
this aspect, many research institutes of workflow technology 
have studied and developed description methods of 
workflow model. Common methods include directed graph, 
Petri net and formal language grammar of object model, etc. 
In the ordinary course of things, the main idea of the method 
of establishing a workflow model is to break down the 
business process of a corporation into a series of activities 
with logical relations, then describe the attribute of each 
activity and correlations among these activities to define a 
workflow model. To establish a workflow model, it is of 
overriding importance to understand the flow of corporate 
business process. Of course, the collection of such 
information needs the guidance and support provided by the 
idea of flow management. It ensures the workflow model 
established on the basis of correct information more correct 
and reliable. Only a comparatively perfect workflow model 
got at last can get the operation process of a corporation 
described more fully.                 
Taking the office outgoing message of Zhenxin Food as 
an example, the general flow of outgoing message 
management can be described as follows:     
The document newly drafted by a department is sent to 
the manager of the department for approval and then it is 
handed to the company office after getting the approval, if 
not, redraft it;      
The chief of office checks and approves it and reports it 
to company directors for approval. Company directors hold 
a meeting for approval, it is issued after getting the 
approval, if not, return it;     
Finally, the approved document is issued and filed away 
formally.   
After understanding this flow, we use the software 
IGRAFX PROCESS to establish the workflow model of the 
outgoing message management, shown as the following 
figure:

Based on Petri Net 
? B    Flow simulation analysis 
Corporate flow management is not to simply use various 
advanced automation and information techniques to realize 
the automation of corporate operation process, it increases 
key performance indexes of business process by optimizing 
and even reengineering the imperfect factors in the original 
flows. And therefore, analyzing flows and finding and 
solving problems are important links of implementing flow 
management.         
Workflow model reflects the structure and dynamic 
behaviors of business process comparatively 
comprehensively, so making a diagnosis of the existing 
corporate flow by analyzing the performance of workflow 
model is an effective and reliable method.    
We can carry out simulation analysis of model 
performance indexes by workflow simulation analysis 
method. After the simulation of workflow model is 
executed, the system will collect simulation data and 
58079
 provide users with the data for the quantitative analysis of 
the performance of the established workflow model.        
The simulation data include activity execution time, 
resource use time, activity cost and resource utilization, etc. 
Through the quantitative analysis of these data, we can 
judge which activities have the maximum cost, the longest 
running time, and expend lots of resources but bring small 
profits in the flows. And then we can analyze which 
activities are the key activities in the flows, and which flows 
can not bring such incremental effect that need improving or 
even reengineering.           
The response time of each step got by implementing 
workflow simulation of the above outgoing message 
management flow is shown as Table 1:

According to simulation many times, we find that the 
link "The corporate director checks the document" is the 
bottleneck and it tallies with the visual analysis in practice, 
the link needs to be determined by holding a meeting in 
which many departments and personnel are involved. As a 
result, it is difficult to unify their opinions. In order to 
realize the object of flow optimization and reengineering, 
checking time must be reduced.             
? C    Flow optimization 
After analyzing the simulation results of flow, we need 
to modify and optimize the workflow model, thereby 
achieving the goal of corporate flow optimization.      
On the one hand, workflow simulation execution can be 
used to compare several design schemes of business process 
and find out the optimal scheme from them. We can 
evaluate different schemes effectively and quantitatively, 
and then select the optimal scheme by modifying bottleneck 
links in the workflow model, analyzing, and comparing 
them. On the other hand, there are many methods of 
corporate flow optimization, such as changing transaction 
route, changing the execution time of a certain activity or 
some activities in the flow, changing organization structure 
and modifying the number of resources, etc. After such 
change is made, we can obtain the feasibility of the 
modification scheme easily by simulation execution, and 
achieve the goal of flow optimization by modifying the 
workflow model many times. Thus, the optimized workflow 
model is the basis of corporation’s actual business flow 
improvement.                                    
In the above outgoing message management flow, 
obviously, we optimize the step “The corporate director 
checks the document”. To improve work efficiency, only a 
special department is needed to fulfill check function. The 
response time of the optimized flow after simulation 
execution many times is shown as Table 2:

From the above analysis, we can see that good results 
can be obtained by optimization. Of course, it is only a 
simple example of optimization. In practical operation, the 
original flow may need a more thorough design and 
modification. Workflow technology provides a good 
simulation execution environment for us so as to avoid the 
failure caused by unforeseeable consequences after actual 
corporate flow is optimized.  
IV. THE INCORPORATION  OF WORKFLOW 
TECHNOLOGY INTO ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION  
When investors organize a corporation, they are bond by 
the article of association of corporations, which reflects their 
will of management of corporation. In other words, the 
articles of association drafted by shareholders are the 
instructional rules and regulations of corporate management.  
As for the corporation, it needs efficient management 
system, especially fast information system reengineering to 
optimize corporate governance performance. So, it is 
necessary to incorporate workflow technology into article of 
association.  
Only be set down in the article of association and 
registered by registration department, the workflow 
technology can get the credibility and authority of law.

 V. CONCLUSION  
Thus far, business process reengineering (BPR) is one of 
the hot and timely study focuses regarding management. 
Arising and development of BPR brings unprecedented 
change into corporations. Presently, workflow technology 
plays more and more important role in the development of 
BPR as an important facility. With the theoretical 
development and practical application of workflow, the 
bilateral combination of BPR and workflow will definitely 
improve the overall quality and benefit of corporation. 
Additionally, the incorporation of workflow technology into 
articles of association of corporation will be conducive to 
establishing an efficient operation management mode, and 
optimizing Corporate Governance Performance.
