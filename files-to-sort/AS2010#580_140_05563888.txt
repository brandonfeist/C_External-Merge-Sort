I. INTRODUCTION 
All kinds of disease poses a serious threat to human 
health, malignant lesions of cancer mortality rates are risi?g 
rapidly, this is a worldwide trend, and liver cancer mortaho/ 
accounted for all. There are many reasons of cancer, there IS 
no way to prevent cancer, so the early diagnosis of cancer for 
cancer therapy is a very important factor. Through the study, 
we found that the early diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis to 
prevent liver cirrhosis, liver cancer has important 
significance. CT examination is a kind of reliable to early 
detection methods of lesions. But because of doctor to read 
every hospital CT slices, a rate will be dropped, alth?ugh if .
a 
CT slices are two doctors diagnose, then read and dIagnosIs 
accuracy will be greatly improved, but it costs too much. So 
we need computer-aided diagnosis, hoping to achieve higher 
efficiency and better accuracy. 
This will be divided into two categories: CT images with 
normal and abnormal. The normal CT image refers to the 
health of people, abnormal image refers to the CT image 
with lesions. This will be a detailed description of the mining 
on liver medical CT images. 
II. BUILD LIVER CT IMAGE MINING DATA SETS 
A. Data collection 
In the hospital, one patient's CT slices are more than 20 
layers ,and has more than 20 CT images. In this paper we 
collect 10000 liver CT images from Guiyang medical 
hospital and Hainan medical hospital for mining. 
B. liver CT image feature extraction 
Liver fibrosis refers to a pathologic process with liver 
fiber connectie tissue hyperplasia when necrosis and 
inflammation of the liver cells stimulate. Liver fibrosis 
caused uneven surface, and Hepatic essence density change 
present uneven. On CT images of liver fibrosis, wavy edge

for presenting as smooth, serrated, liver surface color slants 
dark gray, rough, uneven distribution, etc. 
General image containing color, texture and shape, edge, 
shadow and time characteristics such as details. In this paper, 
We according to the characteristics liver CT images, extract 
liver texture feature. Texture can be considered a gray in the 
space with certain forms of design changes; is .

region of inherent characteristics. So QuantItatIve descnpt?on 
of the regional texture is an important method to descnbe 
area. Common texture analysis method is: the statistics, the 
structure, the method of spectrum method. In this paper we 
use based on the statistics of the gray level co-occurrence 
matrix method, extract the liver CT image texture feature. 
According to the characteristics liver CT images, we 
extracted features: 
Gray characteristics: Average CT (extraction in all areas 
of total value of regionallCT all pixel number), the lesion site 
in CT films is always more bright or dim, obvious difference 
in parts, so can extract around the characteristics as refere?ce. 
The texture characteristics: liver CT films of the lesIOn 
site with normal texture will be different, in this paper we 
from the perspective of CT images statistical analysis, 
extraction, the maximum entropy, the probability of energy, 
contrast, deficit, correlation coefficient from six to excavate 
the texture characteristics. Concrete analysis are as follows: 
Graylevel co-occurrence matrix and energy parameters 
reflect the regional uniformity of image and smoothness. 
Entropy is presented. The randomness of image 
measurement Contrast reflects the neighbour pixels. For 
maximum probability also reflects a cyclical appear to 
grayscale image, i.e. the local pattern arrangement, the 
biggest good regularity, when the maximum probabil?ty of 
certain probability is lesser, can infer that local mode IS not 
obvious, therefore periodical, the maximum probability is 
rational evaluation of quality graphics grain is one of the 
necessary conditions. In a certain extent correlation 
coefficient matrix and reflects the degree of linear correlation, 
correlation coefficient, grayscale distribution of the 
uniformity of the area, which reflects the uniformity of gray 
distribution images. 
Liver fibrosis, CT images reflect in the liver surface 
texture for rough, gray distribution to a range of gray image 
features, this change in energy and entropy for energy a?d 
reflects the entropy is reduced, And, because of liver fibrosIs 
after connectie tissue hyperplasia reduced the grain, and liver 
can lead to rational lowered maximum, The liver 
parenchyma density change, make appear uneven regional 
image gray distribution, which leads to low correlation 
coefficient, Liver surface color darkened in contrast, rise, to 
reduce the deficit from bottom contrast. 
C. build Liver CT image mining data sets 
The resulting CT images features and characteristics of 
some patients data, combined with the characteristics of 
patients have included patient age, gender, CT images of the 
lesion site position (left or right), so as to form of business 
organization in a data set. Data from a centralized affairs 
below: 
(CTID, LayerID, fl, f2, ···tn, gL g2, ..... gm, 
Class) 
Among them, CTID for CT affairs Numbers, LayerID for 
CT slices layer, ' fl··· .fn are the seven feature extraction 
from the given images, include gray characteristics , energy, 
entropy, maximum probability, contrast, deficit, correlation 
coefficient of the texture characteristics etc, gl··· .. gm said 
patient characteristics of the original, class says this CT 
slices of normal and abnormal category. 
III. ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION ON LIVER CT IMAGE MINING 
DATA SETS WITH ROUGH SETS THEORY 
A. Basic knowledge of rough sets theor/2J 
In 1982 PawLark of rough set theory is a kind of 
treatment uncertainties and fuzzy mathematical tool, its main 
idea is kept in the premise of classification, through 
knowledge reduction, export the decision or classification of 
problem. Attribute reduction is one core contents of rough 
set theory,is to keep the condition that knowledge 
classification is unchanged, delete not relevant or not 
important attribute. The following are some of the basic 
concepts of rough set: 
Definition 1: Rough set theory define information system 
for a quad: S=(U,A,V,F) , Which U=(x1,x2, ... ,xn) is 
domain; A is the attribute set, A =C U D, andC n D= <t> , 
Which C for the condition attributes, D for decision attribute, 
V is for attribute A domain; F isU X A -- V mapping, it is 
only specified value for all attributes of the object in U. S has 
been called the decision table. 
Definition 2: in information system S, attribute set I E A, 
can build according binary equivalent relations. 
IND(I){<x, y>EUXUI v aEI, a(x)=a(y)}, Says the IND (I) 
is the indiscemibility relation which be build by I. 
Indiscemibility relation is actually the equivalence relation 
on I . Therefore, with the indiscemibility relation on the 
attribute set I,U can be divided into several equivalence class, 
U can be divided into several equivalence class, 
Definition 3: Reduction is defined as the minimum 
condition attribute sets which do not contain redundant 
attributes and ensure correct classification. C' is reduction 
of the condition attributes C, C and C' must meet the 
following two properties analysis: 
(l)ind(C,D)=ind(C' ,D), no exit C" C:;;;C' , ind(C" ,D) 
=ind(C' ,D)o 
393 
(2)A decision table may also exists some reduction, C 
reduction set down as Red(C). 
The intersection of these reductions is defined as the 
Core of the decision table, Core(C)= n Red(C), The property 
in core is the important attribute affect classification 
B. The result of attribute reduction 
Use discemibility matrix to complete the reduction and 
core, on this basis generate the reduction attribute set, as: 
{energy, entropy, maximum probability, contrast, deficit, 
correlation coefficient} . 
IV. MINING ASSOCIA nON RULES ON LIVER CT IMAGE 
MINING DATA SETS 
A. Basic knowledge of association rules [1J 
In data mining association rules is one of the most widely 
used technique, a lot of association rules algorithm has been 
proposed, such as the most famous Apriori algorithm. The 
basic theory of association rules are defined as follows: 
Have I = {i1,i2, .. ... ,im} was set a collection. Set tasks 
related data collection of database transaction is D, each T is 
a collection of business, T belong to I. Set A is a collection 
contains T, affairs when, and only when A belong to T. 
Association rules is shaped like A = > B, including A, B 
belong to I ,and the intersection of A and B is empty. A = > 
B simply is A condition and A result: If condition then result. 
The database records reflect partial corresponding a funny 
behavior. For example: butter, milk = > bread (2% and 30%), 
This rule is the meaning of the butter and milk to buy the 
customer will buy bread, 2 %and 30% is support and 
confidence of the rule. Support and confidence are defined as 
follows: 
Support: a project in the database transaction of 
probability. The rules say the butter,milk and bread in the 
whole database transaction of probability is 3%. 
Confidence: confidence is aimed at association rules. A 
= >B rules With confidence C in the affairs of D means D 
contains A transaction also contain B percentage is C. 
Namely of conditional probability in P (B I A). 
While minimum support threshold and minimum 
confidence thresholds rules called a strong rule. Association 
rule mining is to find a strong rule. 
B. liver CT image association rule mining 
The next association rules applied to reduct data sets,we 
will need to focus the association rules defined as follows: 
the preceding paragraph of association rules is the 
characters sets of database, the latter of rules is classes of 
CT slices(normal and abnormal) 
In this paper we will set minimum confidence for 50%, 
Minimum support for 25%. In this paper the choice is 
minimum support of dynamic: First, set a high degree of 
support threshold for mining, By training set to detect 
association rules set accuracy, If we want the higher 
accuracy, So stop mining process, otherwise will support 
threshold minus 1, repeat appeals process, Until we find we 
need support threshold. In this paper, through the 
experiments of selected minimum support for 25%. 
We will be recorded in CT mining database 10,000 into 
10 group, establish mining model, in this model, the first 
group of set aside as a test data, the other nine combine into 
the training data to mining, and test the mining association 
rules in the first set aside, can get a accuracy. Above the 
process is repeated data in each group,can get ten accuracy, 
accuracy of mining model is average of 10 accuracy. 
Association rules test results such as shown in figure 1 in 
result 1, attributes are not reducted, accuracy 67.2 % is not 
very good, Mining effect is not very ideal. Through the 
reduction of attribute again after mining, the mining result 2 
in figure 1. Can see, this kind of data mining to improve 
accuracy result makes 98.7%.

C. Rule base and the new image classification Equations 
Finally, input the mining and clip of rules in rule base. 
Once a new image input, obtain all features of the image, 
classify the image using the rules in the rule base, Thus can 
judge the existence of CT images. 
D. Rule explained 
Rules in the rule base can be explained to natural 
language and be compared with the doctor diagnosed. Below 
are a few typical interpretation of the rules: 
l)Rule" CT images of energy<0.2 => CT image has 
lesions", Analysis is as follows: 
Because energy parameters of CT images reflect regional 
uniformity of images or smoothness, When the image of low 
energy, said to a gray distribution scope of gray, So the rules 
can be interpreted as " CT image gray distribution to a gray 
range, then the CT image has lesions". 
On medicine, when liver fibrosis, CT images in the 
reflection of liver surface texture for rough, will lead to a 
gray distribution, the scope of gray with our mining results 
are consistent. 
394 
2)Rule"Contrast <0.03,Maximum probability >0.55=> 
CT image has no lesions" , Analysis is as follows: 
"If CT images arranged partial model is good regularity, 
and rational grain distribution uniformity, the image has no 
lesions It. 
Explain the rules of above can be seen, liver image gray­
scale and texture features as judge whether existing lesions is 
consistent with doctor's clinical diagnosis, can be as an 
important reference for clinical judgment, is of high 
reference value and practical value. 
E. conclusion 
In this paper, we put forward a kind of association rules 
based on rough sets and combination of mining method, and 
describe the whole process of medical CT image mining in 
this paper. Firstly, the CT image mining process extracts CT 
image features and preprocess the data, and then changes the 
data into CT image mining database. Secondly, Mining the 
CT image mining database with rough sets and association 
rules techinique , Lastly, with the result rules we can help 
doctors to classify the CT image into two classes: normal 
and abnormal.
