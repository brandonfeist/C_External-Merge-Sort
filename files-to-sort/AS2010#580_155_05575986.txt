Association Rule ABC method generates much fewer 
rules and a lot of computation time is saved. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The huge volume of the biomedical literature 
provides a nice opportunity and challenge to induce 
novel knowledge by finding novel connections among 
logically-related medical concepts. For example, in 
1986,Swanson stated a theory that the disclosure of 
open knowledge people never discovered between 
documents with no literal relationship inside can be 
realized after the setup of logical recurrence relation 
among documents, based on which he discovered the 
connections of Raynaud disease and fish oil, which 
was clinically confirmed[1,2] afterwards. In 1988, 
using the same method, Swanson discovered eleven 
connections of migraine and magnesium[3]. 
One of the drawbacks of  Swanson’s method is that 
the method requires large amount of manual 
intervention and very strong domain knowledge, 
especially in the process of qualifying the intermediate 
concepts Swanson call the “B” concepts. In order to 
reduce the dependence of domain knowledge and 
human intervention and to automate the whole process 
as much as possible, several approaches [4,5,6,7] have 
been developed to automate this discovery process 
based on Swanson’s method. They have successfully 
not only replicated the Raynaud disease/fish-oil and 
migraine/magnesium discovery but also discovered 
new treatments for other diseases such as thalidomide 
[7]. Even though these research works have produced 
valuable insights into new hypothesis, however, 
substantial manual intervention has been required to 
reduce the number of possible connections. Specially, 
for association rule approaches [5,8], they all did not 
utilize semantic information to automatically reduce 
the huge number of possible connections among the 
biomedical concepts.. This will be very time 
consuming and produce a lot of spurious/meaningless 
hypothesis. This paper presents a Mining Biomedical 
Knowledge method Using Chi-Square Association 
Rule ABC ? it significantly reduces irrelevant 
connection and saves a lot of computation time. 
 
2. Method description 
 
2.1Information Measures 
 
1) Chi-Square: we adopt chi-square as information 
measure to measure the dependency between variables. 
This is the first attempt to discover implicit 
connections between concepts. For a term co-
occurrence matrix, let O be the observed frequency and 
E be the expected frequency, then the formula of chi-
square is
( )? ?= EEOX

. Chi square is more likely to 
establish significance to the extent that (1) the 
relationship is strong, (2) the sample size is large, 
and/or (3) the number of values of the two associated 
variables is large. A chi-square probability of .05 or 
less is commonly interpreted as justification for 
rejecting the null hypothesis that the two terms are 
independent of each other. The null hypothesis is very 
useful when filtering out those terms that are 
statistically independent of given term. In this chapter, 
for chi-square, the alpha value is set to 1% and 
accordingly the critical value is 6.63. 
2)  Association Rule: Association rule is frequently 
used in data mining applications [8, 9]. An association 
rule is of the form AÆB where B and A are disjoint 
conjunctions of term pairs. The confidence of the rule 
is the conditional probability of B given A, Pr(B|A), 
and the support of the rule is the prior probability of A

and B, Pr(A and B). The mining procedure can be 
described as follows: Given a document collection, a 
minimal confidence threshold and a minimal support 
threshold, find all association rules whose confidence 
and support are above the corresponding thresholds. 
Here A concept is taken as input, and then all AÆB 
rules are found out in one data set. Then, from a 
separate data set, BÆC rules are found out. Last, a 
transitive law is applied to get the hidden link: AÆC. 
It must be noted that associate rule algorithm can not 
be applied to get AÆC directly because A and C are 
not occurred in the same data set. A and C are 
connected through the bridge concept B. Finally, the 
following symbols are used to describe association 
rule: Support (B) means that the probability that B 
occurs. Accordingly, Support (B?C) means the 
possibility that B and C occur together. “Conf” 
indicates confidence. Conf=Sup(B?C)/sup(B) means 
the confidence that B implies C (BÆC). F (BÆC) 
measure is a measure of confidence of BÆC. The 
larger the value is, the more confident of BÆC is. 
 
2.2 Algorithm  
 
Chi-Square Association Rule ABC: Association 
rule is frequently used in data mining application to 
find the connection of two items. However, it’s hard 
for the method to explain the statistical significance of 
the relationship between two variables. For example, 
term “humans” is highly co-occurred with term 
“Raynaud disease”. In regards to the formula of 
association rule, term “humans” accepts the highest 
score in our experiment. However, when judging the 
statistical significance of the relationship between the 
two terms, term “humans” is ranked much lower. As a 
result, statistically unrelated terms by chi-square are 
filtered out to help improve the performance of 
generating novel implicit association rules. In another 
word, association rule method itself can generate many 
non-meaningful rules. Other method such as chi-square 
filtering can be applied to help pick up meaningful rule 
sets from the huge number of rules. As [10] mentioned, 
when considering the scale-free distribution of objects 
within the literature, it is apparent that some frequently 
mentioned objects could be co-mentioned many times 
with other terms without any actual biological 
association being implied. Therefore, chi-square as an 
important statistical means to measure the strength of 
association can help improve the performance of ABC 
and reduce a lot of unnecessary work. 
Input: (1) Concept A, (2) K (top B concept), (3) 
M(top C concept for each B concept), (4) time range of 
PubMed articles. (5) Direction of the rule generating 
(AÆBÆC or CÆBÆA). 
Download PubMed articles for certain time range to 
build term document matrix.  
A Chi-square dependency graph matrix is built 
based on the term document matrix. If the chi-square 
value between two terms is smaller than the critical 
value 6.63, it means that it accepts the null hypothesis 
that the two terms are statistically independent of each 
other (P<.05). Thus, the cell value of dependency 
matrix is set as zero.  
Generate BÆA rules or AÆB rules. Dependency 
graph matrix helps generate rule sets within which 
each term is statistically significant dependent of 
another. According to association rule, Let Confidence 
(P (BÆA)) =P (AB)/P (B), Support (B) =P (B), F 
measure (2confidence*Support/ (Confidence+ 
Support) is used to calculate the rule strength.  
All the B terms are sorted according to the rule 
strength. Top k B terms are picked from the list.  
Accordingly, all the CÆB or BÆC rules are 
generated if the chi-square between B and C are over 
the critical value. All the B terms can not be in the 
candidate C terms list, because all these terms co-occur 
with concept A. Similarly, only top M C terms are 
picked from each C term list. 
 
3.Experiment results and analysis 
 
3.1 Dataset 
 
For replication of Swanson’s Raynaud disease/ fish 
oils discovery, 1,737,439 citations, from 1980 to 1985 
in PubMed database are downloaded. MeSH terms are 
extracted from each article and a large term document 
matrix (16045*1,737,439) is built. As sparse matrix 
technique is applied, although it’s a large matrix, most 
of algorithms performed on it can be finished within 
several minutes.  
 
3.2 Comparison between methods of chi-
square, chi-square association rule and mutual 
info ABC 
 
From Table 1,we can see that chi-square association 
rule, compared with chi-square and mutual info ABC, 
saves a lot of computation time for generating 
unnecessary association rules. it dramatically reduces 
the computation time and complexity.

4. Conclusion 
 
This paper presents a Mining Biomedical 
Knowledge method Using Chi-Square Association 
Rule ABC. For a given starting medical concept, it 
discovers new, potentially meaningful 
relations/connection with other concepts that have not 
been published in the medical literature before. The 
discovered relations/connections are novel and can be 
useful for domain expert to conduct new experiment, 
try new treatment etc. As our future research, we will 
reduce and rank A concepts in a semantic manner, 
which would be a challenging issue. For this problem, 
we may need more disease specialized biomedical 
ontology.
