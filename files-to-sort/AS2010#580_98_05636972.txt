Abstract-The volume of stored data increases rapidly. 
Therefore, the battery of extracted association heavily 
prohibits the better support of the decision maker. In this 
context, backboned on the Formal Concept Analysis, we 
propose to extend the notion of Formal Concept through the 
generalization of the notion of itemset aiming to consider the 
itemset as an intent, its support as the cardinality of the 
extent. Accordingly, we propose a new approach to extract 
interesting item sets through the concept coverage. This 
approach uses an original quality-criterion of a rule namely 
the profit improving the classical formal concept analysis 
through the addition of semantic value in order to extract 
meaningful association rules. 
Keywords: association rules, formal concept analysis, 
quality measure. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The analysis of huge volumes of data is fundamental to 
explore the unknown information and extract the hidden 
patterns namely the association rules. 
The "Concept" is a couple of intent and extent used 
to represent nuggets of knowledge. A new trend recently 
appears focusing on building theoretical foundations for 
Data-Mining based on Formal Concept Analysis [1,2,3]. 
Accordingly, various motivating proposals have been 
advanced related to association rules [4]. 
In this paper, we introduce an original approach of 
association rules mining based on Formal Concept Analysis. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We 
devote Section 2 to the association rules extraction problem. 
Section 3 sketches the mathematical background of FCA and 
its connection with the derivation of association rule bases. 
We introduce, in Section 4, an heuristic algorithm to 
calculate the optimal itemsets. Results of the experiments 
carried out on benchmark datasets are reported in section 5. 
Illustrative examples are given throughout the paper. Section 
6 concludes this paper and points out future work. 
II. ASSOCIATION RULES EXTRACTION 
Usually, the number of the extracted association rules 
grows exponentially with the number of data rows and 
attributes. Thus, the understanding and the explanation of the 
generated patterns become a challenging task. 
To resolve this issue, several approaches were sharply 
proposed [17]. 
The huge number of the generated thousands and even 
millions of rules - among which many are redundant 
(Bastide et aI., 2000; Stumme et aI., 2001; Zaki, 2004) 
-[5, 6, 7, 8] promoted the proposal of more efficient 
discriminating techniques in order to decrease the number 
of obtained rules. 
This pruning technique can be backboned on patterns 
defined by the user (user-defined templates), on boolean 
operators (Meo et aI., 1996; Ng et aI., 1998; Ohsaki et aI., 
2004; Srikant et aI., 1997) [9,10,11,12]. 
Another trend dedicated to heavily diminish the number of 
rules emerged. It stresses on additional information that can 
be efficiently used such as the taxonomy of items (Han, & 
Fu, 1995) or a metric of specific interest (Brin et aI., 1997) 
(e.g., Pearson's correlation or x2-test) [13, 14]. More 
sophisticated methods that produce only lossless 
information limited number of the entire set of rules, called 
generic bases (Bastide et aI., 2000). The generation of such 
generic bases greatly employs a battery of results 
provided by formal concept analysis (FCA) (Ganter & 
Wille, 1999) [15]. 
Basically, the pruning strategy of association rules is 
based on fundamental methods namely the frequency of the 
generated pattern through discarding all the item sets having 
a support less than MinSup, and the strength of the 
dependency between premise and conclusion by pruning 
all the rules having a confidence less than MinConf. 
To efficiently prune the reported association rules, some 
researchers [16] provide other measures. Indeed, Bayardo et 
al suggest the conviction measure. Moreover, Cherfi et al [17] 
porpose five different measures namely the benefit (interest) 
and the satisfaction. Maddouri et al provide the gain 
measure [18]. 
In this paper, we introduce a new measure: the profit. 
Indeed, the latter is based on the Formal Concept Analysis 
[19, 20]. Assuming that an itemset is completely represented 
by a formal concept as a couple of intent (the classic itemset) 
and extent (its support), it combines the support of the rule 
with the length of the itemset. So, we propose to include a 
new semantic aspect on association rules extraction by 
considering the lift measure during the selection of frequent 
item sets when we generate the association rules.

III. MA THEMA TICAL BACKGROUND 
We recall some crucial results inspired from the Galois 
lattice-based paradigm in FCA and its interesting 
applications to association rules extraction. 
A. Preliminary notions 
In the remainder of the paper, we use the theoretical 
framework presented in [20). 
Let ° be a set of objects, P a set of properties and R a 
binary relation defined between ° and P [19, 20]. 
TABLE!. FORMAL CONTEXT 
0 A B C D I 
01 I I 0 0 
02 I I 0 0 
03 0 I I 0 
04 0 I I I 
05 0 0 I I 
Definition 1 [19]: A formal context (0, P, R) 
consists of two sets ° and P and a relation R between ° 
and P. The elements of ° are called the objects and the 
elements of P are called the properties of the context. In 
order to express that an object 0 is in a relation R with a 
property p, we write oRp or (0, p) E R and read it as "the 
object 0 has the property p". 
Definition 2 [19]: For a set A!;;;O of objects and a set 
B!;;;P of properties, we define : 
The set of properties common to the objects in A :  
A?={pEP I oRp for all oEA} 
The set of objects which have all properties in B : 
B .... ={oEO I oRp for all pEB} 
The couple of operators ( ?, .... ) is a Galois Connection. 
Definition 3 [19]: A formal concept of the context (0, P, 
R) is a pair (A, B) with A!;;;O, B!;;;P, A ?=B and B .... =A. 
We call A the extent and B the intent of the concept (A, 
B). 
Definition 4 [19]: The set of all concepts of the context 
(0, P, R) is denoted by cI> (0, P, R). An ordering relation (<<) 
is easily defined on this set of concepts by : 
(AI, Bl)« (A2, B2) ? Al !;;;A2 ? B2!;;;BI. 
Figure I .  Concept Lattice of the context (0, P, R) 
In this subsection, we remind basic theorem for Concept 
Lattices [19]: 
cI> (0, P, R, «) is a complete lattice. It is called the 
concept lattice or Galois lattice of (0, P, R), for which 
infimum and supremum can be described as follow: 
SUPi F I(Ai,Bi)=((UiF IAi)?"'" (n iF I Bi» 
Int; F I (Ai, Bi)=( n i F I Ai , ( U i F I Bi) .... ?) 
Example [IS]: table I illustrates the notion of formal 
context (0, P, R).The latter is composed of five objects {01, 
02, 03, 04, 05} and four properties {A, B, C, D}. The 
concept lattice of this context is drawn in Figure I 
containing eight formal concepts. 
Definition 5 [19]: Let (0, p) be a couple in the context (0, 
P, R). The pseudo-concept PC containing the couple (0, p) 
is the union of all the formal concepts containing (o,p). 
Definition 6 [20]: A coverage of a context (0, P, R) 
is defined as a set of formal concepts CV={RE I , RE 
2 ,  ... , RE n } in cI> (0, P, R), such that any couple (0, p) in the 
context (0, P ept of CV. , R) is included in at least one conc

Example [IS]: 
Considering the formal context (0, P, R) depicted by 
table I, the figure 2.a represents the pseudo-concept 
containing the couple (03, B) being the union of the concepts 
FC2 and FCs. 
A coverage of the context is formed by the three concepts: 
{FC4, FCs, FC6} such as: 
FC4 is the concept containing the items ({ 0 1, 
02}, {A, B}); 
FCs is the concept containing the items ({ 03, 
04}, {B, C}); 
FC6 is the concept containing the items ({ 04, 
05}, {C, D}). 
The lattice constitutes concept coverage.

IV. DISCOVERY OF OPTIMAL ITEM-SETS 
As well known, the expensive step to derive association 
rules is the computation of the frequent itemsets [4]. In 
fact, this phase consists of applying, iteratively, an heuristic 
to compute the candidate itemsets. At the iteration i, we 
combine the itemsets of the iteration i-I. After that, the 
support threshold (MinSup) is used to prune non-frequent 
candidates. The itemsets of iteration i-I, are also discarded. 
We keep the remaining itemsets of the latest iteration 
n with n is the number of properties in the formal context. 
Two characteristics are defined during the derivation of 
association rules: (i) the support which is the cardinality of 
the set of objects which verify the rule. In Formal Concept 
Analysis, it refers to the extent of a formal concept; (ii) the 
cardinality of the Itemset which is the number of properties 
of the itemset. In Formal Concept Analysis, it refers to the 
intent of a formal concept. 
The intent is not sufficiently adequate to represent the 
association rule, the latter is entirely correlated to a formal 
concept namely both its intent and its extent. Having a 
support represented by the cardinality of the extent, a highly 
qualified selection of itemsets must be done according to the 
intent of the formal concept of the rule. 
Besides, the association rule generated from the formal 
concept should efficiently consider the quality of the 
relationship between the head and the body of the rule. 
To formalize the new criterions, we give the following 
definitions. 
Definition 7 : Let FCj = (Aj , BD be a formal concept. We 
define: 
Length of a concept FCj: the number of properties 
in the intent Bj of the concept. 
Width of a concept FCj: the number of objects in 
the extent A j of the concept. 
Lift of a concept FCj: the maximum lift of the set of 
rules generated from the concept Fe. 
Profit of a concept: is a function of the width the 
length and the lift of the concept, given by: 
length(FCi)*width(FCi) 
* .  Fe Profit(FCJ length(FCi)+width(FCi) lifte I) 
The profit measure depends on the number of properties. 
In fact, a less number of properties and a less number of 
objects, a less value of profit is noted. Having more 
properties and more objects induces to higher profit. 
Moreover, if we increase the value of a lift of the concept a 
higher value of profit is noted. 
Definition 8 : A formal concept FCj = (Aj,Bj) containing 
a couple (0, p) is said to be optimal if it maximizes the profit 
function. 
Definition 9 [20]: A coverage CV={ FC1, FC2, ... , 
FCk} of a context (0, P, R) is optimal if it is composed 
by optimal concepts. 
Example [18]: An illustrative example of the pseudo­
concept is sketched by figure 2. b represents the optimal 
concept FCs containing the couple (03, B). Figure 2.c 
represents the non optimal concept FC2 containing the couple 
(03, B). 
The optimal coverage of the context (0, P, R) is 
formed by three optimal concepts: {FC4, FCs , FC6}. FC4 is 
the concept containing the items ({ 0 1, 02}, {A, B}). FCs is 
the concept containing the items ({ 03, 04}, {B, C}). FC6 is 
the concept containing the items ( {04, 05}, {C, D}). 
A. Heuristic Searchingfor Optimal Concept 
The pseudo-concept, denoted by PCF, containing the 
couple (0, p), is the union of all the concepts containing 
(0, p). It is computed according to the relation R by the set 
of objects described by p, then {p} ?, and the set of 
properties describing the object 0, so {o} ?. Where (?, ? ) 
is the Galois connection of the context (0, P, R). 
When we determinate the pseudo-concept PCF, two cases 
are considered: 
Case i: PCF forms a formal concept. 
If no zero is found in the relation/matrix representing PCF, 
then, PCF is the optimal concept. So, the algorithm stops. 
Case 2: PCF is not a formal concept. 
If some zero entries are found in the relation/matrix 
representing PCF, we will look for more restraint pseudo­
concepts within the pseudo-concept PCF. 
So, we consider the pseudo-concepts containing the couples 
like (X, p) or (0, V). These concepts contain, certainly, the 
couple (0, p). 
The considered heuristic is the optimal concept 
undoubtedly included in the optimal pseudo-concept. 
We should generate all possible rules from the pseudo­
concepts containing the couples like (X, p) or (0, V). Then 
we compute the corresponding lifts and choose the 
maximum value between them. After that, we calculate the 
profit value. Finally, we retain the pseUdo-concept having 
the greatest value of the profit function to be the new PCF. 
This heuristic procedure (of case 2) is repeated until PCF 
becomes a formal concept. To calculate the profit of a 
pseudo-concept, we introduce the general form of the 
previous function: 
Definition 10: Let PCFj = (Aj , Bj , RD be a pseudo-concept, 
where Rj is the restriction of the binary relation R, to the 
subsets Aj and Bj . We define the: 
Length of a pseUdo-concept PCFj : the number of 
properties in Bj. 
Width of a pseudo-concept PCFj : the number of objects 
in Aj 
Lift of a pseudo-concept PCFj : is the maximum of lift 
found when we generate the set of rules extracted from the 
pseudo-concept PCFj . 
Size of a pseudo-concept PCFj: the number of couples 
(of values equal to 1) in the pseudo-concept. When PCFj is a 
formal concept, we have: 
Size(PCF)= (length(PCF) * width(PCF)) 
Profit of a pseudo-concept is a function of the width, the 
length, the size and the lift given by : 
_ 
Size(PCF) 
* Projit(PCF) - llength(PCF)+ lift(PCF
/ 
I (length (PCF)+ width(PCF))- Size(PCF)f

B. Algorithm for Optimal Coverage 
The problem of covering a binary relation by a set of 
optimal concepts can resolved by covering a binary matrix 
by a number of its complete sub-matrix. The latter is a matrix 
having all its entries equal to '1'. This problem, being NP­
Complete problem, has been the subject of several previous 
works. However, it's obvious to propose an approximate 
polynomial algorithm called enhanced Semantic Approach 
based on Formal Concept Analysis and Lift Measure 
denoted SAFCALM. 
Let R be the binary relation to cover. The proposed 
solution is to split R into n packages (subsets): Ph ... , Pn' 
Each package symbolizes one or more couples. 
The strategic idea of SAFCALM algorithm is to build 
incrementally the optimal coverage of R: 
(i) The first phase, covering the relation Rj =Pj by CVj. 
(iiJ The ith phase, let R i.j =Pj U ... U Pi.j and let CVi_j be 
its optimal coverage. Building the optimal coverage CVi of 
Ri =Ri_j U Pi using the initial coverage CVi_j and the 
package Pi. 
(iii) The nth phase, finally, finding a set of concepts 
covering the relation R.

Figure 3. Incrementation phase when adding P4 
Example: Let R be the relation to cover as highlighted 
by table 1. R is partitioned into five packages: 
Pj={ol}x{A, B}, 
P2={02}x{A, B}, 
P3={03}x {B, q, 
P4={04}x{B, C, D} and 
Ps={05}x{C, D}. 
Initially, R is an empty relation and in each phase we add a 
package. 
Figure 3 sketches the incrementation phase when adding 
P4. In this phase, R3 encloses the four rows P), ... , P3. The 
initial optimal coverage CV3 encloses the formal concepts 
FC3=({01, 02}, {A, B}) and FC4=({03}, {B, q). 
The package P4 encloses only three couples: (03,B), 
(03,C) and (03,D). 
The pseudo concept containing the couple (04, B) and 
(04,C) is : 
Case 1: the union of formal concepts ({ 03,04}, {B, q) 
and ({04},O) 
Case 2: the formal concept ( {04}, {B, C, D} ). 
The computation of the profit function is egal to zero in 
the first case and higher positive value in the second case 
according to the following formula: 
P CF 
Size(PCF) 
rofit(P J= I J * length(PCF)+ lift(PCF) 
I (length(PCF)+ width(PCF)- Size(PCF)} 
Hence, the retained formal concept is FC6=( {04}, {B, C, 
D}). 
Thus, the final coverage of R contains the concepts FC3, 
FC4 and FC6. Finally, according to our example, we find 
three Item-sets : {A, B}, {B, q and {C, D}. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 
It was worth the effort to experiment the potential 
benefits of our proposed approach. 
Experiments were conducted on a Pentium IV PC with a 
CPU clock rate of 3.06 Ghz and a main memory of 512 MB. 
The characteristics of benchmark datasets used during these 
experiments are depicted in table 2.

To shed hght on the performance of our approach, we 
compare our proposal to the three pionnering methods in the 
same trend in the litterature namely the Apriori algorithm 
and IAR approach. The latter is already based on FCA 
background. 
To analyze the data, we choose the following values of 
parameters: MinSup=0.35 and MinConf=0.75.

according to the runtime criterion 
Figure 4 depicts the runtime measured in seconds 
for the three algorithms. We notice that the three 
methods keep the same behavior overall the data sets. 
The Apriori algorithm needs the greater time because it is 
based on an exhaustive approach to test all the possible 
combinations. Our method SAFCALM efficiently 
outperforms the two algorithms JAR and Apriori thanks to its 
semantic selection of the frequent itemsets during the 
association rules extraction through the use of the lift 
measure. So, the non interesting itemsets will be discarded 
thus the needed runtime will greatly decreases compared to 
other methods. 
VI. CONLUSION 
In this paper, we discussed the extraction aSSOCIatIOn 
rules based on formal concept analysis. Assuming that an 
itemset is presented by the intent and the extent of a Formal 
Concept, we introduce a new approach SAFCALM 
backboned on lift measure to provide a semantic relationship 
on the formal concept used for association rule extraction. 
The carried out experiments of our proposal showed the 
performance of our method compared to the pionnering 
approaches in the same trend. 
Avenues for future work mainly address the following 
issues: (1) The application of visualization within a user­
driven approach, (2) the extraction of closed itemsets using 
our enhanced semantic approach of association rules 
extraction based on formal concept.
