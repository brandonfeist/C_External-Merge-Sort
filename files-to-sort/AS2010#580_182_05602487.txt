Abstract—With increasing Internet popularity, network secu-
rity has become a serious problem recently. Therefore, a variety
of algorithms have been devoted to this challenge. Genetic Net-
work Programming is a newly developed evolutionary algorithm
with directed graph gene structures, which has been applied
to data mining for intrusion detection systems and has shown
that it provides good performances in intrusion detection. In this
paper, a hybrid rule mining algorithm based on Fuzzy GNP and
probabilistic classi?cation has been proposed. Hybrid rule mining
uses fuzzy class association rule mining algorithm to extract rules
with different classes. Then, using different class rules and the
classi?cation of data is done probabilistically. The hybrid methods
showed excellent results by the simulation experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, as computer and communication technologies
develope, damages caused by an intrusion and crimes related
to computer systems have been increasing. Therefore, the
network security which can ensure the system to behave as
intended and to provide stable services becomes an important
matter. An intrusion detection system emerged to detect several
types of malicious behaviors that compromise the security and
trust of a computer system. Intrusion detection can extract
information from a computer or a network of computers,
and attempt to detect the presence of intrusion from external
sources, as well as the system abuse by authorized users.
Generally, intrusion detection is to separate the abnormal
data from the normal data. Therefore, the problem of intrusion
detection can be composed of two parts. The ?rst part is how
to extract useful information from the history database, then
how to organize such useful information to make accurate
classi?cation.
The conventional main intrusion detection techniques are
misuse detection and anomaly detection. Traditional misuse
detection approach detects intrusions based on the patterns
of known attacks, which has high detection accuracy for the
attacks having similar features to known ones. But, it fails to
recognize a brand new attack usually. Whereas, anomaly detec-
tion detects new attacks by modeling the normal activities of
the network traf?c and determining whether the deviation from
the established normal patterns can be regarded as intrusions.
However, the patters of normal activities may contain intrusion
traces, and also the activities of legitimate users may deviate
from patters of the normal activity. All the two aspects may
lead to high false alarm rates[1][2].
Genetic Network Programming(GNP), which is a kind of
evolutionary algorithms has been proposed in recent years and
applied to many ?elds such as traf?cs, stocks, elevator control
and etc.. It has a unique directed graph structure which is dis-
tinguished from the string structure of Genetic Algorithm(GA)
and tree structure of Genetic Programming(GP). The nodes in
GNP can be reused during evolutionary processes. This is just
a distinct feature for making GNP mine a lot of important
rules from the database, [3]-[6].
In this paper, a hybrid rule mining using GNP combined
with probabilistic classi?cation is proposed. On the basis of
the combination of misuse detection with anomaly detection,
fuzzy logic theory is introduced into GNP to extract fuzzy
rules. Then, the probability density function of the average
matching degree of the data with rules can be calculated. Based
on this, new connection data can be classi?ed into normal
activity, known or unknown intrusion.
This paper is organized as follows. In section II, basic
concept of GNP and traditional class association rule mining
are brie?y reviewed. Section III describes hybrid rules extrac-
tion combining fuzzy logic theory with class association rule
mining. Then, the probabilistic classi?cation is introduced in
section V. The simulation results using KDD99CUP data is
given in Section IV, followed by conclusions in Section VII.
II. CLASS ASSOCIATION RULE MINING BASED ON
GENETIC NETWORK PROGRAMMING
In this section, the basic concept of GNP and class associ-
ation rule mining based on GNP are reviewed.
A. Genetic Network Programming
GNP is one of evolutionary algorithm. The directed graph
structure is the distinct advantage of GNP[3]. GNP consists
of three kinds of nodes. They are start node, judgement node
and processing node. Fig.1 shows a basic structure of GNP.
The GNP in this ?gure has one start node, ?ve judgement
nodes and three processing nodes. The start node S is only
for determining which node should be the ?rst node to be
executed. The set of J1,J2, ...,Jm represents judgement nodes
which have conditional branch decision functions, and return
judgement results so as to determine the next node. Processing
nodes, like P1,P2, ...,Pn serve as action functions to determine

their concrete functions depend on the problem which are
determined by the designers.
Fig.2 is the genotype expression of GNP in a GNP indi-
vidual. NTi denotes node type. 0 is start node, 1 is processing
node, 2 is judgement node. IDi works as the identi?cation
number. Ci1,Ci2, ... mean the nodes connected from node i,
?rstly, secondly,... and so on. And di1, di2,..., dik denote the
time delays of the transition from node i to node Ci1, Ci2,...,
Cik, respectively.
In addition, there are three kinds of genetic operators,
selection, crossover and mutation in GNP.
B. Class Association Rule Mining Based on GNP
Association rules can discover the association relationships
or correlations among a set of attributes in a database. Let
I = {A1,A2, ...,Al} be a set of attributes and each tuple T
has a set of attributes satisfying T ? I. Associated with each
transaction is a unique identi?er whose set is called TID.
So, an association rule can be represented by the form of
X ? Y . The meaning of such an association rule is that
tuples satisfying X are likely to satisfy Y , where X and Y
are called antecedent and consequent of the rule, respectively.
If the fraction of tuples which contains X in the database
equals x, then we say support(X) = x. The rule X ? Y
has a measure of its strength called con?dence (X ? Y )
de?ned as the ratio of support(X
?
Y )/support(X). Assume
support(X) = x, support(Y ) = y, support(X
?
Y ) = z and the
total number of tuples is N. Then, ?2 of the rule X ? Y can

?2 = N(z? xy)

xy(1? x)(1? y) (1)
If ?2 is higher than a threshold value(3.83 at 95% signi?cance
level, or 6.64 at 99% signi?cance level), we should reject the
independence assumption. In this paper, important association
rules should satisfy the follow conditions:
?2 > ?2min, (2)
support? supmin, (3)
con?dence? confmin, (4)
where, ?2min, supmin and con fmin are the minimum of ?2,
support and con?dence values given in advance.
Class association rule mining aims to ?nd all the rules
from the database that form an accurate classi?er, where the
consequent is a classi?cation attribute. Attributes and its values
are corresponding to the functions of the judgement nodes in
GNP. The connections of judgement nodes are represented as
class association rules like the following form.
(Am = 1)? ...? (An = 1)? (C = k) (5)
GNP examines the attribute values of database tuples using
judgement nodes and calculates the measurements of associa-
tion rules using processing nodes. Judgement node determines
the next node by a judgement result of Yes or No correspond-
ing to Yes-side or No-side. Yes side of the judgement node is
connected to another judgement node. Judgement nodes can be
reused and shared with some other association rules because
of GNP’s feature. Fig.3 is an example to explain how class
association rules can be generated by GNP. P1 is a processing
node which serve as the beginning of a class association rule.
A1, A2, A5, A9 denote the function of the judgement nodes. N
is the number of total tuples. a, b, c, d, a1, b1, c1, d1 are the
numbers of tuples moving to the Yes-side at each judgement
node and the number of tuples moving to Yes-side at each
judgement node under the condition of class 1, respectively.
So, we can get many candidates of rules which have the form
like equation 5.

III. HYBRID RULE MINING
In this paper, hybrid rules are extracted and later used for
classi?cation. Hybrid rule mining is a synthetic method con-
sidering both data type and linguistic type, discrete attributes
and continuous attributes.
A. GNP-Based Fuzzy Class Association Rule Mining
GNP examines the attribute values of database tuples using
judgement nodes and calculates the measurements of associa-
tion rules using processing nodes[5]. Attributes and their val-
ues correspond to judgement nodes and their judgement values
in GNP, respectively. The conventional representation of class
association rules based on GNP is described in Fig.3. In this
paper, hybrid rule mining successfully combines Fuzzy GNP
with conventional class association rule mining, which utilizes
discrete attributes and continuous attributes in one single rule.
Fig.4 shows an example of hybrid rule mining representation.
The rule extraction starts from the ?rst processing node P1
and connects to a judgement node as shown in Fig.4. The
?rst judgement node examines the fuzzy membership value
of the continuous attribute A1 as Count high, the second
judgement node examines the value of binary attribute A2
as Land = 1, the third judgement node examines the value
of symbol attribute A5 as Service = htt p and the following
judgement node examines another fuzzy membership value of
continuous attribute A9 as Duration low. N is the number of
total tuples. The Pt in Fig.4 is the probability moving to the
Yes-side. In ?rst judgement node, GNP selects Yes-side and
goes to the next judgement node when random value selected
in (0,1) is smaller than the certain probability Pt which equals
to the fuzzy value of the corresponding attribute. Otherwise,
the connection will turn to another processing node and start
to examine other rules.
B. Fuzzy Membership Functions for Continuous Attributes
Fuzzy theory came from the desire to describe complex
systems with linguistic descriptions[7]. In most of the real-
world applications as data mining, the types of data are
complex, i.e., not only including the type of boolean, many
other types are also included. In this paper, we utilize the
advantage of fuzzy theory allowing every continuous attribute
to have membership values in [0,1]. Each continuous attribute
in the database is transformed into 3 linguistic terms (Low,
Middle and High) in the paper. Besides, the membership
function of each continuous attribute is evolved.

Fig. 5. Fuzzy Membership Function
Actually, these linguistic terms are de?ned by the com-
bination of trapezoidal and triangular membership functions
symmetrically spaced. The parameters ? , ? and ? of the
fuzzy membership functions are shown in Fig.4, which are also
evolved along with GNP evolution. Each continuous attribute
is associated with its own membership functions. Non-uniform
mutation was used for the evolution of the fuzzy membership
functions. Once a GNP individual starts the searching for
association rules, the fuzzy membership values are used to
determine the transitions in GNP individuals, which will be
explained in the next section.
C. Nonuniform Mutation of Fuzzy Membership Functions
Each continuous attribute has its own fuzzy membership
function. The parameters ? , ? for each continuous attribute
Ai are initialized by analyzing the distribution of data. Then,
? is automatically calculated by (2? ??). During the whole
evolution process, the parameters ? , ? , ? of the fuzzy member-
ship function should be adjusted generation by generation, so
as to get more appropriate distribution of parameters. From the
second generation the parameters are selected by non-uniform
mutation with the probability of Pm. Let xk be a parameter
selected for mutation in the kth generation, then we can see
xk+1 as follows.
xk+1 =
{
xk +?(k,UB? xk),when ? is0;
xk??(k,xk?LB),when ? is1;
(6)
where, UB and LB are the lower and upper bounds of
the variable xk, and ? is a random binary value in {0,1}.
The function ?(k,y) returns a value in (0,y), where ?(k,y)
approaches 0 as k increases. Such property causes the operator
to search the space uniformly at ?rst and very locally in the
later generations. The actual ?(k,y) can be calculated by the
following equation:
?(k,y) = y(1? r(1?k/T )? ) (7)
where, r is a uniform random number in (0,1), T is the
maximal generation number and ? is a system parameter
determining the degree of dependency on the iteration number.
D. Fitness Function
In this paper, we de?ned the ?tness function of GNP
individuals as
F = ?
r?R
{?2(r)+10(n(r)?1)+?new(r)}, (8)
- 2616 -
4where, R is set of suf?xes of extracted important rules; ?2(r)
is ?2 value of rule r; n(r) is the number of attributes in the
antecedent of the rule r. ?new(r) is additional constant de?ned
by the following equation
?new(r) =
{
?new, rule r is new,
0, otherwise.
(9)
IV. PROBABILISTIC CLASSIFICATION
After extracting a number of important class association
rules including normal and intrusion, a classi?er is constructed
to classify new connection data into normal, misuse and
anomaly intrusion correctly. The key points of probabilistic
classi?cation concerns three aspects. First, the probability
density function of the average matching degree of data with
rules is used. Second, the probability that data is classi?ed
to anomaly intrusion is also considered. Third, in order to
improve the classi?cation accuracy, weights are used to revise
the probability.
A. Probability Density Function
Before applying the probabilistic classi?cation, the proba-
bility density function should be generated. First, the matching
degree of each data d with every rule in the rule pool is
calculated. Here, the matching degree between data and rules
consists of two parts, i.e., the matching degree for continuous
attributes and the one for discrete attributes. The de?nition of
the matching degree between the continuous attribute Ai with
linguistic term Qi and data ai of attribute Ai is represented as
:
MatchDegreek(Qi,ai) = FQi(ai), (10)
where, FQi represents the membership function of linguistic
term Qi. Then, the matching degree between data and rule r
(including p continuous attributes and q discrete attributes) is
de?ned as :
Matchk(d,r) =
1
p+q
( ?
i?CA
MatchDegreek(Qi,ai)+ t), (11)
where, i is the suf?x of continuous attributes in rule r; CA
denotes the set of suf?xes of continuous attributes in rule r;
p and q represent the number of continuous attributes and
discrete attributes in rule r, respectively, and t is the number
of matched discrete attributes in rule r with data. Then, the
average matching degree can be de?ned as
mk(d) =
1
|Rk| ?r?Rk Matchk(d,r), (12)
where, Rk is the set of suf?xes of the extracted rules
in class k in the rule pool(normal rules or misuse rules).
Finally, the marginal probability density function f1(x1),
f2(x2),... fk(xk),..., fK(xK) can be generated by calculating the
distribution of the average matching degree of training data
d ? Dtrain(k) with r ? Rk, where, Dtrain(k) is the set of suf?x
of training data in class k. K = 2 is used in this paper.
B. Building a Classi?er
After creating the probability density function fk(xk) of the
average matching degree between training data d ? Dtrain(k)
and rule r ? Rk, the probability that new connection data d ?
Dtest belongs to class k is represented as follow:
Pk(d)=
? 1.0
mK(d)
fK(xK)dxK . . .
? mk(d)
0
fk(xk)dxk . . .
? 1.0
m1(d)
f1(x1)dx1,
(13)
where, Dtest is the set of suf?x of testing data. Actually, the
probability that d ?Dtest belongs to anormaly class is de?ned
as:
P0(d) = 1??
k?C
Pk(d), (14)
where, C is the set of suf?x of classes having training data. In
the case of two classes, the probabilities of the ?rst class and
the second class can be calculated by the following equations.
P1(d) =
? 1.0
m2(d)
f2(x2)dx2
? m1(d)
0
f1(x1)dx1 (15)
P2(d) =
? m2(d)
0
f2(x2)dx2
? 1.0
m1(d)
f1(x1)dx1 (16)
Then, the probability that a new connection data belongs to
anomaly class is calculated by P0(d) = 1??k?C Pk(d). Based
on the calculation of these probabilities, d is assigned to the
class with highest probability.
C. Revision of Probability
In intrusion detection, in order to balance positive false
rate(PFR) and negative false rate(NFR), we assigned the
following weights to adjust Pk(d) and P0(d)
Pk(d)? wkPk(d)
w0P0(d)+?k?C wkPk(d)
, (17)
where, w0 and wk (k ?C) are the weight parameters.
V. SIMULATION
The simulations were conducted on the intrusion detection
database of KDD CUP 1999(KDDCUP’99) which is publicly
available. This dataset was collected from a network simulat-
ing a typical U.S. Air Force LAN and also re?ecting dynamic
changes within the network.
The KDDCUP’99 intrusion detection dataset contains a
standard set of data to be audited, which was developed based
on the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program,
prepared and managed by the MIT Lincoln Laboratories. In
the KDDCUP’99 dataset, each record represents a TCP/IP
network connection with a total of 41 features. All the con-
nections can be divided into 5 categories including normal
network connection, and other four categories are Denial-
Of-Service(DOS), RootToLocal(R2L), UserToRoot(U2R) and
Probing[2][8]-[10].
We choose 10,000 network connections from KDDCUP’99
dataset which consists of 5,000 normal network connections
and 5,000 intrusion network connections including two kinds
of attack connections, neptune and smur f . The program was
based on the Fuzzy GNP algorithm and executed for 10 rounds

Fig. 6. Flow Chart of Hybrid Rule Mining using Fuzzy GNP
in order to calculate the average result. Its ?owchart is shown
in Fig. 6. We could extract about 30,000 to 40,000 rules
through evolution, and about 10% of which are normal rules
and the rest 90% are misused rules.
The testing dataset contains 10,000 network connections
which are also randomly selected from KDDCUP’99 dataset.
Besides normal network connection and two kinds of attack
connections, i.e., neptune and smur f , there are another four
kinds of unknown intrusions, namely portsweep, satan, nmap,

Here, the classi?cation results are evaluated by DR(detection

rate), PFR(positive false rate), NFR (negative false rate) and
Accuracy. Among these four evaluating standards, DR is the
total detection rate; PFR represents the probability that the
normal network connections are classi?ed as intrusion ones;
whereas NFR denotes the probability that the intrusion net-
work connections are classi?ed as normal ones; and Accuracy
means the network connections classi?ed correctly.
DR, PFR, NFR and Accuracy of the Fuzzy GNP are
calculated as follows:
DR = (1734+7490+138+330+6)/10000 = 96.98% (18)
NFR = (68+38)/(7888+182) = 0.48% (19)
PFR = (83+113)/1930 = 10.16% (20)
Accuracy = (1734+7490+138)/10000 = 93.62% (21)
and those of the conventional class association rule mining
method are
DR = (1591+7633+91+161+9)/10000 = 94.85% (22)
NFR = (94+82)/(7888+182) = 2.18% (23)
PFR = (237+102)/1930 = 17.56% (24)
Accuracy = (1591+7633+91)/10000 = 93.15% (25)
We can see from the above comparisons that the proposed
method has higher DR, Accuracy and lower NFR, PFR than
the conventional method. So, Fuzzy GNP outperforms the
conventional class association rule mining method, because
Fuzzy GNP overcomes the crisp boundary problem and has
the ability to deal with multi-datatype databases. Moreover,
the parameters of fuzzy membership functions are tuned by
nonuniform method during the evolution process in each
generation till the optimal parameters are selected. During this
processing, more important rules can be extracted suf?ciently
which could ensure the ef?ciency and interpretability of the
proposed method.
VI. CONCLUSION
The proposed method, that is, hybrid rule mining algorithm
based on GNP, combines Fuzzy-based class association rule
mining and probabilistic classi?cation in order to extract
more important rules from the database. In addition, the
classi?cation method is based on the probability distribution
of the average matching degree between data and different
class rules. As a result, simulations show higher DR, Accuracy
and lower PFR, NFR, which means that Fuzzy based GNP
class association rule mining has better performance than the
conventional class association rule mining.
