Abstract—Association rules mining is an important research field 
in data mining. Over the years, a variety of algorithms to find 
frequent itemsets in very large transaction databases has been 
developed. The key feature in most of these algorithms is that 
they use a constant support constraint to control the inherently 
exponential complexity of the problem. Long itemsets with low 
support can still be interesting but it is unable to find them. In 
this paper, we present a new association rule mining framework: 
fuzzy decreasing support-confidence that finds all itemsets that 
satisfy a length-decreasing support constraint. On this basis, by 
analyzing the correlation between the antecedent and the 
consequent of the generated rules, we further propose two 
correction frameworks: (1) Fuzzy Decreasing Support, 
Confidence, Interestingness; (2) Fuzzy Decreasing Support, 
Bidirectional Confidence, Interestingness; We extract data about 
the relevant factors of Syndrome Differentiation and the patients’ 
medication from the coronary heart disease data collected from 
the hospitals. The experimental results show that the frameworks 
proposed in this paper not only verify the existing Syndrome 
Differentiation and regular patterns of medication, but also 
discover Syndrome Differentiation with a combination of factors 
and medicine compatibilities among multiple drugs.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a common 
cardiovascular disease which does seriously harm to humans’ 
health. It belongs to the category of chest stuffiness and pains 
on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The research of TCM 
syndrome differentiation could help to improve the level of 
TCM treatment based on syndrome differentiation and clinical 
medication programs. Currently, the main research of CHD 
differentiation [1-3] involves in coronary angiography, QT 
dispersion and JT dispersion, ultrasonic cardiogram, blood lipid 
and so on. Mining association rules are absorbed into searching 
syndrome differentiation of CHD. Data oriented study becomes 
a new way for TCM syndrome differentiation of modern CHD. 
By analyzing the syndrome differentiation experiences from 
the famous or old traditional Chinese medicine doctors, we can 
discover some laws of syndrome differentiation and improve 
the accuracy of differentiation of doctors’ clinical CHD. 
Therefore, the introduction of data mining methods into the 
syndrome differentiation of CHD will have a huge theoretical 
and practical significance. According to the characteristics of 
TCM data, mining association rules based on the attribute 
constraint and the antecedent-consequent constraint is studied 
in [4]. In [5] the author uses search constraint to discover 
interesting association rules and reduces the number of 
generated rules. However, these approaches above make 
improvements on the basis of a constant support threshold, so 
they still can not mine the effective long patterns. According to 
the characteristics of CHD data, this paper uses the association 
rule mining algorithm with fuzzy decreasing support constraint 
to mine the relative factors of differentiation. 
II. RELATED WORK 
It is an important issue to mine association rules from 
transaction databases in data mining. Some relative definition 
is given in [10]. At present, the relative researches mainly 
include two aspects: (1) Aim at the long itemsets with potential 
value and low support, consider how to mine the frequent 
itemsets. (2)Aim at the correlation of rules generated, do the 
analysis and study how to improve the correlation between the 
antecedent and the consequent of the rule.  
Aim at the long itemsets with potential value and low 
support. Researchers have proposed the constraint of length-
decreasing support to generate frequent itemsets. A strategy of 
length-decreasing support for mining frequent itemsets is 
proposed in [6-7]. In this process, the original character: all 
subsets of a frequent itemset are frequent will be no longer 
satisfied. So it presents two new mining algorithms (LPMiner 
and SLPMiner) to improve efficiency. Based on the improved 
FP-tree algorithm, it analyzes the constraint of length-
decreasing support and introduces new search strategies and 
prune methods. However, the constraint of decreasing is not 
precise enough to accurately reflect the change of support of 
                                                                                                                                          2298
itemsets with different length. Attribute weight is combined 
with length-decreasing support to mine frequent itemsets in [8]. 
The strategy of decreasing here still has no regularity. It is 
difficult to determine the support threshold for the length of 
each itemsets in practical application. 
Aim at the correlation of the generated rules. In order to 
make the rules more interesting, researchers have put forward a 
number of metrics of interestingness. In [9] three types of 
metrics: (any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond) are 
proposed to take place of support. In [10] a new metric of 
interestingness by using the information of classification is 
proposed. It gives a definition of interestingness: the support of 
rule is R times more than expected, or the confidence is R 
times more than expected. R is a constant that user specify. In 
[11] a significance measure for association is proposed by 
making use of 2?  correlation test. Its interestingness was 
defined as ( ) /( ( ) ( ))IS P AB P A P B= . In [12] a method based on 
linear regression and reverse authentication is presented to 
verify the correlation of the association rules. 
III. FRAMEWORK OF FDSC 
A. Formula of FDSC 
The concept of length-decreasing support constraint is 
firstly described in [6]. This constraint can remove many short 
itemsets that are not frequent enough. However, the linear 
decreasing constraint is not precise enough to reflect the 
change of the support when the length of itemsets is changing. 
On this basis, the paper proposes a new constraint of fuzzy 
decreasing support to discover the corresponding frequent 
itemsets. In our problem the support of an itemset decreases as 
its length increase and it also can be applicable to datasets from 
different domains. So the correlation coefficient must be 
adjustable. Therefore, definition of the method is as follows: 
( )
, 1
( - ) ( ) + s,
,
f k
m k min
k maxm s min k max
min max
s k max
?
=
? ???
??
× < <?
??
???
    (1) 
where k is called the length of an itemset, s and m are 
constants, s(0,1), m(0,1) and s<=m., min, max and ? are the 
adjustment coefficients. Max is the maximum value of the 
length while min is the minimum length. When the length of 
frequent itemsets is smaller than or equal to min, the threshold 
of support gets the maximum value m. When the length of 
frequent itemsets reaches the threshold expects given, the 
threshold of support of this length will be the value of constant 
s, that is to say, the support will no longer reduce. Hence the 
range of f (k) is [s, m]. The parameters are set as follows: 
(1) If you set m=s, f (k) is using a constant support threshold; 
(2) If you set ?=1, f (k) is a linear decreasing function; 
(3) If adjustment begins decreasing when the length of itemsets 
is L, you only need to set min=L; 
(4) If f (k) is chosen as a fuzzy decreasing function and min 
and max are known. You can solve the parameter ? through a 
given k0 and a determined f (k0). The derivation formula is as 
follows: 
( ( ) )
( )
( )
( ) ( ) (
[( ) /( )] ( ( ) ) /( )

?
?
?

? ? = ? ?
=
         (2) 
(5) When f (k) is chosen as a fuzzy decreasing function, if 
decline curve is a form of upper convex, the range of ? is (0, 
1). If the decline curve is a form of lower concave, the range 
of ? is (1, ?).   
The significance of the formula is as follows: the formula 
contains first-order linear function and fuzzy decreasing 
function, and it can adjust the coefficients accordingly for data 
from different domains. Through the coefficient adjustment, it 
can not only satisfy the traditional association rule mining, but 
also satisfy the associating rule mining with linear decreasing 
support or fuzzy decreasing support. Therefore, it has higher 
flexibility.  
B. Related Properties 
Property 1 x y? ? , then ( ) ( )sup x sup y> . 
Property 2 Any itemset whose length is k satisfies: 
f(1)>=f(k)>=f(k+1), then f (k) is called a length-deceasing 
support constraint to the transaction database. 
Property 3 Any itemset x whose length is kx satisfies: 
sup(x)>=f(kx), then x is called a frequent itemset that satisfies a 
length-deceasing support constraint. 
Property 4 The property of smallest valid extension 
(SVE): Assume itemset x and itemset y, their length are kx and 
ky respectively and x y? , sup(x)<f(kx). Then the necessary 
condition that y is a frequent itemset to f (ky) is: 
1 ( ( ))yk f sup x
?>= . 
In our problem, an itemsets can be frequent even if its 
subsets are infrequent. So the traditional way to mine 
association rules loses effectiveness in removing the candidate 
itemsets. Therefore, we mainly use Property 4 and the constant 
f (max) to discard non-frequent itemsets. 
C. Generating Rules 
 (1)Find all frequent itemsets that satisfy a length-
decreasing support constraint. 
(2)According to the obtained frequent itemsets, generate 
association rules by using the confidence constraint. 
IV. TWO CORRECTION FRAMEWORKS, FDSCI, FDSBCI 
A significance measure for association by using 
2?  
correlation test is proposed in [11]. Its interestingness is defined 
as IS (A, B)=P(AB)/(P?A?P(B)). The formula is defined 
from the perspective of data. By calculating the Interestingness 
of the antecedent and the consequent of rule, we can know 
whether they have correlation. If IS (A, B) >1, it shows that A 
and B have a positive correlation. If IS (A, B) =1, it shows that 
A and B are independent to each other. If IS (A, B) <1, it 
shows that A and B have a negative correlation. Therefore, 
                                                                                                                                          2299
through the Interestingness formula, we can study the 
correlation between the antecedent and the consequent of rule 
from qualitative perspective.  
A. Framework of FDSCI 
In order to mine the rules whose antecedent and consequent 
have positive correlation, the paper adds a new metric-
Interestingness to generate association rules based on the 
framework of FDSC. Therefore, when generating rules for each 
frequent itemset, it must satisfy not only the minimum 
confidence, but also the minimum IS. We usually need to mine 
the positive correlation rules. So the threshold of 
Interestingness is larger than or equal to 1. This model is 
applicable to mining association rules with decision-making 
attribute. 
B. Framework of FDSBC 
Association rules are those implications that can be 
depicted as C=>K. It reflects the probability of the case when C 
and K will occur simultaneously and the conditional probability 
of the case when K will occur when C has occurred. Such rules 
can only determine the impact of K on C but can’t determine 
the impact of C on K simultaneously. Actually people are 
usually interested in mutual influence rules. For example, TCM 
prescription is a combination of herbs and the herbs in group 
must have mutual influence. For example, C is usually 
compatible with K, while K is usually compatible with C. If C 
is usually compatible with K but K is not usually compatible 
with C, K in this prescription are often drugs that play a 
supporting role and such drugs will appear in many 
prescriptions. Therefore, it can’t find the above drug group 
based on the traditional framework of confidence. In this paper, 
we propose a concept of bidirectional confidence. That is, 
When given a frequent itemset C1, C2, C3…,Cn, the rule 
C1,C2,..Ci=>C(i+1),C(i+2)...Cn satisfies the minimum confidence 
and at the same time the rule C(i+1),C(i+2)...Cn=>C1,C2,..Ci also 
satisfies the minimum confidence. Then the rule C1, 
C2…Ci=>C (i+1), C (i+2)...Cn is called the rule that satisfies 
bidirectional confidence constraint. When two rules are 
generated, we only need to maintain the one with lower 
confidence. Considering whether C1, C2,.. Ci and C(i+1), 
C(i+2)...Cn have positive correlation or not, we still add the 
metric Interestingness to mine the rules that have positive 
correlation. This model is applicable to mining mutual 
influence association rules. 
Therefore, the generated rules under this framework must 
satisfy: 
(1) According to the generated frequent itemsets, find out 
all the rules that satisfy the minimum bidirectional confidence 
constraint;  
(2) According to the generated rules, pick out all the rules 
that satisfy the minimum Interestingness constraint.  
V. CHD DATA EXTRACTION 
The data used in this experiment is derived from the HIS 
system database of China-Japan Friendship Hospital. In order 
to improve the quality of the model, this paper selects 18 
properties which are given by TCM experts as differentiation 
correlative factors. The doctor’s diagnostic behaviors are 
regarded as symptoms in accordance with the combination of 
deficiency in origin and excess in superficiality. Therefore, the 
purpose of mining association rules is to mine those patterns 
that the property values can lead to the emergence of certain 
symptoms. As the length of itemset increases, the support 
threshold decreases curvilinearly according to a function under 
the given significance, so as to discover the combinations of 
more factors. Extracted differentiation factors of patients and 
diagnosis are shown in TABLE ?.

In order to mine the relationship between the patient's 
diagnosis and medication, this paper extracts the corresponding 
data from CHD database. Considering that the patients using 
western medicines as well as Chinese medicines are too much 
and not normative, so western medicine will be divided into 
several categories according to function and prescription 
composed by Chinese medicine will be classified into the 
corresponding prescription effectiveness in accordance with 
effectiveness . To encode the processed data, we finally get the 
table that can be mined. TABLE ? is the diagnosis-western 
medicine category table, and TABLE ?  is the diagnosis-
prescription effectiveness table.

A. Validate the Framework of FDSC 
This experiment is carried out on an IBMR52 notebook 
computer, 512M memory, 1.86GHz. Select Table 3-mining 
differentiation table to tests whether we can mine the 
combination of more differentiation factors. The parameters of 
decreasing support are set as follows: min=2, max=6, 
f(min)=0.3, f(max)=0.12, f(3)=0.27, minconf=0.65.  
According to the formula, we solve ? =0.634. Then we can 
solve support thresholds under each length of itemsets shown 
in TABLE 5.

In the traditional association rules, when the support 
threshold is set to 0.12, the number of generated rules is very 
large, and the truly meaningful rules are submerged and can not 
be effectively extracted. However, association rules of long 
itemsets can not be discovered with the high support. In this 
paper, the experiment of decreasing support has extracted a 
number of association rules, which can not be extracted in the 
traditional algorithm when support is set to 0.3.

• Framework of FDSBCI 
We select the data in TABLE ?. Diagnosis in TABLE ? 
is deleted and the data of western medicine categories is only 
selected. The object is that in the FDSBCI framework we test 
whether can have mined combinations of many western 
medicine categories which are “mutual influences”. 
Parameters are set as follows: min=1, max=4, IS=1. The 
obtained number of rules by the FDSBCI framework under the 
different decreasing support curves is shown in TABLE ?.

In the condition of bidirectional confidence, we select a 
number of obtained rules in the f (K) = 0.6*[(4-K)/3]^2 +0.2 
and these rules are given in TABLE ?.

From the above numbers of obtained rules, we can find that 
decreasing support can get many meaningful combinations. 
According to the actual problem, the parameters can be flexibly 
adjusted to meet the need of different data. In [6-8] the provided 
decreasing support is not precise enough and can not adjust 
decreasing curve according to the practical problems. Their 
main job is to give a decreasing support curve and how to 
improve the generation efficiency of frequent itemsets. From 
the obtained rules in this paper, we can see that all of the two 
proposed frameworks in this paper can mine meaningful rules. 
These frameworks not only verify the existing rules, but also 
discover some novel rules. These rules provide a better 
reference for clinical syndrome differentiation and medication. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
This paper focused on the deficiencies of traditional 
support-confidence framework and proposed a new association 
rules framework of fuzzy decreasing support. Through the 
coefficient adjustment, it can not only satisfy the traditional 
association rule mining, but also satisfy the associating rule 
mining with linear decreasing support or fuzzy decreasing 
support. Therefore, it has higher flexibility. On the basis of 
them, we proposed two kinds of improved frameworks and 
analyzed the significance of them. Experimental results showed 
that in the clinical diagnosis of TCM symptoms the manner of 
decreasing support would help to discover the meaningful 
syndrome differentiation with a combination of multiple factors 
and to reduce redundant rules of the shorter length of itemsets. 
In the combination of western medicine categories and the 
combination of prescription effectiveness, the improved 
frameworks proposed in this paper can mine combinations of 
many western medicine categories and compatibilities of many 
kinds of prescription effectiveness. So the frameworks 
proposed in this paper have important theoretical and practical 
significance, and are helpful to improve clinical differentiation 
ability and to discover new differentiation factors and to find 
medicine compatibilities between multiple drugs.
