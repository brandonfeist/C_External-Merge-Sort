I. INTRODUCTION
With the increasing development of information
technology and the continued large-scale of the data scale
various professions, the data mining technology is unceasingly
mature and develops gradually to the domain application
direction. Data mining is a kind of technology which extracts
the non-ordinary, implicit, unknown, potentially useful
information from the large-scale data [1, 2]. As the continuous
development of the cause of the sports information, the sports
field has accumulated large amounts of data, so it will become
a trend that data mining is applied to the data analysis in sports
field, especially competitive and adversarial sports. Data
mining's analysis methods are various, such as association rule
mining and clustering analysis. In this paper, association rule
mining as well as the improved Apriori algorithm are used to
analyze the technology movements in football games. The
correlation between movements therefore can be obtained, so
that the rate of shoot goals for the players will be enhanced,
which will provide a scientific basis for the training.
II. ASSOCIATION RULES AND ApRIORI ALGORITHM
Association rules, which reflect the mutual dependency and
the relatedness between matters, are an important, highly active
area of data mining. The extraction of association rules is to dig
out the interesting association or correlation between the item
sets in a large number of data. Apriori algorithm is the classical
algorithm of the model in association rules, and it is the
improved algorithm introduced by R. Agrawal et al [3] in 1994,
which is based on AIS algorithm. Apriori algorithm uses a
technology called "floor by floor search of the iterative
method," of which the basic idea is to use recursive layer by
layer approach. First, scan the database, resulting in frequent
item sets; and then Apriori-gen makes use of the connection of
the members of Lk-1 to produce candidates for frequent item
sets Ck, especially after the members' being pruned. The
supported numbers of each candidate frequent item sets

thereby can be calculated by scanning the transaction database.
According to the comparison with the user-specified minimum
supports, the item sets which are greater than the minimum
supports are combined into K number of frequent item sets Lk •
The algorithm shall be carried on until no candidate frequent
item sets are generated. As a result, all the frequent item sets
are combined.
The biggest advantage of the Apriori algorithm is that
algorithm's idea is relatively simple, which is based on
recursive statistic, generating frequent item sets. Although it is
easy to implement, the Apriori algorithm itself has a number
of disadvantages, such as:
(1) Multiple scan of the transaction database will come into
being. When a large number of transactional data are stored in
the database, each scan time will be very long. In this way,
their efficiency will be very low.
(2) A large number of candidate item sets will be
produced. The k-1 candidate sets produced by Lk-1 are
presenting exponential growth.
III. ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM
A matrix representation of the database is given, the
methods of which are following: item sets are arranged in
sequence and transaction sets are also ranked in order. Item
sets stand for row vector, while the panel stands for column
vector. If the i item set is in the} affairs, then the value of the}
row, and the i column in the matrix is 1, otherwise it is 0,
which will be accordingly called Boolean matrix of the
database. As is known from the analysis, anyone transaction
needs scanning only one time, and then a Boolean matrix [4]
corresponding to the database can be gotten.
For the inadequacies of Apriori algorithm, this paper
adopts Association Rules of Boolean Matrix Algorithm
(Association Rules Algorithm Based on Boolean Matrix,
abbrev. ARABBM), and gives the basic design ideas and
description of the algorithm. Compared with the classical
algorithm, the algorithm only scans the database once to
accelerate the speed of scanning the frequent item sets.
Boolean matrix is a good data representation; ARABBM
algorithm transmits the transaction database into a Boolean
matrix form and then stores in bits and finally saves a lot of
memory space; frequent item sets instead of candidate item
sets are directly generated by Boolean algorithm. Therefore,
on one hand ,bottlenecks problems of iteratively producing

frequent item sets shall be effectively solved improve the
efficiency of frequent item sets found; on the other hand, the
efficiency of frequent item sets' being found shall be improved.
A. The relevant definition and theorem
Definition 1 I={I j,I2, ... .L} is a collection of items,
D={Dj,DJ, ... ,Dm} is a collection of services. Given minimum
support min_sup, then the minimum support several
min_supth = min_sup x m. The entire database can be
represented by Boolean matrix, namely:
A mn= a2j a22··· a2n
IV. ASSOCIATION MINING OF THE COMMON TECHNIQUES IN
FOOTBALL MATCH
Here is an example to illustrate how to use the algorithm to
dig out the most common technical movements among football
match association process with ARABBM. Five common
goal-data connected with football match technical movements
(similar to mass data mining process) is shown in Table 1,
namely I = {L, 12, 13, L, I5} , I, is on behalf of the technical
action steal, 12 -shots district 2, 13 -the dribble breakthrough,
I.j~midfield attack, 15 -Positioning the ball. D = {D), D2, D3,
D.j, D5} , if the minimum support min_sup = 30%, minimum
confidence level ofmin_conf= 40%, transaction number m = 5,
then the minimum supports several min_supth = 2.
Table 1 football match technical movement transaction data
Scan Boolean matrix A'5.j, as in

1 1 1 1 (2)

1 1 1 0
Seek the matrix of all 2-item sets vector inner product to
obtain the corresponding supports:
{II,I2}.supth=1 xO+Ox 1+1 x 1+0 x 1+1 x 1=2
Similarly, {L, I3}.Supth = 2, {L, I5}.Supth = 1, {I2, I3} .
Supth = 3, {I2, I5}.Supth = 3, {I3, I5} . Supth = 2. Because of
{Ij, I5}.Supth <2, {I], I5} belongs to non-frequent item sets.

o 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
o 1 001

(2) Scan Boolean matrices A55, seeking frequent 1- item
sets. The supports can be obtained by vector in each project
(element values in each column of the boolean matrix):
Ij.supth = 3, I2.supth = 4, Ij.supth = 3, I.j.supth = 1, Ij.supth = 3.
Because I.j.supth <min_supth = 2, {I.j} belongs to non-
frequent item sets. The corresponding vector A.j is to be
removed of the project L in the Boolean matrix A55• Therefore
frequent 1 - item sets collection can be obtained: L1 = {{I j},
{I2} , {I3} , {I5} } .
ml a m2' .. a mn
Where each column represents the project, aij(l~i~m, 1
0~n) is satisfied: if the item Ij(j~n) in the transaction Di(i
~m) appears, note the aij=l, otherwise aij=O. The definition of
item Ij vector [5] for the Aj={ajj,a2j;·· ,amj} , then the item Ij
support recorded as ~.supth=ajj+a2j+···+amj .
Definition 2 K item sets {L, Ij ; · · , Ik } of the vector inner
product is expressed as Aij···k=Ai/\Aj/\ ... /\Ak=( ali/\alj/\ ...
/\ ajk' a» /\ a2j /\ ... /\ a»- ... , ami /\ amj /\ ... /\ amk), Where
" /\" presents logic and computing. K item sets {L, Ij ; · · , Ik} 's
supports are recorded as {L, Ij; · · , Ik}.supth = ali/\alj/\ .•. /\
a., + a» /\ a2j /\ ... /\ a» + ... + ami /\ amj /\ ... /\ amk. If the
supports of the numbers in K item sets are not less than the
minimum support counts , then the set is called frequent item
sets.
Theorem 1 A non-frequent item sets must be either a
superset of the non-frequent item sets.
Theorem 2 If in the K item set X={ 11, 12, ••• , Ik }there
exists j E X so that ILk-1G)I<k-1, then X is not a frequent item
sets. Wherell.j., G)lrepresents frequent (k-1) a collection of the
numbers ofj contained in the item sets Lk- 1•
Proof: Suppose X is a K-dimensional frequent item sets,
then it's K a K-1 dimensional subset are in Lk-1• In K-1
dimensional subset generated by x, each item j E X there were,
K-1 times, j EX, arelLk_ 1G)I>k-1, with contradiction conditions,
therefore, X is not a frequent item sets.
Theorem 3 [6] For a collection of frequent K item sets Lk,
if ILkl<k+1, the number of frequent item sets in the largest
mining transaction database is k. Where, ILkl refers to the
numbers of frequent item sets K in the Lk.
According to Theorem 1 to Theorem 3, the candidate item
sets can be effectively cut, and the redundant item sets can
also be eliminated. It is more efficient than Apriori algorithm
to frequent item sets.
179
So frequent 2- item sets set is described as follows:
L2={ {II,I2},{lj,13},{12,13},{12,lj},{13,lj}} 0
(3) According to Theorem 2, the appearing numbers of
every item in L2 are calculated as follows, IL2(l j)1=2, IL2(12)1
=3, IL2(13)1=3, IL2(lj)I=2. Since the appearing numbers of
these items are not less than 2, corresponding vectors need not
to be deleted in the Boolean matrix A'j4.
(4) Seek all 3- item sets vector inner product in the
Boolean matrix A'j4 to obtain the corresponding supports:
{l j,12,13} .supth=2, {lj,12,lj} .supth- l, {l j,13,lj}.supth=l,{12,I3,lj}.
supth=2. Owing to the supports is less than the minimum
support in the project set {II, 12, Ij} " {II,I3,lj}, so they have
non-frequent item sets. The collection of Frequent item sets 3-:
L3={ {lj,12,13},{12,I3,lj}}.
According to Theorem 3, because IL31<4, when algorithm
is over, all the frequent item sets are as follows:
L={ {Ij},{12},{13},{Ij}, {lj,12},{l j,13},{12,13},{12,lj}, {13,lj},
{l j,12,13}, {12,13,lj}}.
Take the formed association rules frequent 3- item sets {L,
12, 13} for example, the relationship among the technical
movements represented by {II, 12,13} shall be illustrated.
Ij--'1213, 12--'Ij13, 13--'Ijl2 ' Ijl2--'13 ' Ijl3--'12 ' 1213--'
I, confidence degrees are as follows:
Confidence (Ij--' 1213) =2/3=70%
Confidence (12--'Ij13) =2/4=50%
Confidence (13--'Ij12) =2/3=70%
Confidence (l jl2--'13) =1=100%
Confidence (l jl3--'12) =1=100%
Confidence (1213--'L) =1=100%
They all meet the minimum level of confidence: min_conf
= 0.4 = 40%.From the above ,we can know that during the
excavation process the transaction data table the most
commonly used technical moves are Ij (steals), 12 (2 area shot),
13 (the dribble breakthrough) and their combinations, and they
are to meet the threshold min_sup and min_conf. Of these
combinations, Ij--'1213 indicates that the football player "steal"
the other side ball which is followed by at least 30% of
support and 70% of confidence, then the player will use "the
dribble breakthrough" technical action to shot from the
Stadium 2 area, which easily lead them to kick the ball into the
other goal.
Use the same methods to deal with all the possible formed
association rules, which will provide guidance for the players
to focus on the technical movement exercises, thereby
enhancing the rate of shoot goals.
v. CONCLUSIONS
This article describes the data mining of association rules
mining, and discusses the application of the improved mining
algorithm in the most commonly used movements of kicking
180
goals in football match. Moreover, common association
relations of the technical movements will be extracted, which
provides a decision for coaches to train and guide the football
players. It makes it an important tool to enhance the level of
competition by applying data mining technology in football
match.
