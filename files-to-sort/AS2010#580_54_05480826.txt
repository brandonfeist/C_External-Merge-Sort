I. INTRODUCTION 
Association rule is an important research in 
data mining and was first introduced by Agarwal 
and other researchers. This rule is used to find the 
relationships between items of the transaction 
data sets in order to provide reference for 
decision-making. The traditional algorithms of 
association rules consider that rules in the 
database is permanently effective. However, 
because the transaction data sets usually have the 
time characteristics, the rules change greatly with 
time. To set up a Meta-association rule for the 
rule is more intuitive to describe the tendency of 
rule changes and is better for decision-making. In 
order to describe the regularities of changes over 
time in association rules, Liu preliminarily 
introduced the new technology of dynamic 
association rules in reference [1]. This article, 
which is based on the fact that rules change with 
time, introduces the definition of Meta-rules of 
dynamic association rule, and uses integrated 
method such as AR-Markov models to mine the 
Meta-rules of dynamic association rule.

III. INTRODUCTION OF THE 
META-ASSOCIATION RULES FOR DYNAMIC 
ASSOCIATION RULE 
From the chapter 1.1, we can see that the 
dynamic association rules can be described by 
four parameters, the support vector?  vector 
confidence ? support and confidence. We 
establish the meta-association rules of dynamic 
association rules to predict the possible value of 
the support and confidence in the next state. At 
present, the method to propose the establishment 
of a meta-association rules are those based on 
probability and statistics is proposed in reference 
[6]. We propose one method which based on 
AR-Markov model, detailed steps are as follows: 
1) The CV series {
1 2
, , ,
n
f f f } as original 
series { tx }? t=1,2,…,n?? pre-process the data in 
order to get normal and zero-mean time series, 
when {xt} is the stable and non-mean time series, 
then estimate the average of { tx } and take the 
zero treatment. 
2) test?selection and estimation of the model 
parameters. First of all, take AR(1) as the 
suitable Model, Estimate the AR model 
parameters and get the models of every order 
according to the least square method. Finally, 
select the minimum-order of AIC value. 
3) use AR to predict the fitting value of the 
actual series , and by calculating the difference 
between fitting value and the actual value, as 
well as the percentage of the difference. 
4) conduct state division to the difference 
percentage according to the forecast results of 
support frequency, growth of the support vector 
series and Markov chain analysis methods. 
5) Calculate the probability ijP  of each state 
transferring to any other state through the theory 
that frequency is close to probability, and then 
get a one-step transition probability matrix P and 
k-step transition probability matrix P(k). 
6) forecast the next state through one step 
transition probability matrix, that is to forecast 
the k-th state through the k-step transition 
probability matrix. Through the forecast, we can 
get the probability of the k-th value. 
7) We take the median value of the state 
transition interval as the final forecasted value. 
IV. EXAMPLE ANALYSIS 
This paper modifies the algorithms of 
dynamics association rules in documents[2] and 
2132
   
then applies it to the sale database of a 
supermarket in years 2006 and 2007, and finally 
gets the rule, A?B, which means, a customer 
buys A on the premise of purchasing B, then the 
support count of every month in these two years,

167,171,164]? and establish the AR-Markov 
model , investigate the trend of rule changes, and 
predict the support count of the rule in 2008. 
steps: 
 1)Take the given series as the original 
series{xt}?t=1,2,…,24??  and establish the AR 
model

aV =38.2765?and AIC=90.8967 reached the

,0.0539,-0.0415,0.3362,0.5307] 
2)We use the model to fit the data in 2007 
and then get table 1, the data in the table is the 
actual value, forecast rule of support counting  
and the difference percentage in 2007.

12 164 172 4.878 E4 
The data in the table shows:  the forecasted 
average error got through AR model in 2006 is: 
-0.1886%, and the maximum error in the year is: 
7.2368%, so the result of AR model forecast is 
acceptable. 
3)According to the forecast results of support 
frequency and  Markov chain analysis methods,  
it is divided five states based on  percentage : 
state E1: the percentage is less than -8%; state 
E2: percentage is greater than -8% and less than 
-2%; state E3: the percentage is greater than -2% 
and less than -2%; state E4: percentage is greater 
than 2% and less than 8%; state E5: Percentage 
is greater than 8%.  the state of forecast 
difference between the percentage is shown in 
table 1. 
 4) Calculate the state transition probability 
to determine state transition matrix. From the 
analysis we can see that the rule in 2006 for the 
state transition is shown in table 2: 
TABLE II. STATE TRANSITION IN 2007 
from table 2 we can get one step transition 
probability matrix

can get the probability of every possible state for 
the support counts of the rules on the first 
quarter of 2008, that is shown as table 3: 
TABLE III.  PROBABILITY VALUE ON THE SUPPORT 
COUNT OF THE RULE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 
6) select the median value as a final forecast, 
the forecasting results of the rule's support count 
in  the first four months of 2008 are as shown 
in table 4.

March [168,178] 173  0.4515 
 From Table 4, we can see that with the use 
of this model, we can get the forecast range of 
the January 2008 is [159,166], the median 
forecast is 163, but with the direct use of AR 
model, the value we get is 168, and the actual 
value is 162, it indicates that the value got from 
direct use of the model is more reliable than that 
from the AR model. This model applies to large 
fluctuations and more random forecast of 
original data. We have used determining state 
range based on time-series forecast and 
combined with Markov process to amend the 
value of fitting time series simulation, which 
will not bring about greater Markov forecast 
error, and the data got when such applications 
are mixed shows that the accuracy is better than 
a single use of time-series model. Table 4 also 
shows the support for the rule in the next three 
years on the rise. According to the median 
forecast and the probability of state which are 
proposed by AR-Markov model we can grasp 
the future change trends of support for dynamic 
association rule. 
V.  CONCLUSIONS 
This article is based on  reference [1, 2] , 
has put forward the concept of dynamic 
association rules, introduced the definition of 
Meta-association Rules for dynamic association 
rule, put forward a AR-Markov model based 
mining method for meta-association rule of 
dynamic association rules. The mining method   
overcomes the shortcomings of big differences 
or uneven distribution in data got from static 
association rule mining algorithms. The results 
of the example in this paper shows that  the  
fitting accuracy and forecast accuracy of 
forecasts are much higher. This model is suitable 
to be used to mine meta-association rule when 
there is much historical and irregular data. We 
can more accurately grasp the trend of rules 
change through fitting the trend of rule changes 
and forecasting the future data, so that the 
dynamic association rule mining will get the 
more accurate results under the guidance of 
reasonable meta-association rule.
