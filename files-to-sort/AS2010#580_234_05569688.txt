Abstract—The routine Cyclic Association Rules and its upgrading 
alternatives were found with some problems as these:Some 
disadvantage of technique that compartmentalize a cycle into 
several time segments; The basic arithmetic use Apriori 
Arithmetic ,Their disadvantage are huge the candidate items and 
low-level efficiency. In regard to these problems, a new Cyclic 
Association Rules method was discussed. The new approach 
addressed these problems by adopting different methods.It chose 
the time sequence vector consists of the support of item to cluster, 
and using DB Index to determine the Optimal Class Number of 
Cluster, accordingly confirm well and truly time segments of 
cycle. And we introduced Cyclic FP-tree(CFP-tree) to discover 
Cyclic Association Rules, Cyclic FP-tree based on FP-tree 
arithmetic,FP-tree arithmetic excelled evidently Apriori 
arithmetic, CFP-tree handle cycle clipping technology based on 
conditional FP-tree to improve markedly efficiency of arithmetic. 
The findings tested Data Set of high-dimensional industrial 
authenticity. The findings prove the efficiency of the new 
approach in a broad scale.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The research on time segments of cyclic association rules 
started in the early stages at home and abroad. Such as the 
discovery of Temporal Constraint Association Rules made by 
Ou-yang wei-ming[1], but he did not discuss the Cycle 
Association Rules. The paper [2] by OzdenB raised Cyclic 
Association Rules is determined by man, the users use their 
experience to give a unit of time and cycle length (time units 
for the integer multiple). Then Cycle Association Rules are 
solved in line with the affairs existed in these time segments. 
This often brings about that the division of time segment is not 
very accurate, and it is more likely to miss a number of Cycle 
Association Rules. So far, the problems of the existing Cycle 
Association Rules discovery arithmetic are mentioned in details 
as bellow.  
A. The choice of time segment data 
For the problem of paper [2] by Xu min has raised a new 
discovery model on Cycle Association Rules [4][5] . Through 
clustering analysis, a cycle is divided into time segments which 
have different lengths, thereby Cycle Association Rules can be 
discovered more accurately. However, this discovery model of 
Cycle Association Rules choose the number of affairs which 
occur every moment as the characteristic point of time 
segments data to cluster, the clustering is carried out for 
services, and projects have their own distribution, this 
clustering approach can’t reflect the laws of individual projects. 
We set an example to illustrate, for a period of time, 0:00 to 
14:00 of each day are showed in Figure 1, for example, in text 
[4][5] ,according to the number of affairs occurred in each 
moment we can cluster the affairs occurred in the time segment 
of 1~5,6~12 into the same category. Each time clustering 
occurred in the number of items 3-8 for each segment in terms 
of time A moment occurred in the number of projects 
(including the number of projects  A’s affairs) can be clustered. 
In the time segment 3-8, A support project is 66% ,In the time 
segment 1-5,A support project is 41.3%,In the time segment 6-
12,A support project 38.6 %.If the minimum support is 54%, 
according to the text [4][5] the clustering method can not be 
found that this method is the frequent, However, Project A 
clustering by the number of items that occurred each time can 
be found frequently. 
Although the cluster according to the occurred affairs every 
moment can solve the problem in the text [4][5], it is still has 
problems. Because this cluster only consided that the number 
of projects took place every moment and ignored the total 
number of services occurred every moment. While the number 
of projects are the same between the two moments, the total 
number of services between two moments might be different 
and make the support of the two projects different. However, 
only support for the project each moment can truly reflect and 
decide whether it is frequent or not. Therefore, clustering 
according to the project is an one-sided consideration of the

number of project took place in every moment ,it can’t reflect 
inherent laws of the degree of support each moment. So, we 
continue to set an example of the situation in Figure 1 to 
illustrate the problem. In the Figure 1,because according to the 
number of the occurring items that the time between 3-8 is a 
kind of clustering, if the minimum support changes to 72%, in 
such a case, the time between  3-8 is not  frequent. But if we 
cluster by the ratio between the number of services every time 
and the total numbers of the occurring services at that moment, 
the 6-8 time segment can clustered into one category which its 
program’s degree is equal to 75%,so the program A in the 6-8 
time segment is frequent. However, program A can be found 
frequently in accordance with the degree of the program 
support every time. If clustering in accordance with the number 
of the occurred programs every time will be missing the 
frequent in the 6-8 time segments.

B. Define the number of the cyclic time segment 
In text [2-5] there is another issue, how many segments is 
divided in a cycle is determined by man.Although in the text 
[4][5] the length of time segment of the cyclic association 
rules’ model cluster automatically in accordance with the 
number of affairs , but this cluster is got from result of the 
Fisher arithmetic in the identified number of time segments by 
man. This ignores the cluster number which is another indicator 
to determine the effect of clustering. However, the choice of 
the cluster number is according to the actual situation of detail 
data rather than decided by man.  
C. The choice of basic arithmetic 
In text [2-5][10] the existing Cyclic Association Rules are 
based on Apriori arithmetic, Text [1] : cyclic association rules 
discovery arithmetic with temporal constraints. They all have 
problems such as existence of a very large set of options, match 
models and database services to your search costing lot of time, 
high consumption of resources, and low operating efficiency 
and so on.  
D. The idea to solve the existing problems 
The Arithmetic of Discover Cyclic Association Rules 
Based on Difference Sequence Arithmetic Clustering(CARCFP) 
consists of two phases: Difference Sequence Arithmetic 
Clustering (DSAC) and Cyclic FP-tree(CFP-tree). First of all, 
time series vector made up of the support of the items use the 
clustering based on difference sequence arithmetic [7] and DB 
Index [9]to determine each time segment dynamically in the 
Cyclic association rules. Using DB Index [9]to control the 
number of cluster can achieve the best results. We use DSAC 
to discover the useful association rules if it is possible. CFP-
tree which is based on FP-tree to discover the Cyclic 
association Rules for the database on each time segment of the 
cyclic. FP-tree is superior to the Apriori arithmetic. CFP-tree 
based on the conditions of the cyclical nature of FP-tree crop 
technology increases in the efficiency of the arithmetic 
substantially. The theory and experiment shows the CFP-tree 
arithmetic of the cyclic association rules based on FP-tree is 
much better than the arithmetic of the cyclic association rules 
based on Apriori in the efficiency both in time and space. 
II. DSAC 
A. Choose the feature point of the time segment’s data  
In this paper, the feature point of the time segment’s data is 
defined in details bellow: 
1) the support of every item occurred every moment in one 
cyclic can constitute each one-dimensional weight of the time 
series vector ei. N-dimensional time series vector 
ei=<x1,…,xn>, each dimension of ei range from all real 
numbers of the closed interval[0,1]. 
2) The time series vector sequence consisted of the time 
series vector is expressed as E={ei|i=1,…,m},the length of the 
time series vector sequence Lend(E)=m,Time(E) is to be a 
cyclic. The time interval between the any two time series 
vector of the E is equal, Granularity (E) is an accurate data.. 
In the paper, the DSAC arithmetic is mainly clustering the 
time series vector sequence E of the first cyclic. 
B. The preparation before the time series vector is clustering 
We are in face of the problem that how many kinds of the 
time series vectors can be categored in a cyclic to achieve the 
best clustering results before the time series vector is 
clustering. In another word, what are the  indicators to 
determine the best clustering results. 
1) Clustering validity function[11-13] 
we need clustering validity function to control the  number 
of the cluster to solve the above problem. Here we use DB 
Index to control the number of the cluster. The smaller the 
value of the DB Index?the better is effect of the cluster class. 
2) Optimization of the DSAC arithmetic---decrease the 
research range of the best number of the cluster Copt 
There are n time series vector e in a cyclic ,we can choose 
the number of the cluster e from 2 to n, apply DB Index and 
Difference Sequence Arithmetic to determine the best optimal 
class number of the cluster Copt. If the research range of the 
cluster class e is from 2 to n, in another way 2<= Copt<=n. So 
                                                                                                                                          2061
the theory in the text [14] is applied to this paper,So the paper 
take rules: nc ?max  , so that  2<= Copt<= n . 
C. Difference Sequence Arithmetic [7] 
Each moment of the time series vector ei in the first cyclic 
is clustered, this vector with time parameter is an ordered 
sample, we can use Fisher Arithmetic. Text [4][5] use this 
arithmetic to cluster the number of the items every moment. 
But Fisher Arithmetic doesn’t consider the order of the sample 
when it is in the calculation of the diameter of each category. 
About this order we can take Difference Sequence Arithmetic 
to cluster the time series vector ei. Difference Sequence 
Arithmetic not only consider the order of the sample with time 
parameter ,but also calculate simply and the result is intuitive. 
D. DSAC 
Difference Sequence Arithmetic can not determine that how 
many classes can be categoried to be the best optimal class, so 
we need DB Index to decide the optimal class of the cluster. 
The paper combines these two methods to cluster the time 
series vector ei in the first cyclic so that we can determine the 
distribution law of the feature point of the time segment’s data, 
and then to determine each time segment of the Cyclic 
Association Rules. 
DSAC Arithmetic: 
1) Step 1:calculate m-1 difference degree g[i] of the time 
series vector sequence with m time series vector in a cyclic and 
m-2 second difference degree h[i],then they can form 
corresponding the difference degree and the minor difference 
degree of the array. 
2) Step 2:because the class of the time series vector 
sequence E is from 2 to m . So we find m split point. In the 
second difference degree sequence array, we can find the max 
h[i], then determine the corresponding split point , then find the 
h[i]max in the remaining h[i] and determine the corresponding 
split point, do as this. Avoiding to scan the found h[i] 
repeatedly we can sort. Exchange the h[i]max and h[0] in the 
first place. Then exchange the second maximum h[i] and h[1] 
in the second place ,always do this until the m >h[i]. 
3) Step 3:because of sort the initial position of each h[i] is 
disrupted, if we want to find h[i] to determine the split point, 
we must write down the initial position. h[i] contains two 
components of the structure variable. h[i].data is the second 
defference degree. The position of h[i].place store the initial 
position i. 
4) 1st step of the step 2:to determine one h[i],according to 
h[i].place take advantage of the formula we can determine the 
position of the split point k_wei, then put k_wei into the 
corresponding position in Fen with sort from min to max. when 
k_wei is in Fen it still keep the order. 
5) 2nd step of step 2:when a new split point is determined, 
take the new Fen and INDEX(e.Fen)to calculate the 
corresponding DBe, then compare DBe and DB*. If DBe < 
DB*, DBe covers DB*,at the same time we can find DBemin 
when Fen run end. The smaller DBe is, the better effect of the 
cluster. Of course, the corresponding list Fen is the optimal 
class. 
III. CFP-TREE 
We use DSAC Arithmetic to cluster the time series vector 
which is consisted of the support of the occurred items every 
moment, and then determine each time segment of the Cyclic 
Association Rules. After this we can find useful cyclic 
association rules in each time segment of a cyclic. 
A. Two method to discover the frequent items of the cyclic 
1) Method 1: at each time segment of the any cyclic 
frequent items exist a corresponding frequent item to contain it. 
So we only scoop frequent itemsets of each time segment in 
one cyclic, then put this frequent items and services array of the 
time segment of the other cyclic into confrontation, so that we 
can find all cyclic frequent items. First we can build FP-tree in 
each time segment of the first cyclic, use FP-growth to produce 
frequent items of each time segment of the first cyclic, and then 
put these frequent items and services of corresponding time 
segment into confrontation to produce all cyclic frequent items. 
2) Method 2: we can do optimization of the method 2. 
According to the theorem 1, we can build FP-tree in each time 
segment of the first cyclic, start from the list of the cyclic 
frequent items L, use cyclical crop technology based on FP-tree 
to produce all cyclic frequent items ,and then discover the 
Lusty Cyclic Association Rules. It is CFP-tree. 
B. Cyclical crop technology based on FP-tree 
The detail idea of cyclical crop technology based on FP-
tree: do improvement of the FP-growth of the text [8], add the 
function to discover the cyclic frequent itemsets. On condition 
of model ? on FP-growth to do cyclical crop. The set 
combined with model ?and FP-tree(fo example, ?is {kma} , 
the condition of ?is FP-tree {(f:3,b:3)}|kma, soform the set 
{{fkma},{bkma}}) is compared with all services of 
corresponding time segment of the other cyclics, crop the 
itemset which its cyclical support < Smin in the set. When the 
FP-tree in each time segment [sj,ej] of first cyclic is finished 
,the whole cyclic frequent itemsets is done. 
We set the root on Figure 2 as an example, set Mis model 
condition of ma which involves items., under ma there are mac 
and maf MM ?? {f}{c} ? , so we can know from the theorem 3 
that the cyclic support of ma in Figure 2 , the cyclic support of 
all other mac and maf. so it is the mac and maf. In the child tree 
which take ma as root, the cyclic support of ma is max.If ma is 
not cyclical frequent items, except the root ma, is not the 
cyclical frequent itemset. If we use cyclical crop technology 
based on FP-tree of method 2 ,only root ma do need to be 
compared once to services array of the corresponding time 
segment of the other cyclic, so the child tree will not be formed 
in Figure 3. Compared to the method 1 ,method 2 can save the 
cost of child tree on condition of root ma, at the same time it 
can save the cost of the cyclical confrontation. On the condition 
that ma is not cyclical frequent items, method 2 can directly 
forms.Figure 3. Method 2 can control the extent of tree of the 
cyclic frequent items and decrease the research space. 
                                                                                                                                          2062

All the cyclic frequent items at every time segment [si,ei] of 
each cyclic can directly form Lusty Cyclic Association Rules. 
In details, on all not empty sets a in every cyclic frequent items 
L, if support(L)/support(a)>=cmin, the Lusty Cyclic 
Association Rules a?(L-a)[C,si,ei,sa?(L-a),ca?(L-a)]. 
IV. ARITHMETIC ANALYSIS AND THE RESULTS OF 
THE EXPERIMENT 
1) Hardware / software platform of experimental test and 
the parameters:S240XP Server(double Intel Xeon MP CPU, 
1GB Memory. Programming language VC++6.0,Operating 
system Windows2000AdvanceServer,Database Oracle9i.  
2) The Data Set of experimental:Gathering 600000 
pretreatment Data Set of high-dimensional industrial 
authenticity each day. One day is one cyclic. Time Series 
vector Sequence E experienced the time span Time(E)=a day. 
Granularity (E)=one second. The types of the gathering sample 
Lend(E)=86400, so Cmax= 294Lend(E) ? .people can get Copt 
                                                                                                                                          2063
=95 after DSAC algorithm cluster. Copt =95 is feasible after 
the estimation of the validity function DB Index. 
Figure 4 shows the number of the items based on CARCFP 
are larger than those based on Fisher at the same min support 
and total time length. It proposes that CARCFP algorithm is 
optimizer than the cyclic association rules model of the text 
[4][5]. Because the algorithm of the text [4][5] can discover 
more cyclic association rules than the algorithm of paper [2], so 
CARCFP algorithm is optimizer than the paper[2].

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The CARCFP can discover useful cyclic association rules 
as many as possible. Time and space efficiency get great 
improved when it is compared with the arithmetic of discover 
cyclic association rules based on Apriori. The paper analyzed 
and summarized some inherent nature and laws of the cycle 
association rules, and the experiment has reflected it. All 
experiments indicate that CARCFP is applied to analysis the 
cyclical database of the industrial production. The actual 
research results of CARCFP as these: The system of industrial 
embedded information collection and decision-making has 
been put into pre-operational phase. These above provide a 
certain reference on practical application of cyclic association 
rules and further theoretical research. However, there is another 
more complex problem of the cyclic association rules waiting 
for us to do Further exploration and research, that is the field of 
the maintenance of cyclic association rules. this problem is 
about incremental update of cyclic association rules. It needs to 
consider the number of diversification of items in the database 
of each cyclic and the threshold of cyclic support.
