Abstract
Server virtualization is the masking of server 
resources, including the number and identity of 
individual physical servers, processors, and 
operating systems, from server users. However, the 
problem of tuning dynamic resource allocation is a 
novelty. Managing heterogeneous workloads running 
within virtual machines is an interesting and 
challenging topic of server virtualization. This 
research applied association rule discovery, which 
is one of the data mining techniques to predict 
level of user access. The results illustrate that 
performance of the predictive model for a proxy 
server is 86.86%.  The performance of the predictive 
model for a web server is 87.18%. Additionally, user 
behaviors for proxy and web servers are visualized. 
The results suggest that user behaviors are different 
in term of workload, day and time usage.  This 
preliminary study may be an approach to improve 
management of data centers running heterogeneous 
workloads using server virtualization. 
1. Introduction 
 
Nowadays, the trend towards green computing is 
increasing. Green computing is defined as “the study 
and practice of using computing resources 
efficiently”. Server virtualization on user behavior is 
one of the approaches toward solutions. 
Virtualization of server resources is a method of 
running multiple independent virtual operating 
systems on a single physical computer.  It is a way of 
maximizing physical resources to maximize the 
investment in hardware and also a way of achieving 
higher server density. The concept of server 
virtualization can reduce the number of physical 
machine servers. 
When the number of servers is reduced, it reduces 
energy costs. The personnel cost will also be 
decreased. It is an easy-care system.  
In this paper, we propose to use association rules 
for predicting user behavior of heterogeneous 
workloads. In addition, user behaviors on proxy 
servers and web servers are visually compared. 
     The paper is structured as follows: related works

2. Related Works 
 
Currently, numerous researchers are interested in 
the virtualization technique. Management of work 
load includes: Steinder et al. [6] explored  the use of 
server virtualization technology in the autonomic 
management of data centers running a heterogeneous 
mix of workloads. Máy?ski et al. [4] analyzed the 
influence of virtualization mechanisms of pSeries 
servers on dynamic resources and partition load 
manager utilities. Park et al. [5] identified some 
design considerations for constructing and managing 
clusters and proposed architectures to support 
clustering.     
Examples of research related to energy cost 
reductions are: Tick et al. [7] emphasized in the cost 
reducing effect of the ITS application on server 
virtualization through two case studies. Khanna et al. 
[3] showed monitoring of key performance metrics 
and used the data to trigger migration of Virtual 
Machines within physical servers, and used 
algorithms that attempt to minimize the cost of 
migration and maintain acceptable application 
performance levels.  
Research related to the field of improved 
virtualization with varied I/O workloads includes:
Kang et al. [2] used the virtual machine-aware 
proportional share queuing scheduler, VM-PSQ, in 
server virtualization environments with different I/O 
requirements and priorities. 
Research related to association rules:  Wong et al. 
[8] used the time duration of each user session for 
predicting web access by fuzzy association rules. 
Yang et al. [9] used association rules for predicting 
when web page accesses will occur and comparing 
two different methods for temporal event prediction.

3. Server Virtualization with Mining 
Model
 
The traditionally heterogeneous workload 
management for server virtualization does not 
consider using in user behaviour. However, we 
believe that there are different both times and type of 
services in user behaviors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Shows the framework of system 
The Figure 1 shows the server virtualization system 
using data mining to predict user behaviors in 
management of heterogeneous workload.  This paper 
proposes primary studying user behaviors in several 
types of services and also studying behaviors for 
each period of times. We introduce new concept to 
improve management heterogeneous workload 
system, using data mining technique to predict user 
behaviors. 
4. Framework 
 
The study consists of 3 main steps. The Figure 2 
shows the framework of our system. The first step is 
data storage and preparation. After collected server 
log file and process of cleaning data have done, the 
number of user accesses is counted and defined level 
of the access. The second is creating a system model. 
Finally, the last step is testing the model to verify the 
performance of the system. 
4.1 Data Storage and Preparation 
     Data from proxy servers and web servers are 
collected. The Figure 3 shows the example of proxy 
server data.  The Figure 4 shows the example of web 
server data.  Typically, these access log files contain 
millions of records. Each record refers to a visit by a 
user to a certain web page served by the web and 
proxy servers. The data set contains one month and 
13 days. The log was collected from 00:00:00 
November 1, 2008 through 23:59:59 December 13, 
2008.

Figure 4. Example log file from web server
The number of user accesses in proxy servers and 
web servers are counted. After that, the frequencies 
of both the day of the week and the time are 
calculated. Then, levels of access are categorized 
into 5 levels: ‘1’ for low level; ‘2’ for medium low 
level; ‘3’ for medium level; ‘4’ for medium high 
level; and ‘5’ for high level. Here, the levels of 
access are assumed to be uniformly distributed.

4.2 Create a System Model 
 The relationship in the form of RHSLHS o  is 
applied for extracting rules. The extracted rules for 
LHS are based on days of week and 1-hour period 
time. 
Let D1, D2, …, D7 be days and T1,T2, …,T24 be 
time. However, we restrict the RHS as follows. Let 
L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 be the levels of user access for 
the RHS that can be predicted based on the term on 
the LHS. Therefore, a rule   kji LTD o, is created. 
Where kL occurs most frequently in the rows. 
  For each rule of the form RHSLHS o , we define 
the supp and conf as the support and confidence as 
follows.

Table 1 shows examples of rules for predicting 
the access levels on Monday and Tuesday at 
10:00 AM. Confidence and support value are used 
for rule selections. Because plenty of rules are 
generated, some simple concerns in rule 
selections include:  
 
 
1) Select the rule with maximum 
confidence. 
2) Select the rule with maximum support 
if confidence value is equal. 
3) Select the rule that happens first when 
confidence and support values are 
equal. 
 
Table 2. Prediction model of proxy server with 
confidence and support values. 
   
  From Table 1, some prediction rules include: level 
of user access from the proxy server on Monday 
at 10:00 AM is “Low”. Level of user access on 
Tuesday at 10:00 AM is “Medium”. 
Table 2 shows total association prediction model 
for proxy server with confidence and support values. 
 
4.3 Test model
 
 The performance of the model was tested. In 
general, the data is divided into a training data set 
and a test data set.  
 Data obtained in November for 30 days are used to 
train the model while data acquired for 13 days in 
December are used to test the performance of the 
model. Note that the ratio of the training set and 
testing set is 70:30. 
 An example of Table 3: model prediction using 
association rules on Monday 12.00 AM – 08:00 
AM, the level of user access for proxy server is 
“Low”. The rule is verified by the test model 
using the same day and time. The level of the 
user access is “Low”, which is corresponding to 
our generated association rule.  Therefore, the 
accuracy is marked as “T” (Testing model is 
accurate).

However, on Monday 10.00 AM., the model 
prediction using association rules indicates a 
“Low” level of user access. The rule is validated 
by the test model using the same day and time. 
Level of user access is “Medium High”, which 
does not correspond to our rules.  Therefore, the 
accuracy is marked as “F” (Test model is 
inaccurate). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
 
 The performance of the predictive model for the 
proxy server is 86.86%.   
Similarly, the performance of the predictive model 
for the web server is measured the same way as the 
proxy server. The results demonstrate that the 
accuracy prediction of the level of user access for the 
web server is 87.18%. 
 User behaviors corresponding to the workload and 
time are displayed as in Figure 5 and Figure 6. 
Figure 5 shows user access behavior for the proxy 
server. It can be seen that during 07.00 to 16.00, user 
accesses are more frequent than other times for each 
day of the week. Nevertheless, the accesses are lower 
on Saturday and Sunday than other days of the week. 
Tuesday seems to have the highest access during 
07.00-16.00 
 Figure 6 illustrates the user access behavior for the 
web server. It can be interpreted that during 08:00 to 
16:00, there are less frequent accesses than others 
time. More accesses appear after 16.00. According 
the graph in Figure 6, the access is peak on Monday 
at 19.00. 
In general, behavior of user access for web server 
is opposite to the proxy server. For example, high 
access in proxy server but low access in web server. 
This implies that the workload of user behaviors is 
different according to the time and type of servers.  
Understanding in user behavior could be used for 
workload management process.   
This technique can improve the performance of 
server virtualization and may reduce the number of 
machines running. For example, when the proxy 
server utilization is high, the web server utilization is 
low as in Figure 5 and Figure 6. It is possible to 
aggregate two types of these services to work 
together in the same machine. However, factors such 
as CPU load, memory, and other factors should also 
be considered.

6. Conclusions and Future work 
 
   This research applied association rules, one of 
the data mining techniques to predict level of user 
access for proxy and web server. The performances 
of the predicting model for proxy and web server are 
86.86% and 87.18%, respectively. Moreover, the 
visualization approach for the proxy and web server 
demonstrates that user behaviors are different by 
times and type of services. Understanding user 
behaviors may improve the efficiency of 
heterogeneous workload management. 
More work remains to be done. In the immediate 
future, we plan to investigate user behaviors focusing 
on data size for each period time. We also plan to 
study CPU and memory loads.
