I.  INTRODUCTION  
Immune algorithm is the computer model which 
combines with computer technology to solve practical 
problems, and it has got inspiration from biological system, 
so it is the combinatorial product of bio-immunology and 
computer science. In 1986, Farmal et al involved the concept 
of "Immune Algorithm" in one article called?The Immune 
System, Adaptation, and Machine Learning?. From then on, 
the study of immune algorithm has aroused the interest of 
more and more scholars in the international arena. In the 
twenty years, the results of these researches have been 
involved in data mining[1], network security[2], pattern 
recognition[3], combinatorial optimization[4] and so on. At 
present, the research of artificial immune algorithm is in full 
swing and still immature. There are still some questions to be 
deeper studied, such as the questions of early maturity and 
search efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Metropolis 
criterion of simulated annealing mechanism based on 
immune algorithm, which accepts ill-conditioned by a certain 
probability, consequently, the improved algorithm is better to 
escape from local extremum, improve the speed of 
convergence speed and avoid degradation etc. 
Association Rule Mining is an important branch of the 
research field in Data Mining, which is uesed to discover the 
related rules between different commodity(item) in the 
transaction database. These rules reflect behavior model of 
buying of customer, such as the impact of purchasing some 
merchandise. Since Agrawal et al firstly raised the issue of 
association rules mining in 1993[5], the study of this problem 
has gained considerable development in some aspects and 
proposed many mining algorithms. One of the most 
influential association rule mining algorithms is Apriori 
algorithm which is mostly as the core of the rest of 
algorithm, just to take into improvement and expansion. 
However, some of the existing algorithms still widely existe 
the questions of larger amount of calculation and lower 
efficiency of excavation etc, therefore, a fast and effective 
algorithm for association rules mining is urgently needed. 
Based on the above problems we try to introduce the MIA 
into the association rules mining. 
II. THE IMMUNE ALGORITHM BASED ON METROPOLIS 
CRITERION (MIA) 
A. Metropolis criterion 
Metropolis criterion is an importance sampling method 
proposed by Metropolis et al in 1953. In the simulated 
annealing algorithm the criterion of state changing from i to j 
is the corresponding transition probability, which can be 
expressed as: 
 
                                                                              ?1? 
 
Where ? = f(i)-f(j), f(i) and f(j) are the values of 
objective funcition in the state i and j; T is the temperature 
in the process of annealing, which is the control parameter; 
Pt(
ji? ) determines whether or not to accept the 
transition from the current solution i to new solution j. We 
generate a random number in range of [0 1] by using the 
number generator, when the value of Pt(
ji? ) is larger 
than the random number, the new state is important state 
and take the new state as the current state, or else give up 
the new state and accept the original state by a certain 
probability Pt. Then it iterative generates new state. 
B. The structure of MIA operator  
In this paper we carry out some improvement for the 
traditional immune operator, that is, introduce Metropolis 
criterion into the selection operation of immune algorithm. 
The improved immune operator is made up of two steps, 
which are vaccination and Metropolis selection. The former 
is to improve the fitness of individual, the later is to prevent 
the degradation of group and to accelerate the speed of 
convergence. The specific description is as follows: 
1)  Vaccination: Set up individual b ? Rn, b = (b1, ..., 
bn). Vaccinated to them means to amend some genes of the 
b according to the prior knowledge, so that individuals

could have the higher adaptation degree with the greater 
probability. These prior knowledge can be the probably 
value range of the optimal solution's some component, may 
also be certain restrictive relation between some component. 
Moreover, the operation should meet the following 
conditions: if b is already the best individual, b transfer to b 
with probability 1; if b is the worst individual, that is, every 
gene of b with is different from the best individual, b 
transfer to b with probability 0. Let the Groups B = (b1, ..., 
bN), Vaccinated to B is a sort of operation that randomly 
selected N? = ?N individuals according to a certain 
proportion ?(0 ? ? ? 1). The vaccine is extracted from the 
priori knowledge of the problem, and it contains information 
and its accuracy that play an important role on the efficiency 
of the implementation of the algorithm. 
2) Metropolis selection: That is, we test individual 
which was vaccinated. If the fitness of offspring is better 
than the generation of parent, it will enter into the next 
generation instead of the parent, which ensures the best 
individual of group to enter into the next generation; If the 
fitness of offspring is smaller than the generation of parent, 
which shows that the group has appeared  serious 
degradation in the genetic process, then this group enter into 
the next group by the probability Pt of the formula (1), that 
is, this can limited accept ill-conditioned while accepting the 
best individual, which ensures the diversity of group and 
avoids falling into the local extremum. 
3) The flow chat of MIA

4) The theoretical analysis and experimental 
verification of MIA 
a) The theoretical analysis of MIA: Metropolis 
criterion can limited accept ill-conditioned, the probability 
of acceptance of the ill-conditioned slowly tends to zero 
with the temperature decreased, which can make the 
algorithm may jump from the local optimum and find the 
global optimum solution as far as possible. In the early 
period of algorithm, that is, the temperature of system is 
higher, it can accept the new solution algorithm of no 
improvement by the higher probability, and can effectively 
avoid to fall into a bad situation in this period; In the later 
period of algorithm, that is, the temperature of system is 
lower, it can accept the new solution algorithm of no 
improvement by the lower probability, and can ensure the 
convergence of the algorithm while reducing the convergent 
time of algorithm. 
Therefore, through the theoretical analysis we can know 
theimproved algorithm can further solve the degenerate 
phenomenon of the current algorithm and improve the speed 
of convergence after introducing the Metropolis criterion. 
b) The experimental verification of MIA?In this paper, 
we carry out simulation test by using a traditional test 
function, the function is as follow: 
2)10sin( += xxy ?   x ?[-1 2]        ?2? 
This is a multi-peak one-dimensional variable function 
which is commonly used in the detection of evolutionary 
algorithm. In a given range, it has a number of local 
extremum, the maximum value f(1.85)=3.85. 
The simulations of IA and MIA are shown separately as 
follows Figure 2: 
 
 
Figure 2 The figure of simulation 
From the figure 2, we can see that the convergence 
speed of MIA is more quickly than IA; The average optimal 
value of MIA is 3.8468 while the average optimal value of 
IA is 3.8298; Compared with IA, the running state of MIA 
is more stable. 
Therefor, through the above we can know that the 
overall performance of MIA is better than IA.

 III. THE ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON MIA 
A. The design of coding 
transaction database is mainly used for the discovery of 
association rules, and some datas(that is, the values of 
attributes be interested by users) are the specific object 
application. Therefor, in this paper we adopt the method of 
real-coded. The real number is used to express the data (that 
is, antigen) which is disposed in data mining, and the 
antibody X is made up of a set of real numbers 
. Suppose that the fact table is composed of age, sex,income, 
occuption, category of commodity(where the age has five 
values, the sex has two values, the income has ten values, the 
occuption has twenty values, the category of commodity has 
thirty values), the range of coding is from 0 0 0 0 0 to 5 2 10 
20 30, where the attributes not chosed are expressed by the 
number 0. 
B. The structure of the fitness function 
The fitness is the sole basis of selection operation of 
immune algorithm, and it is the symbol of immune algorithm 
which is directed search different from random blind search. 
The fitness function react as bridge between optimization 
problem and immune algorithm, therefore, the design of the 
fitness function directly affects the performance and 
efficiency of immune algorithm when it solves practical 
problems. MIA must needs in accordance with the value of 
the fitness function when searching. Therefore, we must 
solve assessment question of individual in order to  assess 
the advantage and disadvantage of each individual. 
In the association rules mining, the rules discovered must 
meet some certain Conf(x) and Supp(x), that is, Conf(x) and 
Supp(x) are the two important parameters of association 
rules. Therefor, in this paper we take the fitness function as 
follows ?3?: 
                                            
Where Ws+Wc=1, Ws?0, Wc?0, Suppmin is the threshold 
of support, Confmin is the threshold of confidence. 
C. The algorithm steps of association rules mining based 
on MIA 
• Randomly generate value of each attribute, select 
this value by the probability i?  which takes zero, 
take the others values of attribute by the probability 
?1- i? ?, its range is an integer which is randomly 
chosed from one to the number of this attribute. 
When the corresponding selected probability i?  of  
some attribute is zero, this attribute must exist in 
association rules mining, and if i?  is not zero, then 
the corresponding attribute does not necessarily exist 
in association rules mining. Choose n original 
antibodies by circulation, the order of each attribute 
of these antibodies is the same while ensuring that 
each attribute meets the condition of the threshold of 
support. Thereout, the original group of antibody A0 
is formed. 
•  Calculate the value of fitness of each antibody 
according to the formula (3). 
• If the current group has included the optimal solution 
(that is, the antibodies which have been got meet the 
minimum support and minimum confidence at the 
same time), the algorithm output the antibodies, 
revert them to the original values of attribute and 
interpret rules, but still restore them in the group. If 
the iteration numbers meet the condition of stop, the 
algorithm would stop running and output the result; 
Otherwise continue. 
• Extract the vaccines H based on the best antibodies 
which are generated. 
• Carry out mutation operation for the current group of 
father Ak, extract antibody from Ak by the 
probability of Pm, carry out mutation of real number 
for one or more attributes, randomly make them to 
others values of attributes by some probability; 
Carry out crossover operation for the current group 
Bk, in this paper we adopt discrete recombination 
rule. Delete the antibodies which do not meet the 
condition of support.  
• Carry out the operation of vaccination based on the 
best vaccines which are extracted. 
• Take the criterion of Metropolis selection for the 
antibodies which have been inoculated, if the fitness 
of offspring is better than the parent generation, it 
will enter into the next generation instead of the 
parent. If the fitness of offspring is smaller than the 
parent generation, this group enter into the next 
group by the probability Pt of the formula (1), then 
transferre to step two. 
IV. THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT  
In this paper, according to one thousand record datas of 
transaction of customers which are extracted in e-shopping, 
we conduct the corresponding mining of association rules, 
and discover the habit of customers who used to buy goods 
by using MIA. 
For some basic informations of customers and the names 
of commodities (that is, the fields of database), such as the 
customer's age, occupation, income and the category of the 
electronic commodity and so on, we express them by means 
of the real-code. Some values of the attributes  are encoded 
in the following table 1. 
In the experiment the parameters of algorithm are: the 
initial group is 50, the numbers of iteration are 100 times, 
the mutation probability Pm is 0.3, the crossover probability 
Pc is 0.5; The parameter Tk in the Metropolis selection 
meets the formula: Tk= ln[T0/k+ 1](where T0=100), the 
threshold of confidence is 70%, the threshold of support is 
4%. The evaluation criterion of excavation is category of 
commodity.

The part of rules which are excavated (where the attributes 
not chosed are expressed by the number 0): 
RULES: 
1 ? 0 ? 0? 30  support=6%,  confidence =73.58% 
1 ? 0 ? 3?  1  support=5%?confidence=80% 
…… 
Interpret these into the practical rules as follows:

[support=6%?confidence=73.58%] 
Age?X?20-39?? Income of year?30K-39K?? category of commodity?computer?[support=5%?
confidence=80%] 
…… 
In all, we can excavate eighteen rules, and this algorithm 
cost 10.204 seconds. 
From the result of the experiment we can see that this 
algorithm could effectively find most frequent sets and 
generate the association rules. These rules meet the actual 
conditions, thus show that this algorithm is effective and 
feasible when used in the association rules mining. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper we propose an improved immune 
algorithm(that is, MIA) through combining with the 
character of the simulated annealing mechanism. Compared 
with traditional IA, through theoretical analysis and the result 
of experiment, MIA can further solve the degenerate 
phenomenon of the current algorithm and improve the speed 
of convergence after introducing the Metropolis criterion; 
Then we try to use this algorithm to excavate association 
rules, propose a new algorithm of association rule mining. 
Through theoretical analysis and experimental results we can 
verify that the algorithm is feasible and effective.
