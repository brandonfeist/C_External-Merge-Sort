Biomedicine 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
With the technology development of research and 
measuring instruments in biomedical engineering, it becomes 
possible to record a huge amount of medical information 
precisely. This leads to the exploration of the medical data. The 
application of Hospital Information System (HIS) also makes it 
possible to build complete Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) 
which including not only objective physiological values and 
medical images, such as X-ray, Ultrasound B and CT, but also 
plenty of detailed patient’s background information, such as 
age, gender, height, weight and previous medical history. The 
characteristic of these data are: rich in classes, heterogeneity in 
essential and valuable for disease diagnosis, treatment, and 
research. However, it is far beyond the capacity and speed of 
traditional analysis to understand, analysis and deal with these 
information. This shortage becomes the bottle-neck of 
investigation and application in biomedicine. Biomedicine 
database existing the phenomenon of “data rich, information 
poor”. In order to solve the problem of Knowledge Discovery 
in Database(KDD) , a great importance has been continuously 
attached to the Data Mining(DM). Data Mining is a cross 
subject which covers machine learning, mathematical statistics, 
neutral network, database, pattern recognition, rough sets, 
fuzzy mathematics and relative technologies. The Data Mining 
in biomedical database can help us with disease diagnosis, 
treatment, research and decision making, by discovering the 
rules and mode of medical diagnosis. The research on building 
an experimental platform of syndrome differentiation research 
based on data mining technology is done by YAN Jun-feng. It 
expresses that implementing TCM(Traditional Chinese 
Medicine) diagnosis research taking the unified architecture of 
symptoms, syndrome elements and differentiation as a break 
through point, is an achievable objective[1]. 
II. SOME KEY ISSUES OF DATA MINING IN BIOMEDICINE 
DATABASE 
Data Mining is the process of abstracting unaware, potential 
and useful information and knowledge from plentiful, 
incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and stochastic data. The form of 
abstracted knowledge can be concept, rules, regulations, tends 
and mode. The implementation methods need both special data 
structure and algorithm. The algorithms of currently used data 
mining are: statistic method, decision tree, evolutionary 
algorithm, neural network, fuzzy logic, association rule, rough 
set, support vector machine and nearest neighbors algorithm. 
However, the particularity of data mining in biomedicine 
database is due to its privacy, polymorphism, incompleteness, 
timeliness and redundancy, which means that the method of 
doing this should differ a lot with that of regular ones. 
A. Preprocess of data 
Preprocessing of data mainly includes issues about 
shortage, redundancy, inconsistent and outdated of data 
through the methods of data cleaning, data transforming and 
data reducing. Biomedicine database needs data preprocessing 
because it always containing noise, incomplete, inconsistent 
data information. 
B. Anonymousness and identification transformation 
Besides data preprocessing, in order to separate the relative 
between patients and their records which may referenced some 
private information, anonymousness and identification 
transformation are also needed. 
C. Standardization of text data 
Standardization of text data is needed for mining 
biomedical information; otherwise, it will become hard to do 
data mining on experts’ explanation of images, signals or other 
kinds of clinical data. 
D. Information fusion technology 
Biomedicine database is composed by words, data, signals, 
images and some voice & video signals. Different technologies 
and measures should be taken to deal with these databases with

different physical properties, so that the results can be 
comprehended with convergent properties. 
Apart from above, key issues of data mining in biomedicine 
database also includes research on Fast Association Rule 
Mining (FARM), ensure the accuracy and liability of 
knowledge which is gained from data mining. In practical, in 
order to adapt to various requirements of projects, methods of 
data mining need modification, expansion and optimization. 
III. APPLICATIONS OF DATA MINING IN BIOMEDICINE 
DATABASE  
The purposes of data mining and knowledge discovery in 
biomedicine database is prediction and classification of 
diseases. The methods of intelligently categories and prediction 
are: Rough Sets Theory, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN), Association Rule, Evolutionary Computation 
and Multivariate Statistical. 
A. Rough Sets Theory 
The model of rule produces, which was based on rough sets 
theory, can automatic discover the knowledge about positive 
example and negative example of clinical trial databases 
automatically [2]. LI Nan used Automatic Judge Algorithm, 
which is based on rough sets theory, to test whether the tumors 
of lung is benign. The percentage of response of patients 91.3% 
with 100% accurate rate [3]. The problem of analysis of 
clinical data mining of echocardiography was solved by ZHOU 
Yi through the method of combining rough sets theory, cluster 
analysis and factor analysis [4]. The bottle-neck problem of 
knowledge acquisition from expert system was solved 
effectively by auxiliary method of medical diagnosis, proposed 
by QIU Yin-an based on rough sets theory and interval 
annihilation [5]. Favorable outcomes was gained from 
predicting chest pain, emergency diagnosis of ICU, identify 
diagnosis of lung cancer and rheumatoid types, diagnosis of 
breast diseases and premature birth, diagnostic classification of 
liver trouble and acute appendicitis, due to the research done by 
LI Qiong through data mining technology based on rough sets 
theory [6]. 
B. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
The relation between antipsychotic drugs and 
cardiomyopathy and myocarditis has been found by Coulter 
DM, with the help of Bayesian Neural Network 
Architecture(NNA) [7]. The classification of cardiac 
arrhythmia which can be life-threatening was done by Dokur Z 
using Neural Network Architecture (NNA) [8]. Vefghi L used 
Neural Network Architecture (NNA) to test the depth of 
anesthesia and control the consumption of anesthesia drugs [9]. 
C. Decision Tree 
After studying issues in automating cardiac SPECT 
diagnosing with decision tree, Sacha JP pointed out that Data 
mining and general knowledge discovery techniques appear to 
be useful for classification of SPECT cardiac images [10]. Cios 
KJ used decision tree to discovery knowledge for myocardial 
perfusion [11]. Decision tree algorithms was applied to the data 
mining of the mammography classification by WANG Shu-
yan, and proposed a medical images classifier based on 
decision tree algorithm, the experiment results were given [12]. 
ErnaKentala. once withdrew 6 kind of patient information from 
Helsinki University affiliated hospital's nose nerve expert 
system database ONE, established 6 kind of disease's different 
scale decision tree separately, and aimed at 6 trees to analyze 
alone affects factor which each kind of disease occurs, 
withdraw the diagnosis rule from the decision tree, thus expert 
knowledge transformed into valuable information for young 
doctors reference at any time [13]. Xu Lei reported that the 
decision tree data mining techniques can be used to grade the 
degree of disease, screening of risk factors, the decision to 
prescribe the size and choice of treatment prescription, etc [13]. 
D. Evolutionary Computation 
Evolutionary Computation is a new search and optimization 
algorithm which is developed with law of biological evolution. 
It contains genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, 
evolutionary strategy and genetic programming. Evolutionary 
Computation is aimed to make the region within the Search 
space which population evolved into become better and better, 
the method of realizing this is: starting from any population and 
go through the processes of random selection, crossover and 
mutation. Bojarczuk CC used genetic programming to diagnose 
diseases with the symptom of chest pains [14]. Wang ML used 
Evolutionary Computation to classified Spine scoliosis [15]. 
E. Association Rule 
With the help of Association Rule, after analyzing the clinic 
database, LI Xiao-hua found that the age of bronchial asthma 
patients fall into the region between 1 to 9, the main symptom 
are cough, shortness of breath and have contact allergy history 
of smell [16]. The Medical Image Analyzer, done by WANG 
Shu-yan, based on association rules, realized the data mining of 
breast cancer images with high accurate rate of classification 
[17]. CHEN Ming used Apriori algorithm of association rule to 
express the function of TCM diagnosis [18]. HE Wei and QI 
Ying applied this technology into Medical research projects 
[19]. 
F. Multivariate Statistical 
Combining the statistical method, computer technology and 
evidence-base medicine, TIAN Si-sheng developed a screening 
system of prescriptions and herbs in the clinical literature of 
TCM with high integrated and objective evaluation methods of 
multiply mathematical statistics and evidence-base medicine 
[20].The sub-health epidemiological data was analyzed firstly 
with the whole data understanding and then with variables and 
finally with choosing the appropriate model by LIU Bao-yan, 
Thus, the classification equation and the clinic characteristic of 
sub-health are obtained, two logistic regression models were 
established, each of which is tested using testing data set to 
reach the classification accuracy, and the results were satisfying 
which show that the main clinic characteristics are body 
fatigue, sleep difficulty, bad memory, work efficiency 
declining, mental blankness, irascibility, etc [21]. 
Apart from above, data mining technology can also be used 
in bioinformatics/ DNA analysis, analysis of patient flow, 
Hospital Pharmacy Drug Administration, Policy Analysis on 
medical, Medical Health Care and Evaluation of Medical 
Resource Utilization, etc.

IV. CONCLUSION 
Biomedicine database is a comprehensive database which 
contains Electronic Medical Record (EMR), medical images, 
pathologic parameters and assay eventuate. The current data 
mining technology is mainly applied to relational database, 
transactional database and data warehouse which are classified 
as structured database . Mining to complete data is at beginning, 
the possible causes of this phenomenon can be: poor 
understand, massive amount of mining results and unfavorable 
between practical mining method and interaction with 
users,etc. We believe that data mining technology will take 
great importance in dealing with biomedicine records, along 
with the extensive use of data mining technology, improvement 
and perfection of mining algorithm, combination specialty and 
complexity of biomedicine information and effective dealing 
with the key technology of mining. The application scope of 
data mining in biomedicine research, medical and health care 
management and decision will become wider and wider, and 
the economic and social benefits will become more and more 
considerable.
