I. INTRODUCTION 
Sub-health in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) indicates 
the intermediate state of human's physical status between 
health and disease, embodying the degree of hislher health. The 
sub-healthy state is interpreted by the TCM syndrome, such as 
Cold, Hot, stasis of blood, and so on. The TCM focuses on the 
recuperation of the individual's sub-health by conducting the 
available regimen which corresponds to the hislher TCM 
syndrome, while such regimen involves the food therapy, the

physical exercise, and so on. Sub-health draws a worldwide 
attention, and it is called as "Century Disease" because of its 
extensive society and special times. Therefore, in-depth study 
of sub-healthy state based on the TCM theory will make an 
important contribution to human medicine [1]. 
Generally, the sub-health state and the TCM syndrome is 
diagnosed by four kinds of diagnosis techniques, called Sizhen 
(derived from the Chinese lmiMsizhen]). Among them, the 
Wangzhen C?i?) by observing the object's aspect such as face 
and tongue to diagnose, and Wenzhen ([0] i?) by inquiring the 
object's physical status and feelings to diagnose are often used. 
It is obvious that such diagnosing ways are of sUbjectivity and 
the diagnosis results are influenced by the individual criteria of 
the TCM doctor, although helher is strictly trained by the TCM 
teaching course. Thus, because of the difficulty of 
understanding, the advantage of TCM in helping the people 
recuperating from sub-health is still not widely recognized and 
utilized now. Also, there are few papers in the literature that 
reported the achievements about the application of TMC in 
diagnosing individual's sub-health automatically and 
improving their sub-health state. 
With the objective to fully utilize the advantage of TCM in 
the recuperation of sub-health, and based on the assumption 
that the theory of TCM is reasonable and the TCM doctor has a 
perfect discrimination capability although the uncertainty in 
hislher diagnosis must be taken into account, this paper 
proposes an approach of automatically inferring the users' 
sub-healthy state and the corresponding TCM syndrome based 
on TCM's Wangzhen and Wenzhen, so as to construct a 
3717 
system which help them recuperating from sub-health by 
means of showing them the relevant recovery plans such as 
physical exercise, food therapy, music therapy and so on. After 
describing the system's mechanism briefly, this paper 
introduces the process of the data collection for training the 
inference model of the sub-healthy state and the TCM 
syndrome. For collecting such data set, the images of some 
subjects' face and tongue are captured and the data about the 
degree of their feelings and physical status at that time are 
recorded some times at an interval of about two weeks. Then, 
some TCM doctors are asked to give the sub-healthy state and 
the TCM syndrome of these subjects by observing the collected 
data. Further, the features extracted from the images of objects 
for inferring are also depicted. Next, the algorithm of mining 
association rules regarding the sub-healthy state and the TCM 
syndrome from the above collected data set is described, while 
it considers the individuality of TCM doctor's criteria in 
diagnosis. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the proposed method, and show the potential 
important role of the TCM in diagnosing people's sub-healthy 
state, and helping them to recuperate from it. 
The remains of this paper include the following parts. 
Section 2 describes the system's mechanism briefly; Section 3 
introduces the methods of data collection, human facial 
features' extraction, the scaling of the sub-healthy state, and the 
diagnosed results given by TCM doctors; Section 4 depicts a 
rule mining algorithm that integrates different TCM doctors' 
diagnostic information for inferring sub-healthy state and the 
TCM syndrome automatically; Section 5 shows the experiment 
results; And the last section gives the conclusions and the 
future work. 
II. SYSTEM'S MECHANISM 
In TCM theory, the sub-health indicates the intermediate 
state of the people between the health and the disease. It can be 
represented by the degree belonging to 3 factors called 
Heat/Cold, Interior/Exterior, and Deficiency/Excess, shown in 
Fig.I. The gray zone denotes the scope of sub-healthy state. 
Without the drug therapy, the individuals can be recuperated 
from the sub-health by the regimen such as natural food 
therapy, physical exercise, and so on. However, the sub-healthy 
state will become serious and transfer to the disease state if it is 
neglected. On the other hand, correspondent to these 3 factors, 
the TCM syndrome are categorized into 13 classes. They are 
cold, hot, deficiency of vital energy, stagnation of vital energy, 
deficiency of blood, stasis of blood, deficiency of jin, phlegm 
and excessive fluid, heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidney. They are 
often used by the TCM doctors in diagnosing and prescribing 
by Wangzhen, Wenzhen, and so on. The natures of many 
natural foods and medicines in prescription annotated by TCM 
are closed linked to these 13 kinds of classes.

According to the above description, we see that it is 
interested to construe a system that infers the objects' 
sub-healthy state and their 13 kinds of TCM syndrome, so as to 
help them recuperating from the sub-health. The system's 
diagram is shown in Fig.2. 
In order to be utilized easily, the object's images of face, 
tongue, eyes are captured by the camera, and their 
corresponding feelings and physical status are inputted by 
keyboard. The features such as facial colors, eye statues, 
tongue colors and textures are extracted. These features 
incorporated with the corresponding data of the feelings and 
the physical features are used to infer the sub-healthy state and 
the TCM syndrome by the constructed inference model. With 
the inferred sub-healthy state and the TCM syndrome, the 
corresponding regimen such as food therapy, physical exercise 
and so on is displayed by the system. Furthermore, by 
repeating in using the system day and day, the showed care 
plan can be adjusted according to the changing tendency of the 
sub-healthy state.

III. DATA COLLECTION AND FEATURE EXTRACTION 
A. Data collection/or training 
The capturing equipments for data collection include a 
computer, a video camera and a camera. Collected data 
includes subjects' images of face, eyes, tongue, hands, and hair. 
Besides those, the corresponding data regarding the degree of 
the subjects' feelings and their various of physical status at that 
time are also recorded, which involve 7 kinds of emotions 
relevant to the Qiqing (derived from the Chinese 7 ,tl'f 
[qiqingD of TCM, and 10 criteria of physical status regarding 
the health proposed by WHO. Table 1 shows the abbreviation 
of all items of the questionnaire and their score range. Where, 
18 questions' scores range from 0 to 5, and 0 means that 
nothing bothers the subject himself. One question's score 
ranges from -5 to 5, and -5 means over-thinness while 5 means 
over-fatness. 5 questions' scores are 0 or 1, where 0 means 
YES and 1 means NO. The subjects give the score of the 
questions displayed on the computer, and these answers are 
collected automatically. 
TABLE 1. LISTS OF THE FEELINGS AND PHYSICAL STATUS 
Score The abbreviation of questions 
range 
0-5 Happy, Angry, Sad, Fear, Forgetful, Surprise, Worry, 
Thinking, Disgust, Fatigue, Positive, Adaptation, Persistence, 
Resistance to ill, Fitness, Teeth state, Muscle and skin state, 
Appetite 
-5-5 Fatness 
o or I Insomnia, Staying up late, Dandruff, White hair, Hair shedding 
Furthermore, the data about the degree of the subjects' 
sub-health state and the TCM syndrome given by 3 TCM 
doctors by observing the captured images and the degree of the 
corresponding feelings and physical status are also recorded. 
The TCM syndrome composes of 13 kinds of classes, which 
are cold, hot, deficiency of vital energy, stagnation of vital 
energy, deficiency of blood, stasis of blood, deficiency of jin, 
phlegm and excessive fluid, heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidney . 
The scores range from 0 to 9, while 0 indicates that the object 
does not suffer from the corresponding class. Further, the 
scores from 1 to 3 indicate the symptom is light, the scores 
from 4 to 6 indicate the intermediate degree, and scores from 7 
to 9 express that the suffering is serious. As we know, TCM is 
of sUbjectivity and the results of diagnosis are often influenced 
by the individual criteria of TCM doctors. The data collected in 
the above process is also affected by the individual difference 
of these 3 doctors. Therefore, how to filter the confused 
information from the collected data is a crucial issue in rule 
mining of TCM diagnosis. In the next section, we focus on 
resolving this problem and propose an algorithm that integrates 
different doctors' diagnosis information for inferring the 
objects' sub-healthy state and their TCM syndrome. 
B. Feature extraction 
In this paper, the feature extraction from facial images and 
eyes' videos are executed. 
Each time when the facial photos are captured, the room's 
light is constant and the distance between the camera and the 
face is constant too. Each facial photo is divided into six blocks 
automatically according the different facial areas, just as Figure 
3 shows. To each block, facial color features in ROB color 
space and YCrCb color space is calculated by the following 
three steps. 
1. In each block, pixels which have not skin-like color 
such as beard, eyebrows and hair are excluded by 
threshold segmentation based on YCrCb 
colorspace[2] . 
2. For all remaining pixels in the block, the average of 
YCrCb color components are calculated as this 
block's YCrCb value. 
3. Converting YCrCb color space into ROB color space.

Figure 3. Facial area division 
Figure 4. Eys's Video Capturing 
During the process of eye video capturing, a subject sits in 
front of the computer screen, about 50 cm away. The camera is 
displaced horizontally on the side of the screen as high as the 
subject's eyes, and the lens is aimed to the subject's face, just 
as Figure 4 shows. When the subject clicks on the start button, 
an animation is showed on the screen. First, the screen colors 
are alternated by black and white in a constant speed of 10 
seconds/frame. Then a red circle with a diameter of one-tenth 
of the screen's height, appears on the screen. It beats on the 
screen randomly and its moving speed changes once every 10 
seconds. Each time the speed is randomly set and saved as a 
parameter. During the capturing, the room's light is constant. 
The subject is asked not to move his face but to track the red 
circle by his eyes. The process lasts for about one minute. After 
the capturing, the circle's moving speed is saved with the 
corresponding captured video. 
The extracted features from eye videos in this paper 
include: frequency deviation of eyes blink, average distance 
deviation between the upper and lower eyelids, matching 
degree of the tracking, the degree of eyes' gloss, ratio of 
venation area and conjunctiva area. 
IV. INFERRING THE SUB-HEALTH STATE AND TCM SYNDROME 
In order to diagnose objects' sub-health state and their 
TCM syndrome automatically with the extracted features such 
as those described above, and the corresponding degrees of 
their feelings and physical status, we take the sub-healthy state 
or each class of TCM syndrome as a conclusion to mine 
association rules from the training data set, and then derive the 
corresponding deducing rules for all of them. Taking into 
account the individual difference of the TCM doctors in 
diagnosis, the proposed association rule mining algorithm 
integrates multiple TCM doctors' diagnosis information. Each 
step of the above method is depicted in the following. 
Data preprocessing 
The degree of the feelings and physical status is regarded as 
the discrete data which does not need any additional process 
for the data mining, whereas the extracted features are the 
continuous data, and it is necessary for each feature to be 
divided into some different intervals, which are used to match 
the corresponding conclusions. In this paper, we use the 
method called CAlM [3] for the feature space division. 
Association rule mining 
This paper uses the CloudApriori algorithm [4] to mine 
association rules from the above-mentioned extracted features 
and the feelings and physical status. There are many 
interval-division methods in the traditional research of 
association rule mining. But those methods are so hard that the 
boundary elements are easily excluded outside the intervals. 
Aimed to solving such problem, paper [5] conducted a concept 
of fuzzy set which make the domain of quantitative properties 
become fuzzy so as to soften the boundary. However, it still 
has its flaw. Once the membership function is defined as a 
precise numerical expression, there are no ambiguity any more 
in the process of concept definition and uncertainty reasoning. 
Accordingly, a concept division method base on Cloud model 
was proposed in [6] which is available in the computation of 
support, confidence and correlation. In this paper, for the 
extracted facial features having fuzzy cross-cutting attribute 
intervals, the minimum support is set to 0.001 and the 
minimum interest is set to 0.83. 
3720 
Rules pruning 
The redundant and repetitive rules are needed to prune from 
the large amount of rules obtained in the previous step. Our 
paper uses three rules pruning methods. Before pruning, sorting 
rules is needed. Algorithm 1 is the rule sorting algorithm. 
Given rule ra and rule rb, ra > rb holds if any of the 
following condition is satisfied. 
1) ra s interest is larger than rb S 
2) ra S interest is equal to rb sand ra s support is larger 
than rb S 
3) ra s interest is equal to rb S, ra S support is equal 
to rb S and attribute number of ra s premise is smaller than 
rb S 
4) ra and rb S interest, support and attribute number of 
premise are all equal, and record number of ra s conclusion 
categories in database is smaller than rb S. 
5) all the items mentioned above are equal, but ra is 
trained earlier than rb 
Algorithml Rule Sorting Algorithm 
The rules pruning algorithm is shown in algorithm 2. 
Assume that R is the association rule set to be pruned and 
T is the training set. 
1) Sort R according to algorithm 1. 
2) Remove rb from R by redundant rules pruning[7}, 
if any two rules ra and rb in R satisfY those conditions: 
ra :fa ?c,rb :fb ?c rb, fa cfb, fa and fb have 
the same attribute intervals, and ra S interest is larger than 
rb S 
3) Use lazy pruning[8}: 
a) To each record t in T , find out the first matching 
rule r from R ,  delete t and record the result of r S 
classification 
b) After all records have been checked in T, delete rule 
r whose correct classification times is 0 while wrong 
classification times is not O. Recheck those records that have 
been covered by r. 
c) Repeat step 3) until there are no those rules whose 
correct classification times is 0 while wrong classification 
times is not O. Add the obtained rules to C 
4) For the rest rules in R use database coverage 
pruning[9}: 
a) For all rules r in R, if r can satisfY the record t 
in T, add r into C and remove all those records in T that can 
be covered with r. 
b) ifr can not satisfY any record, delete it. 
Algorithm 2 Rules Pruning Algorithm 
Rule integration 
Due to the system's high complexity, the uncertainty of 
TCM doctors in diagnosis is caused by the impossibility of 
them to observe and capture all dimensions of the problem. 
The different doctors may give the different diagnosing results 
to the same individual, which leads to the inconsistency of the 
rules mined from the different doctors' diagnostic results. It is 
necessary for us to integrate the rules mined from the different 
doctors' diagnosis results. 
It is noticed that not all the TCM doctors are good at 
diagnosing all the classes of TCM syndrome. It can also been 
seen from Fig. 5. The lines of blue withOmark, pink withD 
mark, and orange with.6.mark indict the inference accuracy of 
association rules regarding the sub-health and 13 classes of the 
TCM syndrome, which are mined from the diagnosing results 
of the TCM doctor #1, #2 and #3 recorded in the training data 
set, respectively. Such inference accuracy is called individual 
inference accuracy. It is obvious that for some certain classes 
of the TCM syndrome, the individual inference accuracy based 
on a certain doctor's diagnosis is pretty higher than the others. 
For example, the 95.5% inference accuracy of the class of 
deficiency of blood was achieved by the rules mined from the 
diagnosing results of doctor #2, while only the 39% accuracy 
was achieved regarding the class of the stasis of blood. It 
assumes that the doctor whose diagnosis for a class can induce 
the higher inference accuracy for the association rule mining is 
regarded as one who is good at diagnosing this class, and the 
uncertainty of hislher diagnosis based on the TCM theory for 
this class is less than the others'. Thus, the rules mined from 
such doctors' diagnosing results are considered to be more 
important than those mined from the other doctors'. Therefore, 
the rules mined by different doctors' diagnosing results are 
needed to integrate by increasing the weight of the rules which 
are mined from the diagnosis information given by the doctor 
whose diagnosis data induced the higher inference accuracy of 
3721 
the corresponding class. Let the rule-set R? include all the 
association rules which are mined from the diagnostic 
information of ith doctor to the conclusion j. The conclusion 
here means the sub-health state or the classes of TCM 
Syndrome. Let PR, indicate the inference accuracy of R? 
J 
calculated by the cross-validation. There are N doctors whose 
diagnosis results were involved in the training data set. So, the 
weight of the rule regarding the conclusion j mined from the 
information given by the ith TCM doctor is given as the 
following: 
P . R'. 
w, = } 
j M 
LPRk k=\ } 
Rule-sets mined from different doctors' 
(1) 
diagnostic 
information may get different results in the same input. And the 
final deductive results are determined by the weighted sum of 
each rule-set's. The final result is the conclusion that has the 
maximum weighted sum. The individual differences of the 
TCM doctors in diagnosing the sub-health state and the 
different classes of the TCM syndrome are considered in the 
rules mining by the rule integration. 
V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
In the experiment, 16 subjects' information was collected 
about 3 times once every two weeks by the method described 
in the subsection 3.1. As a whole, there are 49 records in the 
training data set. The score given by the TCM doctors is 
assigned to one of 4 categories which are normality, slight 
degree, middle degree, and serious degree according to the 
values before the association rule mining. The samples with the 
serious degree have not collected yet. For having a large 
enough training data set, the data collection is continued now, 
especially the samples of the subjects who appear the symptom 
with the serious degree of sub-health. 
The facial color features and the eyes' features are extracted 
from the collected images. These features are incorporated with 
the data of the corresponding feelings and physical status, and 
the data of the sub-healthy state and their TCM syndrome 
given by 3 TCM doctors. Then, 147 records in the data table 
are prepared for the rule mining. The extracted features are 
divided into some different intervals by CAlM. After the 
association rule mining by CloudApriori algorithm, the 
sub-healthy state or the each condition of the TCM syndrome 
has about 110 candidate rules in the case that the conclusion is 
regarded as each doctor's own diagnosis. Those candidate rules 
are pruned and about 34 rules are left for the sub-healthy state 
or each class of the TCM syndrome. The weight of the rule 
regarding the conclusion j mined from the information given 
by the ith TCM doctor is calculated for the rule integration 
according to the equation (1). 
The cross validation is used to verify the effectiveness of 
the mined rules. When testing, the collected data set is divided 
into six groups. Five of them are chosen as training data and 
the rest one is used as the testing data. Results deduced from 
the rules mined from the training data set are compared with 
the conclusions of test data. The rate of the matching number 
divided by the total number of the testing data set is defined as 
the inference accuracy. The average accuracy is calculated by 
10 cross validations in our experiments. 
The inference accuracies of the association rules regarding 
the sub-health and 13 classes of the TCM syndrome, which are 
mined from the individual diagnosis results of 3 TCM doctors 
are shown in Fig.5. The lines of blue withOmark, pink withD 
mark, and orange withLimark indict the inference accuracy of 
the rules mined from the diagnosing results of the TCM doctor 
#1, #2 and #3 recorded in the training data set, respectively. 
Such inference accuracy is called individual inference accuracy. 
The line of green withOmark indicates the accuracies of the 
rules that have been integrated. And the line of purple 
with*mark indicates the accuracies of the non-integrated rules 
which are mined from the average of the diagnostic 
information of the three TCM doctors. Such inference accuracy 
is called integrated inference accuracy.

Figure 5. Inference accuracy 
From Fig.5 we can see that all the 3 individual inference 
accuracies of the sub-health state based on the diagnosis results 
of the three TCM doctors are relatively close and high, and the 
accuracy is up to 91% after the rule integration. That means 
that the collected samples data providing to these doctors have 
the complete information regarding the sub-health, so as to 
they can give the perfect discrimination according to the 
provided data, while such discriminations induce the above 
high inference accuracies. Besides the sub-health, the 
individual inference accuracies of the classes of Cold and 
Kidney are also close and high, which induce the high 
accuracies after the rule integration. However, for the other rest 
classes, the individual inference accuracies based on the 
diagnosis results of the different doctors are very different, 
except the class of hot, for which the individual accuracies are 
all low. It can be considered that the information providing to 
the TCM doctors for diagnosing these classes is incomplete so 
that the doctor who is not good at diagnosing these classes fails 
to give the diagnosis results with the consistency. Accordingly, 
the inference accuracy of the rules mined from such doctor's 
diagnosis can not reach a high level. Only the rules mined from 
the diagnosis results with the consistency can induce the high 
inference accuracy. Therefore, in most cases, the inference 
accuracies are improved by the rules integration compared with 
the lowest ones, they can not be above the highest ones 
achieved based on the individual TCM doctor's diagnosis. 
Similarly, the results derived by the average of the diagnostic 
information of the three TCM doctors, which are shown by the 
plot with the line of purple with*mark in fig. 5, also confirms 
the above statement. 
Moreover, average accuracy of the rules deduced after rule 
integration, is 52%. While the average accuracy of the rules 
mined from the average diagnostic information of the doctors 
is 47%. That is to say that the rule-set after integrating takes 
more the individual difference of TCM doctors' experience 
into account. It is expected that the more the doctors involved 
in the data collection of the diagnosis, the higher the inference 
accuracy can be achieved by the integrated rule sets. Of course, 
involving many TCM doctors in the data collection is not an 
actual approach. Therefore, selecting the rules that can induce 
the highest inference accuracy among the rules mined from the 
diagnosis results of some different TCM doctors as the final 
association rules is a good idea. 
It is also noticed that all the individual and integrated 
inference accuracies of some classes of the TCM syndrome are 
low, especially, the class of Hot. The reasons are supposed that 
the samples collected for TCM doctors' diagnosing such 
classes are very incomplete, or all the TCM doctors asked to do 
the diagnosis are not good at diagnosing such classes. So, 
collecting more samples and inviting more TCM doctors to 
give the diagnosis results for the training data set will be our 
next crucial work to improve the performance of the inference 
model.

VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes a system framework that utilizes the 
visual features of individuals and the information of their 
feelings and physical status to infer their sub-health state and 
the TCM syndrome automatically based on TCM doctors' 
diagnosis knowledge, so as to help the users recuperating from 
the sub-health by showing the corresponding regimen. For 
realizing such a system, in this paper, the method of extracting 
the features from the images of face and eyes is exploited. 
Further, the data set composing of the subjects' images such as 
face, eyes, tongue and so on, the scores of their feelings and 
physical status, and the corresponding degrees of the subjects' 
sub-healthy state and the TCM syndrome given by multiple 
TCM doctors are collected for modeling the TCM doctors' 
diagnosis. On the basis of the collected data set, the association 
rules for inferring the objects' sub-health and physical status 
are mined, while such rules integrate multiple TCM doctors' 
diagnostic information which reflects the individual difference 
of TCM doctors in diagnosis. The experiment shows that, after 
the rule integration, the inference accuracy of the sub-health 
is up to 91 %. However, the average inference accuracy of the 
classes of the TCM syndrome is 52%, which needs to be 
further improved by the way of colleting more samples and the 
corresponding diagnostic information given by TCM doctors 
and incorporating the knowledge of experts into the process of 
the inference. On the other hand, it is expected to improve the 
accuracy further by incorporating the features extracted from 
the images of the tongue into the data set for mining the 
association rules.
