Abstract—For quickly locating the specific user groups in the 
mobile payment market, this paper investigates and analyzes the 
Mobile Ticketing in mobile payment service from five main 
aspects, the users awareness, demand, usage, using willingness 
and users evaluation. We use data mining methods of association 
rules to do analysis to 1615 valid questionnaires and locate the 
user groups who are most likely to use Mobile Ticketing, so as to 
help the Communication Carriers to lock the target customers 
market precisely and quickly at the beginning of promotional 
period of Mobile Payment. The results show that mobile payment 
market, especially mobile ticketing, is still in the early stage, the 
users are with low awareness, the potential user groups are very 
big, the users who are willing to use mobile payment services are 
mostly concentrate in young user groups with high spending 
monthly and high education.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Technological innovation has changed people's lifestyles 
and business models, the popularity of the mobile terminal 
(such as mobile phones, etc.), and the development of mobile 
communication technology have brought changes of the 
payments way, mobile payments has become increasingly 
popular and an important way to pay in Europe and the United 
States, Japan and South Korea. Mobile payment is the payment 
way that In order to purchase tangible or intangible form of 
product, pay fees or receive services, the payment side uses 
mobile phone, PDA and other mobile terminals to realize the 
transfer of funds from payments to the affected party's payment 
through the mobile communication network [1]. 
In 2008, the global mobile e-commerce revenues reached 
554 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 15% of the world's 
online trading market share, the number of global mobile e-
commerce customers reached 1.67 billion; Chinese mobile 
phone subscribers reached 641 million, had more than 70 
million mobile E-commerce users, which indicates that mobile 
payment industry in China have great commercial potential. 
However, the Norson Telecom forecasts show that the growth 
rate of mobile payment user is far lower than the growth rate of 
mobile phone users. What factors influence user perception and 
use of the mobile payment, comparing the interaction between 
the customer perceived value, customer satisfaction and 
behavior tend of these consumers judgments by put them into a 
same research framework will undoubtedly be of great 
significance [2]. Many studies focus on this area. The study [3] 
researched the relationship among the customer perceived 
value, customer satisfaction and behavioral tendencies in the 
mobile payment, and found that the perceived value is the 
antecedent of the customer satisfaction. The study [4] has 
shown that perceived risk, personal innovation, social impact 
and perceived usefulness have a direct significant impact on the 
intention of use. Perceived ease of use and social impact have a 
direct significant impact on perceived usefulness, no direct 
impact on the intent of use, only an indirect effect through 
perceived usefulness. The studies [5-6] suggested that in the 
process of mobile payment, consumers have a lot of 
psychological barriers in the mobile payment, especially the 
security and credit problems directly blow the desire of 
consumer, and seriously hamper the rapid development of 
mobile payment services, and only resolving the question of 
risk perception, mobile payments can have a greater advantage 
than the internet. The study [7] through questionnaire survey 
and analysis to mobile payment users thought that social 
impact have the most significant positive impact on the use 
willing of mobile payments, and the expected utility, cost and 
effort expected have not significantly affect on the use willing 
of mobile payment, facilitating conditions don’t have 
significantly affect on the use behavior, the risk perception has 
a significant positive impact on the use will of mobile payment, 
and the use willing of mobile payment hast a significant 
positive impact on the use behavior. The literature [8] using the 
integration technology acceptance model, analyzed the 
consumers willing of using mobile payment in six aspects 
about perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived 
risk, trust, beliefs and assessment and use attitude, had a certain 
effect to enhance consumer use willing. The above study did 
not mention the characteristics of mobile payment user group 
and potential user groups. It is difficult to determine the target 
customers market in early development stages in the mobile 
payment market 
This article starts from the development of mobile payment 
to pay attention to the user groups and the potential user groups 
of mobile ticket buying lottery tickets and movie tickets and 
other using mobile phone, uses association rules to data

mining, analyzes the characteristics of mobile payment users, 
understands the user perception of mobile payment, demand 
degree as well as the impact of factors of the mobile payment 
use of users, so as to provide the basis for  promoting the 
mobile payment and the determination of the target market

II. ASSOCIATION RULES OF DATA MINING AND 
ALGORITHM 
A. Principles of Mining Association Rules 
Association Rules Mining is proposed to describe the rules 
of a potential relationship among data items in the database by 
R. Agrawal in 1993 [9], which is a research direction of data 
mining (DM) [10-11]. Association Rules Mining can directly 
express the relationship among item sets (all values of 
variables) of data. This relationship is not based on a particular 
distribution of data according to multiple iterations in a specific 
model, but build on the apparently probability of items in the 
data information set. Therefore this method is different from 
the traditional statistical methods; its advantage lies in the clear 
results and easily explained. In practice, association rules is a 
process extracting implicit in the work, people unknown 
before, but potentially useful information and knowledge from 
a large number , not complete, noisy, vague and random 
practical application data[12-14]. While the variable types are 
complicated, the distributions of variables are uncertain and 
difficult to convert, or all variables are independence, can not 
meet the requirements of traditional statistical methods, 
through association rule mining, we can get the information 
implicit in the variable value. 
Set I = {i1, i2, …, im} is the set of all items, D is the 
transaction database, transaction T is a subset of items ?T?I
?. Each transaction has a unique transaction identifier as TID. 
Suppose A is a collection composed by items, called item-set. 
Transaction T contains the item-set A, if and only A?T. If the 
item-set A contains k items, claimed it as k item-sets. The 
percentage of the times of Item-set A appearing in the 
transaction database D hold the total transaction in D is called 
the support degree of item-set. If the support degree of the 
item-set exceeds the minimum support threshold value given 
by the user, then the item-set is called frequent item-set (or 
large item-set). 
Association rule is the logical implicate style in the form of 
X?Y, in which X?I?Y?I, and X?Y=?. If the transaction 
database D, there is s% of the transaction including X?Y, then 
claims that the support degree of association rules X?Y is s%, 
in fact, the support degree is a probability value. If the support 
degree for item-set X is denoted by support (X), the trust 
degree of rules is the support (X?Y) / support (X). This is a 
conditional probability P (Y | X). Namely: support (X?Y) =P 
(X ?Y), confidence (X?Y) =P (Y | X). The association rules 
meeting the minimum support threshold and minimum 
confidence threshold are called strong rules, namely 
association rules. These two threshold values are from 0% to 
100%. 
Lift is a comparison of two possibilities: one is the 
possibility of buying the right merchandise in known case of 
already having purchased goods on the left, and the other one is 
the possibility of buying the right product under any 
circumstances.  
In this article, refers to the ratio of the success rate of 
marketing characteristics group and all group to buy movie 
tickets / lottery business, when choice target customers group, 
the key is to see the gain value, the gain value is greater that the 
possibility of using this business is greater. The standard is the 
same as the selection criteria of other models of data mining, 
by comparison with the "original" rules of, to measure the 
predictive accuracy extent of the rules to improve. 
B. The Basic Algorithm of Association Rules 
The Apriority algorithm Based on the theory of frequent 
item sets is for association rules of the most classical 
algorithms [15-16], which is a approach based on the idea of 
the two-stage frequent set?  the design of association rule 
mining algorithm is decomposed into two sub-problems: 1) to 
find all item-sets which support degree is greater than the 
minimum supports degree, called frequent item-sets; 2) to find 
the desired rules brought by the frequent item-sets found in the 
first step. The generation of candidate item-sets is the core of 
the Apriori algorithm which is for one-dimensional, single-
layer, Boolean association rule mining. 
It is based on the following properties (Apriority 
properties): If an item-set is frequent item-set, then all its 
subsets are frequent item set. Conversely, if a subset of an item 
set is not frequent item set, then the item set is not frequent 
item set. The first step of algorithm is to identify all frequent 
item-sets; step two is to generate the strong association rules by 
frequent item-sets. First is to generate the frequent first-order 
item-set L1, then generate the two-order frequent item-set L2, 
until there is an r value of making Lr is empty, the algorithm 
stops. Here in the k times cycle, the process first created the set 
of candidate k-item-set , Ck, each item-set in the Ck is 
generated by doing (k-2) connections to two frequent item-set 
belong to Lk-1 which only have one different item. the item-
sets in the Ck is used to generate the candidate set of frequent 
sets, the final frequent item set Lk must be a subset of Ck, each 
element in the Ck require to be verified in the transaction 
database to determine whether to join in Lk. 
III. ASSOCIATION RULES ANALYSIS OF MOBILE 
PAYMENT 
A. Data Processing 
In March 2009, the current six areas of China Mobile 
payment (bus swipe, mobile ticketing, mobile phone on-site 
payment, mobile phone online shopping, and mobile phone to 
pay charge, mobile phone to pay public utility tariffs) are 
investigated from the user knowledge, user requirements, the 
situation of use, post-evaluation and future use willing and 
other aspects. The questionnaire is divided into four parts 
totally: the preamble, mainly aimed to illustrate the nature and 
the destination of the survey to the respondents, and to 
introduce the concept of mobile payment and mobile ticketing

to the respondents; the first part of the questionnaire includes 
the screening and classification parts, mainly the screening and 
classification of the respondents through the provision of the 
relevant issues; the second part of the questionnaire is the main 
portion, Mainly on the design of indicators about mobile phone 
ticketing consumer awareness, demand and willing of use; the 
third part of the questionnaire is mainly to survey the basic 
information of respondents about age, sex, occupation, 
educational level, monthly expenditure, location and brand and 
others. The survey first carried out a small sample survey of 50 
copies, analyzing questionnaire’s reliability and validity using 
spss, showed that the reliability was 0.812 and the validity is 
0.863 which are able to meet requirements, then conducted a 
large sample survey, a total of 2182 questionnaires were issued 
and 1626 copies wee recycled, 1615 copies were valid 
questionnaires. By the association rule analysis, we looked 
forward to understand the user awareness and demand degrees 
for mobile payment, as well as the factors of users to pay by 
mobile phone. This paper selected the most representative 
mobile phone ticketing of the current mobile payment to 
analysis. Survey-based data are shown in Tab. I. 
Discretely process attributes age, monthly expenditure, data 
ARPU value and level of education and others of Tab I (packet

B. User’s Awareness Analysis of Mobile Ticketing  
According to question of the survey questionnaire "Do you 
know the mobile phone to buy movie ticket / lottery?" To be 
shown in Fig.1, the statistics of cognition situation of mobile 
phones to buy movie ticket / lottery. According to the statistics 
of the cognition situation in Fig. 1, we can see: users very 
familiar with mobile tickets take up small proportion, about 
30% of users understand, most users only heard but do not 
know the specific features and usage, and even never heard. 
This shows that mobile phone ticketing business is under low 
cognition. Therefore, before the promotion of mobile ticketing 
in mobile payment, we should open up more channels, increase 
investment, increase propaganda efforts, and enhance the 
user’s perception. 
According to question of the survey questionnaire, "Which 
way do you prefer to learn the mobile ticketing of mobile 
company," we can see from Fig. 2: In the statistical analysis of 
user answers, selecting " Introduction messages sent by the 
mobile company's 10086 " and "the publicity / advertising of 
mobile company's Web site "accounted for the most, followed 
by" brochures and advertisements of mobile corporate entity 
operating room or agent "and dialing 10086 to understand, we 
can see that electronic channels is the favorite of customers of 
all ages. Therefore, in the publicity of mobile payment 
business, we should take consumer’s cognitive preferences 
mentioned above into account, publicize is by the ways which 
consumers like.

C. Demand Analysis about Using Mobile Phone to Buy 
Movie Tickets or Lottery 
According to the survey data can be: that the user needs and 
a great need for 42% and 32% of users do not need to think it 
may be necessary in the future, there is no need / want to use 
the business accounts for only 6% of users, its detailed 
distribution of the situation shown in Fig.3. According to the 
statistics of the questionnaire, we analyzed the mobile ticketing 
with association rules, where setting min-sup=10% (minimum 
support), min-con = 10% (minimum confidence), min-lif = 
1(minimum lift), the association rules meeting the minimum 
support, the minimum confidence and the minimum lift are 
obtained, as shown in Tab III.  
131
In Tab III, 42% of the user groups who need and really 
need have the following characteristics: 1) Hunan M-Zone 
users; 2) monthly consumption expenditure under 100 Yuan 
users; 3) Hunan users of university education; 4) data services 
Arup value under 10 Yuan in Hunan M-Zone users; 5) male 
users in Hunan province. We can see from the above 
characteristics: geographical and brands are the main 
recognition factor of this type user; up to 75% of Hunan, M-
Zone users think "mobile phone ticketing useful"; it has a great 
relationship with the use of brand M-Zone users, mostly from 
universities and younger age groups, targeted at the depth of 
marketing, so that the user not only think that "useful" but also 
to "use" mobile phone ticketing.

D. Using Willing Analysis on Buying Movie Tickets or 
Lottery by Mobile Phones 
According to the survey data ,we can obtain that under the 
situation of meeting the user interest factors, within the next 
year and may using or certainly using mobile phones to buy 
movie tickets lottery customers account for 75%, the users 
definitely not using the business only account for 7% (see Fig 
3). According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we 
conducted the "Mobile ticketing will" association rules 
analysis, where to setting min-sup = 10%, min-con = 10%, 
min-lif = 1, the association rules meeting the minimum support 
(see Tab IV). 
In Tab IV, the characteristics of user groups 75% of which 
will certainly be, and may use in the next year: 1) users with 
monthly expenditure over 2001 Yuan and aged 23-35 years 
old; 2) Beijing GSM users; 3) users with expenditures over 
2001 Yuan in the Shanghai; 4) expenditures over 2001 Yuan 
and college-educated employees; 5) the employees with 
consumption expenditures over 2001 Yuan. We can see from 
the above characteristics: Monthly consumption expenditure, 
age, education is the main identifying factors of this type 
customer,; up to 90.2% at the age of 23-35 years old and 
expenditures over 2001 Yuan per-month users will use mobile 
ticketing; this part of the group tended to have relatively higher 
incomes, young to  have good receptive to new things, it 
should be targeted at young people in higher income groups for 
targeted marketing, and then continued to increase customer 
awareness.  
Suppose the factors that you are concerned are  meeting in
the coming year,will you choose to use or continue to use
mobile ticketing?

E. Features Analysis of Users with Low Awareness and High 
Demand on Mobile Ticketing 
According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we 
conducted the "Low awareness and high demand on mobile 
ticketing" association rules analysis, where to setting min-sup = 
10%, min-con = 10%, min-lif = 1, the association rules meeting 
the minimum support (see Tab V). According to the users’ 
Features, we can conclude that: 1) Hunan M-Zone users; 2) 
Data Services ARPU Less than 10 Yuan’s Hunan users; 3) 
Data Services ARPU Less than 10 Yuan’s M-Zone users; 4) 
Data Services ARPU Less than 35 Yuan’s M-Zone users; 5) 
male college-educated M-Zone users. We can see from the 
above Features: Brand, Region and Data Services ARPU is the 
main identifying factors of this type customer; While the 
mobile ticketing business in Hunan have been carried out, but 
awareness is not very high?so Communication carriers should 
have to publicize and promote for M-Zone users that the Data 
Services ARPU is Less than 10 Yuan.

F. Features Analysis of Users with Demand on Mobile 
Ticketing 
According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we 
conducted the "with demand but have not used mobile ticketing 
yet" association rules analysis, where to setting min-sup = 
10%, min-con = 10%, min-lif = 1, the association rules meeting 
the minimum support (see Tab VI). According to Tab VI, the 
user groups’ Features of demand but not use about mobile 
ticketing about mobile ticketing: 1) expenditures over 2001 
Yuan and college-educated employees; 2) college-educated 
female employees; 3) M-ZONE users with aged 23-35 years 
old and college-educated; 4) users with monthly expenditure 
over 2001 Yuan and aged 23-35 years old. We can see from the 
above Features: Age, monthly expenditure and Education are 
the main identifying factors of this type customer. Up to 82% 
expenditures from 1001 to 2000 Yuan per-month and college-
educated employee will use mobile ticketing. This type user 
will become the Potential users about mobile ticketing. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
To find the Specific user groups quickly when marketing in 
the mobile payment, this article investigated and analyzed 
Mobile Ticketing field of mobile payment service from the 
user's awareness, demand, usage, evaluation after use, 
willingness of using and so on by using data mining methods 
of association rules, and also located user groups who most 
likely to use Mobile Ticketing. It can help the Communication 
carriers to Market Precisely by quickly locking the market of 
the target customers at beginning of Mobile Payment 
Promotion.  
The results showed that: mobile ticketing market is still in 
its early stage; the user’s awareness is low and potential user 
groups are large; Already the user used or the user wishes to 
use mostly concentrated in the higher spending and higher 
educated group of young users. Thus, at the initial stage of 
Mobile Payment Promotion, the Communication carriers 
should take into account comprehensively the user's group 
feature, Simplicity of operation, convenience of Opening and 
safety of use about mobile ticketing and so on. The 
Communication carriers should develop a user's perception, let 
them feel the convenience and practicality and seize the 
potential users of low awareness by widely publicizing. 
Mobile payment market involves bus swipe, mobile 
ticketing, mobile phone on-site payment, mobile phone online 
shopping, and mobile phone to pay charge, mobile phone to 
pay public utility tariffs and so on. This article only 
explanatorily study on the user groups’ features of mobile 
ticketing. It will be the need for further research about how to 
record and track existing user groups and potential user groups 
and how to analyze and compare the user groups’ features of 
the different mobile pay areas.
