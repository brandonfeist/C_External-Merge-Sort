Abstract—Geo-ontology has great of Significance in addressing 
the knowledgeable heterogeneity of geodatabases due to lack 
of semantic association, achieving information share and 
interoperation of the GIS data. It will greatly reduce the 
workload of building a Geo-ontology by building Geo-ontology 
automatically based-on geodatabase, and the sticking point is 
defined the mapping rules from geodatabase to Geo-ontology 
in this process. Firstly, this article researches the mapping 
rules from the relational database to ontology, compares and 
analyzes the difference of mapping methods; and then drawn 
the semantic mapping rules from geodatabase to 
Geo-ontology; finally, builds the Geo-ontology.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
With the development of GIS, GIS data grows rapidly. In 
order to achieve the full utilization of the information, how 
to share and interoperate data becomes a serious problem. 
The mapping from geodatabase to the Geo-ontology could 
provide context-sensitive semantics for different geographic 
data, and thus the interoperability in heterogeneous 
geographic data become truly.  
Recently, the ontology becomes more concerned and the 
research of Geo-ontology graphical has many results. It’s 
mainly concentrated on geographic information integration, 
discovery and retrieval, etc. However, the study of building 
Geo-ontology is still in the phase of hand-building, auxiliary 
building. To achieve the automatic construction of 
Geo-ontology, this article starts at the difficulty of building 
Geo-ontology – studies the mapping from geodatabase to the 
Geo-ontology, makes mapping rules from the geodatabase to 
the Geo-ontology which adapted to the geographical area 
based on the analysis and comparison of mapping method 
from a relational data model to the ontology, and takes 
spatial database of river basin as an example to illuminate 
the construction of Geo-ontology.  
II. THE RESEARCH OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC 
As the important role that Geo-ontology plays was 
recognized, foreign and domestic research institutions and 
scholars started to pay attention ontology research, and there 
are lots of results in the data model and ontology mapping 
research. As the complexity of geographic data’s relationship, 
there are more research in relational database model and 
inter-ontology mapping. 
A.  Foreign 
1) On behalf of the early research about relational 
database schema and ontology mapping is: Vrije University 
of the Netherlands developed a web-based access method 
mapping tools in 2004--FDR2#Kit [2]. 
The map building process can be divided into three steps:  
a) According to the relational database to establish 
the corresponding relational database schema; 
b) Automatically change the relational database 
schema into ontology in the form of expression;

c) Users manually build a relational database model 
and simple inter-ontology mappings, and expressed in the 
form RD Map in the end. 
2) Onto Grate [3] was developed at the University Oregon 
United States in 2006, which was a relational database 
model and inter-ontology mapping system. It consists of six 
mainly functional modules: syntax converter, map 
generation module, reasoning module, learning module, 
excavation module, the user interface module. Its 
implementation process as following: At first use the syntax 
converter and convert relational database models and 
ontology to the middle of the model which uses Web-PDDL 
language to describe respectively, and then complemented 
by human involvement, built the mapping between the two 
intermediate models by mapping generation module.  
B.  Domestic 
1) MASON [5] was developed as a common 
inter-relational database models and ontology mapping tool 
in Southeast University, 2006. It is to use pre-defined 
transformation rules firstly, convert the relational database 
schema and the ontology to the intermediate model, then 
take in the string compare-based mapping algorithm and the 
structure-based of SF algorithms, at last search between the 
simple corresponding in the elements and output.  
2) Zhuo-Ming Xu [6] given a semantics-preserving way 
from the ER model to OWL DL ontology. This method 
limits single inheritance between the entities based on the 
formalized representation of ER model, and establishes the 
corresponding concept between ER model and OWL DL 
ontology. It achieves mode conversion by an algorithm 
which in accordance with a predefined set of mapping rules, 
and develops ER2WO. 
C.  Analysis and Comparison 
From the above research situation between foreign and 
domestic, generally the mapping between relational 
database schema and ontology can be divided as follows:  
1) Directly extract the ontology from the relational 
database. Its advantages and disadvantages: Directly 
extracted ontology from a relational database, had a high 
degree of automation, the transformation between the data 
model and ontology can be achieved by just make a 
database mapping rules. The relationship between the data 
model which implicit in the entities can be able to 
demonstrate clearly, and the database data change into 
ontology instances. However, as the database schema and 
the ontology structure is not completely consistent, direct 
extraction ontology is not necessarily able to obtain the 
required one. It’s mainly applicable to the automatic 
ontology building in a small amount of data.  
2) Convert through intermediate models between 
relational databases and ontology. Its advantages and 
disadvantages: The conversion method that through 
intermediate model between relational databases and 
ontology, which can truly achieve the semantic 
representations between the database schema and the 
ontology. However, it is more complex and less automated, 
and requires a pre-given correlation exists between the 
ontology and database. It’s mainly applied to the area to 
switch between different data models.  
III.  GEO-ONTOLOGY AND GEODATABASE 
A.  Geo-ontology 
Ontology is a philosophy, information science concept, 
which is introduced to the geographical area of science, 
Geo-Ontology refers to the geographical areas of knowledge, 
information and data are abstracted into one common nature 
of an object or entity, and makes a treatment of clear 
definition and conceptualization, ultimately, gives formal 
expression of the theory and method [1]. 
In general, Geo-ontology includes: geographic areas of 
concepts (classes), a concept as well as the geographical 
characteristics of the relationship between the data 
(instances). The concepts which exist in Geo-ontology are 
not isolated between them there is a certain level of relations 
and semantic relations. Geo-Ontology not only has the 
general properties of identity, but also has the unique spatial 
characteristics. In addition to need describe the attribute 
information, the Geo-ontology also need describe the 
geographic information in spatial information, as the 
location relationship, topological relationship, and the 
relationship between part and whole. 
315
B.  Geodatabase 
Geodatabase refers to a region on the characteristics of a 
certain geographical elements of data collection. Spatial data 
are generally stored as vector data, raster data, as well as in 
the traditional sense of the property sheet. An RDBMS table 
can be used to store an element of the collection, and each 
row in the table is to save an element, which the Shape field 
is, storage space for elements of geometry or shape 
information. However, Raster and image data are stored in 
relational tables.  
IV.   BUILDING THE GEO-ONTOLOGY BASED ON 
THE GEODATABASE 
Traditionally, the ways of building the ontology mostly 
rely on handcrafted tools to achieve after analyzing the 
database structure and table content, it is possible in the case 
of small amount of data. However, geographic data has a 
great amount of complex spatial relationships, building 
corresponding Geo-ontology is an extremely complex, 
time-consuming and labor-intensive process following the 
traditional method. Building the Geo-ontology should be 
creating a new approach according to the characteristics and 
storage of geographical data. Automatic building ontology 
becomes a new direction for building a Geo-ontology 
because of greatly reducing the workload in the process. 
Below, we analyze the existence of difficulties on the 
automatic building process, set down mapping rules between 
geodatabase and Geo-ontology, and initially achieve the 
automatic building of Geo-ontology by programmed 
algorithm according to the rules. 
A.   The difficulties of Semantic Association 
There is a certain link between geodatabase and 
Geo-ontology. Geodatabase contains multiple data tables, 
which has 1 vs. 1, 1 vs. multiple, multiple vs. multiple 
relationships. Each data sheet is made up of a number of 
fields, and records are the field value in the table; 
Geo-ontology contains more than one class, and there is a 
certain level of relationship among classes; each class has 
multiple attributes, and instances are the collection of 
attribute values.  
 
Figure1 the relation of the geodatabase and the geo-ontology 
This provides the basis for mapping from geodatabase to 
the Geo-ontology. However, geodatabase and Geo-ontology 
model are not entirely consistent; there are still many 
difficulties to truly realize the corresponding semantic 
association despite of a simple mapping. The main 
difficulties are: 
1) How to select Geo-ontology concepts (classes) from 
multiple tables in the geodatabase, and establish the 
hierarchy of concepts. 
2) How to determine the relationship among concepts 
(classes). It is mainly the spatial relationships between 
concepts, namely, topology, location relationship. 
3) How to obtain instances for building the Geo-ontology 
from vast amounts of geographic data in the geodatabase. 
B.  Establish the Mapping Rules 
OWL is an ontology language, which is defined and 
instanced, and it use object-oriented approach to describe the 
domain knowledge, describe the character and relation of 
classes and attributes through axioms and constraints. 
According the ability of expression and calculation, OWL 
can be divided into three seeds Language: OWL Lite, OWL 
DL and OWL Full. OWL DL support users that need the 
strongest expression in the reasoning system, which can 
guarantee the integrality and decidability of calculation. 
Considering further study after building the Geo-ontology, 
this paper uses OWL DL as Geo-ontology description 
language. 
Based on the above understanding, we can use OWL 
language to describe and express the concepts and their 
relationships, and establish the mapping rules from the 
geodatabase to the Geo-ontology: 
316
1) Analysis geospatial data table in geodatabase, study out 
the table name as the important concepts of the domain, and 
select the key concept to express the domain knowledge as 
much as possible. In the concepts, refer the categories of 
basic geographic information to determine the level of their 
relationship; finally, the selected concept will be mapped 
Geo-ontology class or sub-class: 
A data table T ?<owl:Class  rdf:ID= TName/>; 
Many data tables (for example, two data tables) T1, T2, 
there is "father-son" relationship, T2 is T1 sub-categories 
?<owl:Class  rdf:ID="T2Name"> 
<rdfs:subClassOf> 
<owl:Class  rdf:ID="T1Name"/>  
     </rdfs:subClassOf> 
</owl:Class> 
2) In the geodatabase, the attribute information is stored in 
the data tables in form of field; field is mapped to 
Geo-ontology’s data type property: 
Field that contains the attribute information F 
?<owl:DatatypeProperty  rdf:ID="FName/"> 
3) Spatial relations can be mapped to object properties in 
the geodatabase, and it describes the spatial relations of 
geographic elements by defining the domain and range of 
attribute:  
Field that contains the spatial relationship F, geographical 
factors A1, A2 exist spatial relationships 
? <owl:ObjectProperty  rdf:ID="FName "> 
     <rdfs:domain  rdf:resource="A1?A2?" />  
     <rdfs:range  rdf:resource=" A2?A1?" />  
 </owl:ObjectProperty> 
In addition, the spatial relations can also describe by the 
multi-nested structure of OWL ontology. It is able to express 
clearly the spatial relationships of geographic factors, but 
there are many difficulties to achieve, especially a large 
amount of data. 
4) In the geodatabase, records are mapped to Geo-ontology 
instances. Field names are mapped to the name of ontology 
instance, attribute data are mapped to the DatatypeProperty 
value of ontology instance; the spatial data are mapped to 
ObjectProperty value. 
C.  Building River Basin Geo-ontology  
According to the mapping rules from the geodatabase to 
Geo-ontology, using water spatial database of river basin as 
an example, we can build river basin Geo-ontology by the 
Java programming language and Jena tools. Specific 
methods: firstly, obtain the geo-ontological structure from 
water spatial database of river basin based on the mapping 
rule; and then use the ontology building tools to optimize the 
structure of Geo-ontology; finally, records which were 
stored in the database are mapped to instances of 
Geo-ontology. Therefore, the appropriate river basin 
Geo-ontology creates.  
The description is that tables of spatial database of river 
water correspond to the Geo-ontology class: 
 
The description is that fields of water spatial database of 
river basin correspond to the Geo-ontology properties 
(including spatial relations):  
 
The description is that records of water spatial database of 
river basin correspond to instances of Geo-ontology:

V.   CONCLUSION  
The building of Geo-ontology is a huge and complex 
process. At present, there are not yet fully mature in theory 
and in practice, and we need to further research and 
development. Based on geodatabase, Geo-ontology theory, 
we analysis the current mapping method from the relational 
database to ontology, try and put forward the mapping rules 
from the geodatabase to the Geo-ontology and build the 
corresponding Geo-ontology by the rules based-on water 
spatial data of river basin. This is only the first step of 
solving GIS application in interoperability, more research 
and work will be done on the semantic reasoning and search 
of the GIS applications in the future.
